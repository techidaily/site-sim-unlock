Having an unlocked device can have its benefits but most of the time most people don’t even know whether their device is SIM locked or not. In this article we are going to address this issue. We are going to begin by helping you find out whether your phone is locked or not and if it is, how you can <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/unlock-android-screen/" >sim unlock <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> the Realme 12 Pro 5G device and enjoy the benefits of an unlocked phone.</p><h2 id="Part-1-How-to-Know-if-your-Android-is-SIM-Locked"><a href="#Part-1-How-to-Know-if-your-Android-is-SIM-Locked" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: How to Know if your Android is SIM Locked"></a>Part 1: How to Know if your Android is SIM Locked</h2><p>It is important to note that not all phones are SIM locked. You can find out if yours is by checking the Realme 12 Pro 5G device’s documentation. If you see the words “unlocked” on the initial receipt then you know that the Realme 12 Pro 5G device is not SIM locked.</p><p>Another easy way to find out is to ask your carrier if the Realme 12 Pro 5G device is locked on to their network. You can also just try inserting another carrier’s SIM into your device. If it doesn’t work, you will know that the Realme 12 Pro 5G device is SIM locked.</p><p>If you bought your device from a third party re-seller such as Amazon you are more likely to be in possession of an unlocked device.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-SIM-Unlock-your-Android-Device"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-SIM-Unlock-your-Android-Device" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to SIM Unlock your Android Device"></a>Part 2: How to SIM Unlock your Android Device</h2><p>If you find that your SIM is locked, here’s a few things you can do to unlock the Realme 12 Pro 5G device.</p><p>Avoid all of the apps on the Google Play Store that promise to unlock your device, most of them don’t work and may even harbour a lot of Trojans and malware that will cause further problems for you and your device.</p><p>There are safe and very legal ways to unlock your device. Just try one of the following.</p><p><strong><em>Ask your Carrier to Unlock your Device</em></strong></p><p>This is the best option when you want to safely unlock your device. By February 2015, American cell phone owners got the option to request their carriers to unlock their device for them. Before that the law didn’t allow for carriers to unlock SIM cards in the United States. This unpopular law was reversed following a similar move by the European Union in 2013. The same law also requires that the carriers inform customers every month whether their device is eligible for unlocking.</p><p>If your device is eligible for unlocking, all you need to do is contact the carrier provide and request for the <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/unlock/unlock-samsung-sim-network-unlock-pin.html" >sim network unlock pin <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. But if your Smartphone was bought on a contract, you may need to pay a termination fee to break the contract of you want to unlock the Realme 12 Pro 5G device before the contact term expires. For Smartphones that are not on contract, you have to wait 12 months from the date of purchase and ensure that your bill is paid before the carrier can give you the unlock code.</p><p><strong><em>How to Unlock your Android Phone</em></strong></p><p>To begin with, you need to confirm your IMEI number. Dial *#06# on your device and the IMEI number will appear on the screen. Copy this number to a secure location or wrote it down somewhere.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2016/06/14670084741192.jpg"                      alt="How to Unlock your Android Phone"                ></p><p>The next step is to find a reputable service that will unlock your Android device for you. This is action you should take only if you are absolutely desperate and your carrier can’t unlock your device for you. This is because many of these sites are unregulated and many of them are not reliable.</p><p>You should also know that many of them will charge a certain amount for your service. You can try <a class="link"   href="https://www.safeunlockcode.com/" >https://www.safeunlockcode.com/ <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> which is one of the more reputable ones we have found.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2016/06/14670084936436.jpg"                      alt="android SIM unlock-safeunlockcode"                ></p><p>You will need to enter the IMEI number as part of the information you need to provide before they can unlock your device.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Troubleshooting-Android-SIM-Unlock"><a href="#Part-3-Troubleshooting-Android-SIM-Unlock" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Troubleshooting Android SIM Unlock"></a>Part 3: Troubleshooting Android SIM Unlock</h2><p>There are lots of issues you may face when you try to unlock your device. The following are just some of the troubleshooting actions you can take if you encounter these problems.</p><p><strong><em>Unlocking Code Fails to work</em></strong></p><p>If you asked your carrier to unlock your device for you, chances are that they sent you a code. If the unlocking code fails to work double check that the IMEI number you used is the correct one and ensure that you purchased that device from that carrier and then try again.</p><p><strong><em>Samsung Device Freezes during unlocking</em></strong></p><p>If your device freezes during the unlocking process it typically means that you entered wrong unlocking code too many times. In this case you need to contact the carrier for a Master Code.</p><p><strong><em>My LG device won’t unlock</em></strong></p><p>There are some LG models that cannot be unlocked. These models include LG U300, LG U310, LG U8180, LG U8330, LG U8120, LG U8360, LG U8380, LGU880, and LG U890. If your device is one of these it can’t be unlocked by your carrier. You may need to look into other ways of unlocking your device.</p><h2 id="How-To-Change-Your-SIM-PIN-Code-on-Your-Realme-12-Pro-5G-Phone"><a href="#How-To-Change-Your-SIM-PIN-Code-on-Your-Realme-12-Pro-5G-Phone" class="headerlink" title="How To Change Your SIM PIN Code on Your Realme 12 Pro 5G Phone"></a>How To Change Your SIM PIN Code on Your Realme 12 Pro 5G Phone</h2><p>When you get a new SIM card, it usually comes with a default PIN (Personal Identity Number) code printed on the packaging, documentation, or back of the SIM card. This 4-digit code protects your phone number from unauthorized calls, texts, and data use. It’s essential to change the default PIN to one that’s both memorable for you and difficult for others to guess.</p><p>So, <strong>how to change the PIN on an Android phone</strong>’s SIM card? This article will provide a step-by-step guide to help you secure your data. But first, let’s explore why changing the default one is important.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/02/how-to-change-pin-on-android-phone-01.jpg"                      alt="a phone sim card"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-Why-Does-Changing-Your-SIM-PIN-Code-Matter-on-a-New-Phone"><a href="#Part-1-Why-Does-Changing-Your-SIM-PIN-Code-Matter-on-a-New-Phone" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Why Does Changing Your SIM PIN Code Matter on a New Phone?"></a>Part 1: Why Does Changing Your SIM PIN Code Matter on a New Phone?</h2><p>Your SIM PIN code acts as a password for your SIM card, which stores your phone number, contacts, and other essential data. Unlike the PIN you use to unlock your phone, the SIM PIN code is a separate layer of security. If someone tries to use your SIM card in another phone without the correct PIN, they won’t be able to access your network or data.</p><p>Here are more reasons why <strong>changing the PIN code of a SIM card</strong> is a smart move:</p><ul><li>Default PINs are easy to guess</li></ul><p>Most carriers use generic PINs like “1234” or “0000”. Change it to something unique and harder to crack.</p><ul><li>Protects data in case of loss or theft</li></ul><p>If you lose your phone or it gets stolen, a strong PIN code hinders the thief’s ability to make calls, send messages, or access your data stored on the SIM. It buys you time to report the loss and block your SIM card before they can do any damage.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/02/how-to-change-pin-on-android-phone-02.jpg"                      alt="sim card locked"                ></p><ul><li>Prevents accidental PIN lockouts</li></ul><p>Using a memorable PIN minimizes the risk of accidentally locking yourself out of your SIM card.</p><ul><li>Peace of mind</li></ul><p>It is crucial if you store sensitive info on your SIM or use your phone for work. Knowing about this extra safeguard is reassuring, ensuring your data stays protected.</p><p><strong>Remember:</strong></p><p>Choose a PIN code for your SIM that’s easy for you to remember but challenging for others to guess. Avoid using birthdays, anniversaries, or other easily identifiable information. By taking a few minutes to <strong>change the PIN code of the SIM card</strong>, you’ll gain a significant security advantage for your new phone and data.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-To-Change-Pin-on-Android-Phone-SIM-Cards"><a href="#Part-2-How-To-Change-Pin-on-Android-Phone-SIM-Cards" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How To Change Pin on Android Phone SIM Cards?"></a>Part 2: How To Change Pin on Android Phone SIM Cards?</h2><p>Keeping your SIM card secure is crucial for protecting your data and privacy. Thankfully, Android allows you to easily change your SIM card PIN to a more personal and memorable code. But before you begin:</p><ul><li>Contact your network carrier to get your PUK code if you already have it. You’ll need this if you enter the wrong PIN three times and lock your SIM card.</li><li>Remember the temporary default PIN: Most SIM cards have a default PIN, often 1234 or 0123. If you haven’t changed it, this is the PIN you’ll use initially.</li></ul><p><strong>Note:</strong></p><p>Entering the wrong PIN three times will lock your SIM card. You’ll need your network carrier’s PUK code to unlock it. Use it cautiously, as exceeding the maximum number of attempts will permanently block your SIM card. So, it’s best to memorize your PIN or store it securely to avoid relying on the PUK altogether.</p><p>Steps To Change Your SIM PIN</p><p>Here’s <strong>how to find and manage the SIM PIN code on Android</strong>:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Navigate to your phone’s <strong>Settings</strong> app. Next, look for the <strong>Security and privacy</strong> or <strong>Lock screen and security</strong> (or other similar option) depending on your device’s model.</li><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Scroll down and tap on <strong>More security settings</strong> or <strong>Other security settings</strong>.</li><li><strong>Step 3:</strong> Tap <strong>SIM card security</strong> or <strong>Set up SIM card lock</strong> (or something similar).</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/02/how-to-change-pin-on-android-phone-03.jpg"                      alt="sim card security in settings"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Step 4:</strong> If you have multiple SIMs, select the one you want to change the PIN code.</li><li><strong>Step 5:</strong> Tap <strong>Change SIM PIN</strong>.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/02/how-to-change-pin-on-android-phone-04.jpg"                      alt="change sim pin code on android"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Step 6:</strong> Input your current SIM card PIN code and tap <strong>OK</strong>.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/02/how-to-change-pin-on-android-phone-05.jpg"                      alt="enter old sim pin"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Step 7:</strong> Enter your desired new PIN code and tap <strong>OK</strong>.</li><li><strong>Step 8:</strong> Re-enter your new SIM card PIN code and tap <strong>OK</strong> to confirm.</li></ul><p>Success!

But for iPhone users, forgetting it can lock you out. So, what should you do if you <strong>lose the SIM PIN</strong> code on iOS?</p><p>First, avoid guessing your SIM PIN or PUK code. Every wrong guess increases the risk of permanently locking your SIM card, requiring a replacement. If you forget your PIN, contact your network carrier for help. They can usually unlock your SIM with the default PIN or PUK code. If that fails, you can request a new SIM card.</p><p>However, there might also be situations where you’re locked out due to a carrier-restricted SIM card.

Phones are our life source in this global age, it’s our tether to reality, to the world! But if you have a carrier locked phone, then that connection is basically under contract by an external agency! You can’t change your networks, there are limitations on how you use your phone, and when you have to travel abroad you have no option other than paying the roaming charges. If you, say, have an iPhone 5c and have these frustrations, it’s likely you’re already wondering how to unlock the iPhone 5c.</p><p>Chances are that if you’ve had a carrier locked phone for a while, you might have already forgotten what cellular freedom feels like. But we’re here to remind you. All you have to do is break that carrier-lock, and you’re good to go. However, you should be careful when doing so, cause if you try using a jailbreaking technique, it could have major repercussions. So we’re here to give you some valuable advice about how to unlock iPhone 5, iPhone 5c, or even Android phones.</p><h2 id="Part-1-Unlock-SIM-Card-on-Realme-12-Pro-5G-via-jailbreak"><a href="#Part-1-Unlock-SIM-Card-on-Realme-12-Pro-5G-via-jailbreak" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Unlock SIM Card on Realme 12 Pro 5G via jailbreak"></a>Part 1: Unlock SIM Card on Realme 12 Pro 5G via jailbreak</h2><p>Before we get into telling you how to unlock iPhone 5, or the SIM Card on iPhone or Android, we should first tell you what Jailbreaking is. You might have heard of this term before, and I’m sure it sounded ominous to you. Jailbreak? It sounds awfully close to ‘Prison break.’ Well, considering the carrier lock is sort of like a prison for your cell, it is an accurate terminology. But Jailbreak isn’t just about breaking the carrier lock. That might happen as a by-product, but the real purpose is to break free of the software restrictions which are generally applied to Apple devices. This might seem like a good option because, well, who doesn’t want to break free of all of Apple’s restrictions? But that always comes at several heavy risks.</p><h3 id="Threats-of-unlocking-SIM-via-Jailbreak"><a href="#Threats-of-unlocking-SIM-via-Jailbreak" class="headerlink" title="Threats of unlocking SIM via Jailbreak"></a>Threats of unlocking SIM via Jailbreak</h3><h4 id="1-Not-Permanent"><a href="#1-Not-Permanent" class="headerlink" title="1. Not Permanent"></a>1. Not Permanent</h4><p>This has got to be one of the biggest reasons for not jailbreaking your phone. It is not at all permanent! In fact, the moment you update your system, your jailbreak is lost and if you’ve started using a different SIM it will no longer function, and you’re gonna have to go back to using that Carrier you tried so hard to escape from! It’s really not worth the effort. Of course, you could stop updating altogether, but then that will bring us to…</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2016/10/14771444107532.jpg"                      alt="Unlock SIM Card on iPhone and Android via jailbreak"                ></p><h4 id="2-Risky"><a href="#2-Risky" class="headerlink" title="2. Risky"></a>2. Risky</h4><p>If you don’t update your iOS, or Mac or iPad or any device at all, in this day and age, you’re basically just asking to be hacked. That is not to excuse those who do the hacking and plant malware on your system, but if you leave your front door open in a shitty neighborhood, well then you only have yourself to blame once you get robbed!</p><h4 id="3-Warranty"><a href="#3-Warranty" class="headerlink" title="3. Warranty"></a>3. Warranty</h4><p>Jailbreaking has now become kind-of-legal, in a very tenuous sense, but that doesn’t mean Apple wholeheartedly welcomes jailbreaking. If you do so, you will never again be able to avail of the warranty on your phone. And with the kind of major bucks you have to shell out for those iPhones, you best keep that warranty intact.</p><h4 id="4-Lack-of-Apps"><a href="#4-Lack-of-Apps" class="headerlink" title="4. Lack of Apps"></a>4. Lack of Apps</h4><p>Many top-notch and crucial app companies and organizations simply refuse to make their applications usable in jailbreak phones, as they are extremely risky and prone to hacking. As a result, you would have to rely on a bunch of non-professional apps made by amateurs, which is more likely to put your phone in harm’s way.</p><h4 id="5-Bricking"><a href="#5-Bricking" class="headerlink" title="5.

As a result, you’re gonna’ have to restore the whole thing and try to salvage whatever information you can. Now those who do jailbreak regularly will give you all kinds of excuses like it happens only rarely or that you can retrieve your data simply from the cloud, et al. But do you really want to divest all your time and energy trying to fight off malware, backing up all your data, etc, especially when there is a much more convenient option just around the corner?</p><p>Didn’t think so.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-unlock-SIM-Card-on-iPhone-without-jailbreak-Bonus"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-unlock-SIM-Card-on-iPhone-without-jailbreak-Bonus" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to unlock SIM Card on iPhone without jailbreak[Bonus]"></a>Part 2: How to unlock SIM Card on iPhone without jailbreak[Bonus]</h2><p>As mentioned above, unlocking by jailbreaking is risky and only temporary.

Up until a while back, one of the reasons people chose to jailbreak their phones is because the legitimate means was such a headache in which you had to contact the carrier and request a change, and even then they could refuse after several weeks of ‘verification.’ However, now with the slow introduction of apps that can essentially do all the work for you, within a matter of 48 hours, it really makes no sense to jailbreak. So now we’ll tell you how to unlock iPhone 5c using an Online iPhone unlock tool called DoctorSIM Unlock Service.</p><p>SIM Unlock Service is really quite the revolutionary tool which just needs your IMEI code and can do all the work for you and send you the unlock code within a guaranteed period of 48 hours! It is safe, it is legal, it is hassle-free, and it doesn’t even lapse your warranty, which proves that it is an officially approved means of unlocking your iPhone. However, before we tell you how to unlock iPhone 5, you should probably be able to verify if your phone is unlocked already.</p><h2 id="Part-4-How-to-unlock-SIM-Card-on-iPhone-with-iPhoneIMEI-net-without-jailbreak"><a href="#Part-4-How-to-unlock-SIM-Card-on-iPhone-with-iPhoneIMEI-net-without-jailbreak" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: How to unlock SIM Card on iPhone with iPhoneIMEI.net without jailbreak"></a>Part 4: How to unlock SIM Card on iPhone with iPhoneIMEI.net without jailbreak</h2><p><a class="link"   href="https://appleiphoneunlock.uk/network/Special%20Services/Activation%20Lock?aff=wondershare" >iPhoneIMEI.net <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> uses an official method to unlock iPhone devices and whitelist your IMEI from Apple’s database.

Having an unlocked device can have its benefits but most of the time most people don’t even know whether their device is SIM locked or not. In this article we are going to address this issue. We are going to begin by helping you find out whether your phone is locked or not and if it is, how you can <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/unlock-android-screen/" >sim unlock <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> the Realme 12 5G device and enjoy the benefits of an unlocked phone.</p><h2 id="Part-1-How-to-Know-if-your-Android-is-SIM-Locked"><a href="#Part-1-How-to-Know-if-your-Android-is-SIM-Locked" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: How to Know if your Android is SIM Locked"></a>Part 1: How to Know if your Android is SIM Locked</h2><p>It is important to note that not all phones are SIM locked. You can find out if yours is by checking the Realme 12 5G device’s documentation. If you see the words “unlocked” on the initial receipt then you know that the Realme 12 5G device is not SIM locked.</p><p>Another easy way to find out is to ask your carrier if the Realme 12 5G device is locked on to their network. You can also just try inserting another carrier’s SIM into your device. If it doesn’t work, you will know that the Realme 12 5G device is SIM locked.</p><p>If you bought your device from a third party re-seller such as Amazon you are more likely to be in possession of an unlocked device.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-SIM-Unlock-your-Android-Device"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-SIM-Unlock-your-Android-Device" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to SIM Unlock your Android Device"></a>Part 2: How to SIM Unlock your Android Device</h2><p>If you find that your SIM is locked, here’s a few things you can do to unlock the Realme 12 5G device.</p><p>Avoid all of the apps on the Google Play Store that promise to unlock your device, most of them don’t work and may even harbour a lot of Trojans and malware that will cause further problems for you and your device.</p><p>There are safe and very legal ways to unlock your device. Just try one of the following.</p><p><strong><em>Ask your Carrier to Unlock your Device</em></strong></p><p>This is the best option when you want to safely unlock your device. By February 2015, American cell phone owners got the option to request their carriers to unlock their device for them. Before that the law didn’t allow for carriers to unlock SIM cards in the United States. This unpopular law was reversed following a similar move by the European Union in 2013. The same law also requires that the carriers inform customers every month whether their device is eligible for unlocking.</p><p>If your device is eligible for unlocking, all you need to do is contact the carrier provide and request for the <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/unlock/unlock-samsung-sim-network-unlock-pin.html" >sim network unlock pin <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. But if your Smartphone was bought on a contract, you may need to pay a termination fee to break the contract of you want to unlock the Realme 12 5G device before the contact term expires. For Smartphones that are not on contract, you have to wait 12 months from the date of purchase and ensure that your bill is paid before the carrier can give you the unlock code.</p><p><strong><em>How to Unlock your Android Phone</em></strong></p><p>To begin with, you need to confirm your IMEI number. Dial *#06# on your device and the IMEI number will appear on the screen. Copy this number to a secure location or wrote it down somewhere.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2016/06/14670084741192.jpg"                      alt="How to Unlock your Android Phone"                ></p><p>The next step is to find a reputable service that will unlock your Android device for you. This is action you should take only if you are absolutely desperate and your carrier can’t unlock your device for you. This is because many of these sites are unregulated and many of them are not reliable.</p><p>You should also know that many of them will charge a certain amount for your service. You can try <a class="link"   href="https://www.safeunlockcode.com/" >https://www.safeunlockcode.com/ <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> which is one of the more reputable ones we have found.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2016/06/14670084936436.jpg"                      alt="android SIM unlock-safeunlockcode"                ></p><p>You will need to enter the IMEI number as part of the information you need to provide before they can unlock your device.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Troubleshooting-Android-SIM-Unlock"><a href="#Part-3-Troubleshooting-Android-SIM-Unlock" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Troubleshooting Android SIM Unlock"></a>Part 3: Troubleshooting Android SIM Unlock</h2><p>There are lots of issues you may face when you try to unlock your device. The following are just some of the troubleshooting actions you can take if you encounter these problems.</p><p><strong><em>Unlocking Code Fails to work</em></strong></p><p>If you asked your carrier to unlock your device for you, chances are that they sent you a code. If the unlocking code fails to work double check that the IMEI number you used is the correct one and ensure that you purchased that device from that carrier and then try again.</p><p><strong><em>Samsung Device Freezes during unlocking</em></strong></p><p>If your device freezes during the unlocking process it typically means that you entered wrong unlocking code too many times. In this case you need to contact the carrier for a Master Code.</p><p><strong><em>My LG device won’t unlock</em></strong></p><p>There are some LG models that cannot be unlocked. These models include LG U300, LG U310, LG U8180, LG U8330, LG U8120, LG U8360, LG U8380, LGU880, and LG U890. If your device is one of these it can’t be unlocked by your carrier. You may need to look into other ways of unlocking your device.</p><h2 id="The-6-Best-SIM-Unlock-Services-That-Actually-Work-On-Your-Realme-12-5G-Device"><a href="#The-6-Best-SIM-Unlock-Services-That-Actually-Work-On-Your-Realme-12-5G-Device" class="headerlink" title="The 6 Best SIM Unlock Services That Actually Work On Your Realme 12 5G Device"></a>The 6 Best SIM Unlock Services That Actually Work On Your Realme 12 5G Device</h2><p>In our ever-connected world, the need for flexibility and freedom in choosing a mobile service provider is more crucial than ever.

Phones are our life source in this global age, it’s our tether to reality, to the world! But if you have a carrier locked phone, then that connection is basically under contract by an external agency! You can’t change your networks, there are limitations on how you use your phone, and when you have to travel abroad you have no option other than paying the roaming charges. If you, say, have an iPhone 5c and have these frustrations, it’s likely you’re already wondering how to unlock the iPhone 5c.</p><p>Chances are that if you’ve had a carrier locked phone for a while, you might have already forgotten what cellular freedom feels like. But we’re here to remind you. All you have to do is break that carrier-lock, and you’re good to go. However, you should be careful when doing so, cause if you try using a jailbreaking technique, it could have major repercussions. So we’re here to give you some valuable advice about how to unlock iPhone 5, iPhone 5c, or even Android phones.</p><h2 id="Part-1-Unlock-SIM-Card-on-Realme-12-5G-via-jailbreak"><a href="#Part-1-Unlock-SIM-Card-on-Realme-12-5G-via-jailbreak" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Unlock SIM Card on Realme 12 5G via jailbreak"></a>Part 1: Unlock SIM Card on Realme 12 5G via jailbreak</h2><p>Before we get into telling you how to unlock iPhone 5, or the SIM Card on iPhone or Android, we should first tell you what Jailbreaking is. You might have heard of this term before, and I’m sure it sounded ominous to you. Jailbreak? It sounds awfully close to ‘Prison break.’ Well, considering the carrier lock is sort of like a prison for your cell, it is an accurate terminology. But Jailbreak isn’t just about breaking the carrier lock. That might happen as a by-product, but the real purpose is to break free of the software restrictions which are generally applied to Apple devices. This might seem like a good option because, well, who doesn’t want to break free of all of Apple’s restrictions? But that always comes at several heavy risks.</p><h3 id="Threats-of-unlocking-SIM-via-Jailbreak"><a href="#Threats-of-unlocking-SIM-via-Jailbreak" class="headerlink" title="Threats of unlocking SIM via Jailbreak"></a>Threats of unlocking SIM via Jailbreak</h3><h4 id="1-Not-Permanent"><a href="#1-Not-Permanent" class="headerlink" title="1. Not Permanent"></a>1. Not Permanent</h4><p>This has got to be one of the biggest reasons for not jailbreaking your phone. It is not at all permanent! In fact, the moment you update your system, your jailbreak is lost and if you’ve started using a different SIM it will no longer function, and you’re gonna have to go back to using that Carrier you tried so hard to escape from! It’s really not worth the effort. Of course, you could stop updating altogether, but then that will bring us to…</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2016/10/14771444107532.jpg"                      alt="Unlock SIM Card on iPhone and Android via jailbreak"                ></p><h4 id="2-Risky"><a href="#2-Risky" class="headerlink" title="2. Risky"></a>2. Risky</h4><p>If you don’t update your iOS, or Mac or iPad or any device at all, in this day and age, you’re basically just asking to be hacked. That is not to excuse those who do the hacking and plant malware on your system, but if you leave your front door open in a shitty neighborhood, well then you only have yourself to blame once you get robbed!</p><h4 id="3-Warranty"><a href="#3-Warranty" class="headerlink" title="3. Warranty"></a>3. Warranty</h4><p>Jailbreaking has now become kind-of-legal, in a very tenuous sense, but that doesn’t mean Apple wholeheartedly welcomes jailbreaking. If you do so, you will never again be able to avail of the warranty on your phone. And with the kind of major bucks you have to shell out for those iPhones, you best keep that warranty intact.</p><h4 id="4-Lack-of-Apps"><a href="#4-Lack-of-Apps" class="headerlink" title="4. Lack of Apps"></a>4. Lack of Apps</h4><p>Many top-notch and crucial app companies and organizations simply refuse to make their applications usable in jailbreak phones, as they are extremely risky and prone to hacking. As a result, you would have to rely on a bunch of non-professional apps made by amateurs, which is more likely to put your phone in harm’s way.</p><h4 id="5-Bricking"><a href="#5-Bricking" class="headerlink" title="5. Bricking"></a>5. Bricking</h4><p>This basically means your whole system may crash and stop functioning. As a result, you’re gonna’ have to restore the whole thing and try to salvage whatever information you can. Now those who do jailbreak regularly will give you all kinds of excuses like it happens only rarely or that you can retrieve your data simply from the cloud, et al. But do you really want to divest all your time and energy trying to fight off malware, backing up all your data, etc, especially when there is a much more convenient option just around the corner?</p><p>Didn’t think so.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-unlock-SIM-Card-on-iPhone-without-jailbreak-Bonus"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-unlock-SIM-Card-on-iPhone-without-jailbreak-Bonus" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to unlock SIM Card on iPhone without jailbreak[Bonus]"></a>Part 2: How to unlock SIM Card on iPhone without jailbreak[Bonus]</h2><p>As mentioned above, unlocking by jailbreaking is risky and only temporary.

Up until a while back, one of the reasons people chose to jailbreak their phones is because the legitimate means was such a headache in which you had to contact the carrier and request a change, and even then they could refuse after several weeks of ‘verification.’ However, now with the slow introduction of apps that can essentially do all the work for you, within a matter of 48 hours, it really makes no sense to jailbreak. So now we’ll tell you how to unlock iPhone 5c using an Online iPhone unlock tool called DoctorSIM Unlock Service.</p><p>SIM Unlock Service is really quite the revolutionary tool which just needs your IMEI code and can do all the work for you and send you the unlock code within a guaranteed period of 48 hours!

Having an unlocked device can have its benefits but most of the time most people don’t even know whether their device is SIM locked or not. In this article we are going to address this issue. We are going to begin by helping you find out whether your phone is locked or not and if it is, how you can <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/unlock-android-screen/" >sim unlock <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> the Realme 11X 5G device and enjoy the benefits of an unlocked phone.</p><h2 id="Part-1-How-to-Know-if-your-Android-is-SIM-Locked"><a href="#Part-1-How-to-Know-if-your-Android-is-SIM-Locked" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: How to Know if your Android is SIM Locked"></a>Part 1: How to Know if your Android is SIM Locked</h2><p>It is important to note that not all phones are SIM locked. You can find out if yours is by checking the Realme 11X 5G device’s documentation. If you see the words “unlocked” on the initial receipt then you know that the Realme 11X 5G device is not SIM locked.</p><p>Another easy way to find out is to ask your carrier if the Realme 11X 5G device is locked on to their network. You can also just try inserting another carrier’s SIM into your device. If it doesn’t work, you will know that the Realme 11X 5G device is SIM locked.</p><p>If you bought your device from a third party re-seller such as Amazon you are more likely to be in possession of an unlocked device.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-SIM-Unlock-your-Android-Device"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-SIM-Unlock-your-Android-Device" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to SIM Unlock your Android Device"></a>Part 2: How to SIM Unlock your Android Device</h2><p>If you find that your SIM is locked, here’s a few things you can do to unlock the Realme 11X 5G device.</p><p>Avoid all of the apps on the Google Play Store that promise to unlock your device, most of them don’t work and may even harbour a lot of Trojans and malware that will cause further problems for you and your device.</p><p>There are safe and very legal ways to unlock your device. Just try one of the following.</p><p><strong><em>Ask your Carrier to Unlock your Device</em></strong></p><p>This is the best option when you want to safely unlock your device. By February 2015, American cell phone owners got the option to request their carriers to unlock their device for them. Before that the law didn’t allow for carriers to unlock SIM cards in the United States. This unpopular law was reversed following a similar move by the European Union in 2013. The same law also requires that the carriers inform customers every month whether their device is eligible for unlocking.</p><p>If your device is eligible for unlocking, all you need to do is contact the carrier provide and request for the <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/unlock/unlock-samsung-sim-network-unlock-pin.html" >sim network unlock pin <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. But if your Smartphone was bought on a contract, you may need to pay a termination fee to break the contract of you want to unlock the Realme 11X 5G device before the contact term expires. For Smartphones that are not on contract, you have to wait 12 months from the date of purchase and ensure that your bill is paid before the carrier can give you the unlock code.</p><p><strong><em>How to Unlock your Android Phone</em></strong></p><p>To begin with, you need to confirm your IMEI number. Dial *#06# on your device and the IMEI number will appear on the screen. Copy this number to a secure location or wrote it down somewhere.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2016/06/14670084741192.jpg"                      alt="How to Unlock your Android Phone"                ></p><p>The next step is to find a reputable service that will unlock your Android device for you. This is action you should take only if you are absolutely desperate and your carrier can’t unlock your device for you. This is because many of these sites are unregulated and many of them are not reliable.</p><p>You should also know that many of them will charge a certain amount for your service. You can try <a class="link"   href="https://www.safeunlockcode.com/" >https://www.safeunlockcode.com/ <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> which is one of the more reputable ones we have found.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2016/06/14670084936436.jpg"                      alt="android SIM unlock-safeunlockcode"                ></p><p>You will need to enter the IMEI number as part of the information you need to provide before they can unlock your device.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Troubleshooting-Android-SIM-Unlock"><a href="#Part-3-Troubleshooting-Android-SIM-Unlock" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Troubleshooting Android SIM Unlock"></a>Part 3: Troubleshooting Android SIM Unlock</h2><p>There are lots of issues you may face when you try to unlock your device. The following are just some of the troubleshooting actions you can take if you encounter these problems.</p><p><strong><em>Unlocking Code Fails to work</em></strong></p><p>If you asked your carrier to unlock your device for you, chances are that they sent you a code. If the unlocking code fails to work double check that the IMEI number you used is the correct one and ensure that you purchased that device from that carrier and then try again.</p><p><strong><em>Samsung Device Freezes during unlocking</em></strong></p><p>If your device freezes during the unlocking process it typically means that you entered wrong unlocking code too many times. In this case you need to contact the carrier for a Master Code.</p><p><strong><em>My LG device won’t unlock</em></strong></p><p>There are some LG models that cannot be unlocked. These models include LG U300, LG U310, LG U8180, LG U8330, LG U8120, LG U8360, LG U8380, LGU880, and LG U890. If your device is one of these it can’t be unlocked by your carrier. You may need to look into other ways of unlocking your device.</p><h2 id="Top-3-Sites-to-Find-Free-Realme-Unlock-Codes-to-Unlock-Your-Realme-Phone"><a href="#Top-3-Sites-to-Find-Free-Realme-Unlock-Codes-to-Unlock-Your-Realme-Phone" class="headerlink" title="Top 3 Sites to Find Free Realme Unlock Codes to Unlock Your Realme Phone"></a>Top 3 Sites to Find Free Realme Unlock Codes to Unlock Your Realme Phone</h2><p><a href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/author/selena-lee/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://drfone.wondershare.com/images/selena-lee.png"                      alt="Selena Lee"                ></a></p><p>It is really irritating when you realize that Realme 11X 5G phone is locked to a specific network.

Having an unlocked device can have its benefits but most of the time most people don’t even know whether their device is SIM locked or not. In this article we are going to address this issue. We are going to begin by helping you find out whether your phone is locked or not and if it is, how you can <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/unlock-android-screen/" >sim unlock <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> the Realme 11 Pro+ device and enjoy the benefits of an unlocked phone.</p><h2 id="Part-1-How-to-Know-if-your-Android-is-SIM-Locked"><a href="#Part-1-How-to-Know-if-your-Android-is-SIM-Locked" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: How to Know if your Android is SIM Locked"></a>Part 1: How to Know if your Android is SIM Locked</h2><p>It is important to note that not all phones are SIM locked. You can find out if yours is by checking the Realme 11 Pro+ device’s documentation. If you see the words “unlocked” on the initial receipt then you know that the Realme 11 Pro+ device is not SIM locked.</p><p>Another easy way to find out is to ask your carrier if the Realme 11 Pro+ device is locked on to their network. You can also just try inserting another carrier’s SIM into your device. If it doesn’t work, you will know that the Realme 11 Pro+ device is SIM locked.</p><p>If you bought your device from a third party re-seller such as Amazon you are more likely to be in possession of an unlocked device.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-SIM-Unlock-your-Android-Device"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-SIM-Unlock-your-Android-Device" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to SIM Unlock your Android Device"></a>Part 2: How to SIM Unlock your Android Device</h2><p>If you find that your SIM is locked, here’s a few things you can do to unlock the Realme 11 Pro+ device.</p><p>Avoid all of the apps on the Google Play Store that promise to unlock your device, most of them don’t work and may even harbour a lot of Trojans and malware that will cause further problems for you and your device.</p><p>There are safe and very legal ways to unlock your device. Just try one of the following.</p><p><strong><em>Ask your Carrier to Unlock your Device</em></strong></p><p>This is the best option when you want to safely unlock your device. By February 2015, American cell phone owners got the option to request their carriers to unlock their device for them. Before that the law didn’t allow for carriers to unlock SIM cards in the United States. This unpopular law was reversed following a similar move by the European Union in 2013. The same law also requires that the carriers inform customers every month whether their device is eligible for unlocking.</p><p>If your device is eligible for unlocking, all you need to do is contact the carrier provide and request for the <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/unlock/unlock-samsung-sim-network-unlock-pin.html" >sim network unlock pin <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. But if your Smartphone was bought on a contract, you may need to pay a termination fee to break the contract of you want to unlock the Realme 11 Pro+ device before the contact term expires. For Smartphones that are not on contract, you have to wait 12 months from the date of purchase and ensure that your bill is paid before the carrier can give you the unlock code.</p><p><strong><em>How to Unlock your Android Phone</em></strong></p><p>To begin with, you need to confirm your IMEI number. Dial *#06# on your device and the IMEI number will appear on the screen. Copy this number to a secure location or wrote it down somewhere.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2016/06/14670084741192.jpg"                      alt="How to Unlock your Android Phone"                ></p><p>The next step is to find a reputable service that will unlock your Android device for you. This is action you should take only if you are absolutely desperate and your carrier can’t unlock your device for you. This is because many of these sites are unregulated and many of them are not reliable.</p><p>You should also know that many of them will charge a certain amount for your service. You can try <a class="link"   href="https://www.safeunlockcode.com/" >https://www.safeunlockcode.com/ <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> which is one of the more reputable ones we have found.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2016/06/14670084936436.jpg"                      alt="android SIM unlock-safeunlockcode"                ></p><p>You will need to enter the IMEI number as part of the information you need to provide before they can unlock your device.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Troubleshooting-Android-SIM-Unlock"><a href="#Part-3-Troubleshooting-Android-SIM-Unlock" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Troubleshooting Android SIM Unlock"></a>Part 3: Troubleshooting Android SIM Unlock</h2><p>There are lots of issues you may face when you try to unlock your device. The following are just some of the troubleshooting actions you can take if you encounter these problems.</p><p><strong><em>Unlocking Code Fails to work</em></strong></p><p>If you asked your carrier to unlock your device for you, chances are that they sent you a code. If the unlocking code fails to work double check that the IMEI number you used is the correct one and ensure that you purchased that device from that carrier and then try again.</p><p><strong><em>Samsung Device Freezes during unlocking</em></strong></p><p>If your device freezes during the unlocking process it typically means that you entered wrong unlocking code too many times. In this case you need to contact the carrier for a Master Code.</p><p><strong><em>My LG device won’t unlock</em></strong></p><p>There are some LG models that cannot be unlocked. These models include LG U300, LG U310, LG U8180, LG U8330, LG U8120, LG U8360, LG U8380, LGU880, and LG U890. If your device is one of these it can’t be unlocked by your carrier. You may need to look into other ways of unlocking your device.</p><h2 id="How-To-Unlock-SIM-Cards-Of-Realme-11-Pro-Without-PUK-Codes"><a href="#How-To-Unlock-SIM-Cards-Of-Realme-11-Pro-Without-PUK-Codes" class="headerlink" title="How To Unlock SIM Cards Of Realme 11 Pro+ Without PUK Codes"></a>How To Unlock SIM Cards Of Realme 11 Pro+ Without PUK Codes</h2><p>Unintentionally locking your SIM card with an incorrect PIN is a common occurrence. It’s frustrating because it prevents you from accessing your essential mobile services. Thankfully, Personal Unblocking Key (PUK) codes offer a way to unlock it. However, what happens if you lose them?</p><p>This comprehensive guide explores <strong>how to unlock SIM cards without the PUK Codes</strong>. Whether you’re a techie or a tech noob, you’ll be sure to find easy solutions in this article. From directly contacting your mobile carrier to utilizing alternative unlocking techniques, you will see clear and concise instructions that empower you to navigate this technical hurdle.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/02/unlock-sim-without-puk-code-01.jpg"                      alt="back of sim packaging puk code"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-Official-Ways-To-Unlock-SIM-Cards-With-a-Lost-PUK-Code"><a href="#Part-1-Official-Ways-To-Unlock-SIM-Cards-With-a-Lost-PUK-Code" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Official Ways To Unlock SIM Cards With a Lost PUK Code"></a>Part 1: Official Ways To Unlock SIM Cards With a Lost PUK Code</h2><p>Locking your SIM card with a forgotten PIN can be a frustrating experience, especially when your trusty PUK code seems to have vanished. While unauthorized methods exist to unlock your SIM card, venturing down that path can lead to complications and potential security risks. This guide prioritizes safe and official methods, ensuring a smooth and secure unlocking process with the help of your mobile carrier.</p><p>Firstly, remember that the PUK code typically arrives alongside your SIM card in its original packaging. Keeping this information safe alongside your other crucial documents is always helpful. However, if memory betrays you and the packaging is nowhere to be found, this part will show you <strong>how to unlock SIM cards without PUK codes</strong> with the help of your carrier.</p><h3 id="Method-1-Contacting-Your-Carrier’s-Customer-Service"><a href="#Method-1-Contacting-Your-Carrier’s-Customer-Service" class="headerlink" title="Method 1: Contacting Your Carrier’s Customer Service"></a>Method 1: Contacting Your Carrier’s Customer Service</h3><p>The most straightforward approach is contacting your mobile carrier’s customer service department directly. Their representatives are trained to assist in such situations and can verify your identity before providing the PUK code. Be prepared to answer security questions and provide relevant account details to ensure a smooth process.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/02/unlock-sim-without-puk-code-02.jpg"                      alt="customer service"                ></p><p>Here’s what you’ll need:</p><ul><li><strong>Ready your information.</strong> Prepare your account number, phone number, and any other relevant details your carrier might require for verification.</li><li><strong>Find the best contact option for you.</strong> Most carriers offer multiple options like phone calls, online chat, or visiting a physical store.

They might offer you a replaced SIM card if no PUK codes exist.</li><li>**Unlock your SIM card.**Enter the PUK code on your phone following the specific instructions provided by your carrier. This typically involves entering the PUK code followed by a new PIN.</li></ul><h3 id="Method-2-Retrieving-the-PUK-Code-Through-Your-Carrier’s-Website"><a href="#Method-2-Retrieving-the-PUK-Code-Through-Your-Carrier’s-Website" class="headerlink" title="Method 2: Retrieving the PUK Code Through Your Carrier’s Website"></a>Method 2: Retrieving the PUK Code Through Your Carrier’s Website</h3><p>Many mobile carriers offer self-service options on their websites, allowing you to manage your account and access information independently. If your carrier provides this functionality, you can retrieve your PUK code online without contacting customer service. This way, you’ll learn <strong>how to unlock SIM cards without PUK numbers</strong>.</p><p>Here’s how it might work:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Navigate to the secure section of your account using your login credentials.

Having an unlocked device can have its benefits but most of the time most people don’t even know whether their device is SIM locked or not. In this article we are going to address this issue. We are going to begin by helping you find out whether your phone is locked or not and if it is, how you can <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/unlock-android-screen/" >sim unlock <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> the Realme 11 Pro device and enjoy the benefits of an unlocked phone.</p><h2 id="Part-1-How-to-Know-if-your-Android-is-SIM-Locked"><a href="#Part-1-How-to-Know-if-your-Android-is-SIM-Locked" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: How to Know if your Android is SIM Locked"></a>Part 1: How to Know if your Android is SIM Locked</h2><p>It is important to note that not all phones are SIM locked. You can find out if yours is by checking the Realme 11 Pro device’s documentation. If you see the words “unlocked” on the initial receipt then you know that the Realme 11 Pro device is not SIM locked.</p><p>Another easy way to find out is to ask your carrier if the Realme 11 Pro device is locked on to their network. You can also just try inserting another carrier’s SIM into your device. If it doesn’t work, you will know that the Realme 11 Pro device is SIM locked.</p><p>If you bought your device from a third party re-seller such as Amazon you are more likely to be in possession of an unlocked device.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-SIM-Unlock-your-Android-Device"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-SIM-Unlock-your-Android-Device" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to SIM Unlock your Android Device"></a>Part 2: How to SIM Unlock your Android Device</h2><p>If you find that your SIM is locked, here’s a few things you can do to unlock the Realme 11 Pro device.</p><p>Avoid all of the apps on the Google Play Store that promise to unlock your device, most of them don’t work and may even harbour a lot of Trojans and malware that will cause further problems for you and your device.</p><p>There are safe and very legal ways to unlock your device. Just try one of the following.</p><p><strong><em>Ask your Carrier to Unlock your Device</em></strong></p><p>This is the best option when you want to safely unlock your device. By February 2015, American cell phone owners got the option to request their carriers to unlock their device for them. Before that the law didn’t allow for carriers to unlock SIM cards in the United States. This unpopular law was reversed following a similar move by the European Union in 2013. The same law also requires that the carriers inform customers every month whether their device is eligible for unlocking.</p><p>If your device is eligible for unlocking, all you need to do is contact the carrier provide and request for the <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/unlock/unlock-samsung-sim-network-unlock-pin.html" >sim network unlock pin <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. But if your Smartphone was bought on a contract, you may need to pay a termination fee to break the contract of you want to unlock the Realme 11 Pro device before the contact term expires. For Smartphones that are not on contract, you have to wait 12 months from the date of purchase and ensure that your bill is paid before the carrier can give you the unlock code.</p><p><strong><em>How to Unlock your Android Phone</em></strong></p><p>To begin with, you need to confirm your IMEI number. Dial *#06# on your device and the IMEI number will appear on the screen. Copy this number to a secure location or wrote it down somewhere.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2016/06/14670084741192.jpg"                      alt="How to Unlock your Android Phone"                ></p><p>The next step is to find a reputable service that will unlock your Android device for you. This is action you should take only if you are absolutely desperate and your carrier can’t unlock your device for you. This is because many of these sites are unregulated and many of them are not reliable.</p><p>You should also know that many of them will charge a certain amount for your service. You can try <a class="link"   href="https://www.safeunlockcode.com/" >https://www.safeunlockcode.com/ <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> which is one of the more reputable ones we have found.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2016/06/14670084936436.jpg"                      alt="android SIM unlock-safeunlockcode"                ></p><p>You will need to enter the IMEI number as part of the information you need to provide before they can unlock your device.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Troubleshooting-Android-SIM-Unlock"><a href="#Part-3-Troubleshooting-Android-SIM-Unlock" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Troubleshooting Android SIM Unlock"></a>Part 3: Troubleshooting Android SIM Unlock</h2><p>There are lots of issues you may face when you try to unlock your device. The following are just some of the troubleshooting actions you can take if you encounter these problems.</p><p><strong><em>Unlocking Code Fails to work</em></strong></p><p>If you asked your carrier to unlock your device for you, chances are that they sent you a code. If the unlocking code fails to work double check that the IMEI number you used is the correct one and ensure that you purchased that device from that carrier and then try again.</p><p><strong><em>Samsung Device Freezes during unlocking</em></strong></p><p>If your device freezes during the unlocking process it typically means that you entered wrong unlocking code too many times. In this case you need to contact the carrier for a Master Code.</p><p><strong><em>My LG device won’t unlock</em></strong></p><p>There are some LG models that cannot be unlocked. These models include LG U300, LG U310, LG U8180, LG U8330, LG U8120, LG U8360, LG U8380, LGU880, and LG U890. If your device is one of these it can’t be unlocked by your carrier. You may need to look into other ways of unlocking your device.</p><h2 id="What-Is-a-SIM-Network-Unlock-PIN-Get-Your-Realme-11-Pro-Phone-Network-Ready"><a href="#What-Is-a-SIM-Network-Unlock-PIN-Get-Your-Realme-11-Pro-Phone-Network-Ready" class="headerlink" title="What Is a SIM Network Unlock PIN?

Get Your Realme 11 Pro Phone Network-Ready</h2><p>A network-locked device tethers you to one carrier, limiting your choices. You might miss out on better deals, struggle with roaming charges abroad, or feel inconvenienced by limited coverage. And you can’t avoid these things without the right <strong>SIM network unlock PIN</strong>.</p><p>That’s why we’ve created this comprehensive guide to help you unlock your phone’s potential. This article will explain what a <strong>SIM network unlock PIN</strong> is, the process involved, and answer any questions you might have. Keep scrolling to learn more.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/02/sim-network-unlock-pin-01.jpg"                      alt="enter sim network unlock pin"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-Why-Is-Your-Realme-11-Pro-Asking-for-a-SIM-Network-Unlock-PIN"><a href="#Part-1-Why-Is-Your-Realme-11-Pro-Asking-for-a-SIM-Network-Unlock-PIN" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Why Is Your Realme 11 Pro Asking for a SIM Network Unlock PIN?"></a>Part 1: Why Is Your Realme 11 Pro Asking for a SIM Network Unlock PIN?</h2><p>You just bought a new phone, excited to use it with a new SIM card. But your phone pops up with a request for a PIN code to unlock it. What’s that all about, and what do you enter? There are two main reasons why your phone might be asking for a SIM PIN or unlock code:</p><p>SIM Network Lock</p><p>The SIM Network Lock is a restriction placed by your phone’s original network provider, locking it to their network. It means you can only use the Realme 11 Pro device with SIM cards from that specific carrier. Carriers use this to ensure that the phones they sell work only with their service. When you buy a subsidized phone, they want to ensure you stick around for the contract duration.</p><p>If you insert a SIM card from a different carrier, your phone will ask for a <strong>SIM Network Unlock PIN</strong> or Network Unlock Code (NUC). You’ll learn more about it in the upcoming sections of this article.</p><p>SIM Card Lock</p><p>SIM Card Lock is a security feature that protects your SIM card from unauthorized use on other devices. It requires you to enter a PIN (Personal Identification Number) to unlock the SIM card before you can use it.</p><p>The default PIN is usually printed on the back of the SIM card or its packaging. If you haven’t changed your PIN, use the 4-8 digit code provided by the carrier when you get your SIM card.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/02/sim-network-unlock-pin-02.jpg"                      alt="sim card lock pin"                ></p><p>If you’ve forgotten the <strong>SIM PIN code</strong>, you can use the PUK (PIN Unlock Key) code to unlock the SIM and set a new PIN. The PUK code is also printed on the SIM card packaging, but be careful, as entering the wrong PUK code too many times can permanently lock the SIM card.</p><p>Not knowing the <strong>SIM unlock PIN</strong> code can be frustrating, especially if you want to switch mobile carriers.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Easily-Unlock-Your-Realme-11-5G-Device-SIM"><a href="#Easily-Unlock-Your-Realme-11-5G-Device-SIM" class="headerlink" title="Easily Unlock Your Realme 11 5G Device SIM"></a>Easily Unlock Your Realme 11 5G Device SIM</h2><p>Is your Android phone SIM locked? Having an unlocked device can have its benefits but most of the time most people don’t even know whether their device is SIM locked or not. In this article we are going to address this issue. We are going to begin by helping you find out whether your phone is locked or not and if it is, how you can <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/unlock-android-screen/" >sim unlock <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> the Realme 11 5G device and enjoy the benefits of an unlocked phone.</p><h2 id="Part-1-How-to-Know-if-your-Android-is-SIM-Locked"><a href="#Part-1-How-to-Know-if-your-Android-is-SIM-Locked" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: How to Know if your Android is SIM Locked"></a>Part 1: How to Know if your Android is SIM Locked</h2><p>It is important to note that not all phones are SIM locked. You can find out if yours is by checking the Realme 11 5G device’s documentation. If you see the words “unlocked” on the initial receipt then you know that the Realme 11 5G device is not SIM locked.</p><p>Another easy way to find out is to ask your carrier if the Realme 11 5G device is locked on to their network. You can also just try inserting another carrier’s SIM into your device. If it doesn’t work, you will know that the Realme 11 5G device is SIM locked.</p><p>If you bought your device from a third party re-seller such as Amazon you are more likely to be in possession of an unlocked device.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-SIM-Unlock-your-Android-Device"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-SIM-Unlock-your-Android-Device" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to SIM Unlock your Android Device"></a>Part 2: How to SIM Unlock your Android Device</h2><p>If you find that your SIM is locked, here’s a few things you can do to unlock the Realme 11 5G device.</p><p>Avoid all of the apps on the Google Play Store that promise to unlock your device, most of them don’t work and may even harbour a lot of Trojans and malware that will cause further problems for you and your device.</p><p>There are safe and very legal ways to unlock your device. Just try one of the following.</p><p><strong><em>Ask your Carrier to Unlock your Device</em></strong></p><p>This is the best option when you want to safely unlock your device. By February 2015, American cell phone owners got the option to request their carriers to unlock their device for them. Before that the law didn’t allow for carriers to unlock SIM cards in the United States. This unpopular law was reversed following a similar move by the European Union in 2013. The same law also requires that the carriers inform customers every month whether their device is eligible for unlocking.</p><p>If your device is eligible for unlocking, all you need to do is contact the carrier provide and request for the <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/unlock/unlock-samsung-sim-network-unlock-pin.html" >sim network unlock pin <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. But if your Smartphone was bought on a contract, you may need to pay a termination fee to break the contract of you want to unlock the Realme 11 5G device before the contact term expires. For Smartphones that are not on contract, you have to wait 12 months from the date of purchase and ensure that your bill is paid before the carrier can give you the unlock code.</p><p><strong><em>How to Unlock your Android Phone</em></strong></p><p>To begin with, you need to confirm your IMEI number. Dial *#06# on your device and the IMEI number will appear on the screen. Copy this number to a secure location or wrote it down somewhere.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2016/06/14670084741192.jpg"                      alt="How to Unlock your Android Phone"                ></p><p>The next step is to find a reputable service that will unlock your Android device for you. This is action you should take only if you are absolutely desperate and your carrier can’t unlock your device for you. This is because many of these sites are unregulated and many of them are not reliable.</p><p>You should also know that many of them will charge a certain amount for your service. You can try <a class="link"   href="https://www.safeunlockcode.com/" >https://www.safeunlockcode.com/ <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> which is one of the more reputable ones we have found.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2016/06/14670084936436.jpg"                      alt="android SIM unlock-safeunlockcode"                ></p><p>You will need to enter the IMEI number as part of the information you need to provide before they can unlock your device.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Troubleshooting-Android-SIM-Unlock"><a href="#Part-3-Troubleshooting-Android-SIM-Unlock" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Troubleshooting Android SIM Unlock"></a>Part 3: Troubleshooting Android SIM Unlock</h2><p>There are lots of issues you may face when you try to unlock your device. The following are just some of the troubleshooting actions you can take if you encounter these problems.</p><p><strong><em>Unlocking Code Fails to work</em></strong></p><p>If you asked your carrier to unlock your device for you, chances are that they sent you a code. If the unlocking code fails to work double check that the IMEI number you used is the correct one and ensure that you purchased that device from that carrier and then try again.</p><p><strong><em>Samsung Device Freezes during unlocking</em></strong></p><p>If your device freezes during the unlocking process it typically means that you entered wrong unlocking code too many times. In this case you need to contact the carrier for a Master Code.</p><p><strong><em>My LG device won’t unlock</em></strong></p><p>There are some LG models that cannot be unlocked. These models include LG U300, LG U310, LG U8180, LG U8330, LG U8120, LG U8360, LG U8380, LGU880, and LG U890. If your device is one of these it can’t be unlocked by your carrier. You may need to look into other ways of unlocking your device.</p><h2 id="Ways-To-Find-Unlocking-Codes-For-Realme-11-5G-Phones"><a href="#Ways-To-Find-Unlocking-Codes-For-Realme-11-5G-Phones" class="headerlink" title="Ways To Find Unlocking Codes For Realme 11 5G Phones"></a>Ways To Find Unlocking Codes For Realme 11 5G Phones</h2><p>When you have a locked device, it is pretty much impossible to move from one network to another. This would cause problems if for instance you wanted to travel outside the country and want to switch to that country’s carrier for the duration of your stay.

This 4-digit code protects your phone number from unauthorized calls, texts, and data use. It’s essential to change the default PIN to one that’s both memorable for you and difficult for others to guess.</p><p>So, <strong>how to change the PIN on an Android phone</strong>’s SIM card? This article will provide a step-by-step guide to help you secure your data. But first, let’s explore why changing the default one is important.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/02/how-to-change-pin-on-android-phone-01.jpg"                      alt="a phone sim card"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-Why-Does-Changing-Your-SIM-PIN-Code-Matter-on-a-New-Phone"><a href="#Part-1-Why-Does-Changing-Your-SIM-PIN-Code-Matter-on-a-New-Phone" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Why Does Changing Your SIM PIN Code Matter on a New Phone?"></a>Part 1: Why Does Changing Your SIM PIN Code Matter on a New Phone?</h2><p>Your SIM PIN code acts as a password for your SIM card, which stores your phone number, contacts, and other essential data. Unlike the PIN you use to unlock your phone, the SIM PIN code is a separate layer of security. If someone tries to use your SIM card in another phone without the correct PIN, they won’t be able to access your network or data.</p><p>Here are more reasons why <strong>changing the PIN code of a SIM card</strong> is a smart move:</p><ul><li>Default PINs are easy to guess</li></ul><p>Most carriers use generic PINs like “1234” or “0000”. Change it to something unique and harder to crack.</p><ul><li>Protects data in case of loss or theft</li></ul><p>If you lose your phone or it gets stolen, a strong PIN code hinders the thief’s ability to make calls, send messages, or access your data stored on the SIM. It buys you time to report the loss and block your SIM card before they can do any damage.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/02/how-to-change-pin-on-android-phone-02.jpg"                      alt="sim card locked"                ></p><ul><li>Prevents accidental PIN lockouts</li></ul><p>Using a memorable PIN minimizes the risk of accidentally locking yourself out of your SIM card.</p><ul><li>Peace of mind</li></ul><p>It is crucial if you store sensitive info on your SIM or use your phone for work. Knowing about this extra safeguard is reassuring, ensuring your data stays protected.</p><p><strong>Remember:</strong></p><p>Choose a PIN code for your SIM that’s easy for you to remember but challenging for others to guess. Avoid using birthdays, anniversaries, or other easily identifiable information. By taking a few minutes to <strong>change the PIN code of the SIM card</strong>, you’ll gain a significant security advantage for your new phone and data.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-To-Change-Pin-on-Android-Phone-SIM-Cards"><a href="#Part-2-How-To-Change-Pin-on-Android-Phone-SIM-Cards" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How To Change Pin on Android Phone SIM Cards?"></a>Part 2: How To Change Pin on Android Phone SIM Cards?</h2><p>Keeping your SIM card secure is crucial for protecting your data and privacy. Thankfully, Android allows you to easily change your SIM card PIN to a more personal and memorable code. But before you begin:</p><ul><li>Contact your network carrier to get your PUK code if you already have it. You’ll need this if you enter the wrong PIN three times and lock your SIM card.</li><li>Remember the temporary default PIN: Most SIM cards have a default PIN, often 1234 or 0123. If you haven’t changed it, this is the PIN you’ll use initially.</li></ul><p><strong>Note:</strong></p><p>Entering the wrong PIN three times will lock your SIM card. You’ll need your network carrier’s PUK code to unlock it. Use it cautiously, as exceeding the maximum number of attempts will permanently block your SIM card. So, it’s best to memorize your PIN or store it securely to avoid relying on the PUK altogether.</p><p>Steps To Change Your SIM PIN</p><p>Here’s <strong>how to find and manage the SIM PIN code on Android</strong>:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Navigate to your phone’s <strong>Settings</strong> app. Next, look for the <strong>Security and privacy</strong> or <strong>Lock screen and security</strong> (or other similar option) depending on your device’s model.</li><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Scroll down and tap on <strong>More security settings</strong> or <strong>Other security settings</strong>.</li><li><strong>Step 3:</strong> Tap <strong>SIM card security</strong> or <strong>Set up SIM card lock</strong> (or something similar).</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/02/how-to-change-pin-on-android-phone-03.jpg"                      alt="sim card security in settings"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Step 4:</strong> If you have multiple SIMs, select the one you want to change the PIN code.</li><li><strong>Step 5:</strong> Tap <strong>Change SIM PIN</strong>.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/02/how-to-change-pin-on-android-phone-04.jpg"                      alt="change sim pin code on android"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Step 6:</strong> Input your current SIM card PIN code and tap <strong>OK</strong>.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/02/how-to-change-pin-on-android-phone-05.jpg"                      alt="enter old sim pin"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Step 7:</strong> Enter your desired new PIN code and tap <strong>OK</strong>.</li><li><strong>Step 8:</strong> Re-enter your new SIM card PIN code and tap <strong>OK</strong> to confirm.</li></ul><p>Success!

Having an unlocked device can have its benefits but most of the time most people don’t even know whether their device is SIM locked or not. In this article we are going to address this issue. We are going to begin by helping you find out whether your phone is locked or not and if it is, how you can <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/unlock-android-screen/" >sim unlock <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> the Realme 10T 5G device and enjoy the benefits of an unlocked phone.</p><h2 id="Part-1-How-to-Know-if-your-Android-is-SIM-Locked"><a href="#Part-1-How-to-Know-if-your-Android-is-SIM-Locked" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: How to Know if your Android is SIM Locked"></a>Part 1: How to Know if your Android is SIM Locked</h2><p>It is important to note that not all phones are SIM locked. You can find out if yours is by checking the Realme 10T 5G device’s documentation. If you see the words “unlocked” on the initial receipt then you know that the Realme 10T 5G device is not SIM locked.</p><p>Another easy way to find out is to ask your carrier if the Realme 10T 5G device is locked on to their network. You can also just try inserting another carrier’s SIM into your device. If it doesn’t work, you will know that the Realme 10T 5G device is SIM locked.</p><p>If you bought your device from a third party re-seller such as Amazon you are more likely to be in possession of an unlocked device.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-SIM-Unlock-your-Android-Device"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-SIM-Unlock-your-Android-Device" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to SIM Unlock your Android Device"></a>Part 2: How to SIM Unlock your Android Device</h2><p>If you find that your SIM is locked, here’s a few things you can do to unlock the Realme 10T 5G device.</p><p>Avoid all of the apps on the Google Play Store that promise to unlock your device, most of them don’t work and may even harbour a lot of Trojans and malware that will cause further problems for you and your device.</p><p>There are safe and very legal ways to unlock your device. Just try one of the following.</p><p><strong><em>Ask your Carrier to Unlock your Device</em></strong></p><p>This is the best option when you want to safely unlock your device. By February 2015, American cell phone owners got the option to request their carriers to unlock their device for them. Before that the law didn’t allow for carriers to unlock SIM cards in the United States. This unpopular law was reversed following a similar move by the European Union in 2013. The same law also requires that the carriers inform customers every month whether their device is eligible for unlocking.</p><p>If your device is eligible for unlocking, all you need to do is contact the carrier provide and request for the <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/unlock/unlock-samsung-sim-network-unlock-pin.html" >sim network unlock pin <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. But if your Smartphone was bought on a contract, you may need to pay a termination fee to break the contract of you want to unlock the Realme 10T 5G device before the contact term expires. For Smartphones that are not on contract, you have to wait 12 months from the date of purchase and ensure that your bill is paid before the carrier can give you the unlock code.</p><p><strong><em>How to Unlock your Android Phone</em></strong></p><p>To begin with, you need to confirm your IMEI number. Dial *#06# on your device and the IMEI number will appear on the screen. Copy this number to a secure location or wrote it down somewhere.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2016/06/14670084741192.jpg"                      alt="How to Unlock your Android Phone"                ></p><p>The next step is to find a reputable service that will unlock your Android device for you. This is action you should take only if you are absolutely desperate and your carrier can’t unlock your device for you. This is because many of these sites are unregulated and many of them are not reliable.</p><p>You should also know that many of them will charge a certain amount for your service. You can try <a class="link"   href="https://www.safeunlockcode.com/" >https://www.safeunlockcode.com/ <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> which is one of the more reputable ones we have found.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2016/06/14670084936436.jpg"                      alt="android SIM unlock-safeunlockcode"                ></p><p>You will need to enter the IMEI number as part of the information you need to provide before they can unlock your device.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Troubleshooting-Android-SIM-Unlock"><a href="#Part-3-Troubleshooting-Android-SIM-Unlock" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Troubleshooting Android SIM Unlock"></a>Part 3: Troubleshooting Android SIM Unlock</h2><p>There are lots of issues you may face when you try to unlock your device. The following are just some of the troubleshooting actions you can take if you encounter these problems.</p><p><strong><em>Unlocking Code Fails to work</em></strong></p><p>If you asked your carrier to unlock your device for you, chances are that they sent you a code. If the unlocking code fails to work double check that the IMEI number you used is the correct one and ensure that you purchased that device from that carrier and then try again.</p><p><strong><em>Samsung Device Freezes during unlocking</em></strong></p><p>If your device freezes during the unlocking process it typically means that you entered wrong unlocking code too many times. In this case you need to contact the carrier for a Master Code.</p><p><strong><em>My LG device won’t unlock</em></strong></p><p>There are some LG models that cannot be unlocked. These models include LG U300, LG U310, LG U8180, LG U8330, LG U8120, LG U8360, LG U8380, LGU880, and LG U890. If your device is one of these it can’t be unlocked by your carrier. You may need to look into other ways of unlocking your device.</p><h2 id="What-Does-‘Enter-PUK-Code’-Mean-And-Why-Did-The-Sim-Get-PUK-Blocked-On-Realme-10T-5G-Device"><a href="#What-Does-‘Enter-PUK-Code’-Mean-And-Why-Did-The-Sim-Get-PUK-Blocked-On-Realme-10T-5G-Device" class="headerlink" title="What Does ‘Enter PUK Code’ Mean And Why Did The Sim Get PUK Blocked On Realme 10T 5G Device"></a>What Does ‘Enter PUK Code’ Mean And Why Did The Sim Get PUK Blocked On Realme 10T 5G Device</h2><p>If your SIM card is disabled, you probably entered the incorrect PIN code too frequently. Your SIM locks itself after three to five wrong inputs, on average. Although it might be annoying, doing these guards against unauthorized access to your phone and personal data. If your cell phone is lost or stolen, PUK blocked will prevent prospective hackers from making calls.</p><p>Your mobile phone display can say “PIN blocked” or “Enter PUK code.” PUK stands for PIN Unblocking Key in the PUK code. The PUK code is seldom given to you when you receive your membership in the US. Contact Your Realme 10T 5G provider’s customer support if you don’t know your PUK code.</p><h2 id="Part-1-Why-Was-My-Sim-Card-Blocked"><a href="#Part-1-Why-Was-My-Sim-Card-Blocked" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Why Was My Sim Card Blocked?"></a>Part 1: Why Was My Sim Card Blocked?</h2><h3 id="1-3-times-incorrect-Pin-entered"><a href="#1-3-times-incorrect-Pin-entered" class="headerlink" title="1. 3 times incorrect Pin entered"></a>1. 3 times incorrect Pin entered</h3><p>Sometimes when you forget your pin and keep on entering the wrong one, you can get PUK Blocked. You can utilize three to five chances, and your sim gets blocked when you enter the incorrect pin in all of these attempts.</p><h3 id="2-Wrong-PUK-code-entered"><a href="#2-Wrong-PUK-code-entered" class="headerlink" title="2. Wrong PUK code entered"></a>2. Wrong PUK code entered</h3><p>Sims are frequently blocked; therefore, if you have your PUK, keep it in a secure location separate from your phone. This is because it is the key to unlocking your SIM. The SIM will be permanently disabled, and you will have to buy a new SIM card if you input the wrong PUK ten times in a row.</p><h2 id="Part-2-What-To-Do-When-I-Blocked-My-Sim-Card"><a href="#Part-2-What-To-Do-When-I-Blocked-My-Sim-Card" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: What To Do When I Blocked My Sim Card?"></a>Part 2: What To Do When I Blocked My Sim Card?</h2><p>Your SIM card has been disabled to protect your security if you enter three wrong PINs and your phone shows “SIM card banned” or “Enter PUK code”.</p><p>You must input a PUK (PIN Unlock Key) code to unlock your SIM card.</p><p>Go to your phone’s settings to customize your PIN code after using a PUK code to unlock your SIM card. Pick a PIN that is simple to remember.</p><p>If your PUK code was delivered to you by email:</p><p>You got an email with multiple codes, including PUK1, PIN2, and PUK2.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/10/how-to-unlock-puk-blocked-sim-card-1.jpg"                      alt="go to settings and customize to unblock sim"                ></p><p>If your PIN is locked, use PUK1 to unlock it.</p><p>Only a few phones employ PIN2 and PUK2 codes to restrict access to certain SIM card functionalities.</p><p>PIN2: The default code for your SIM card; If this code has been altered, use the PUK2 code to restore it.</p><p>PUK2: Your PIN2’s unlock code if it has been blocked.</p><h2 id="Part-3-How-Can-I-Have-My-PUK-Code-To-Unlock-Sim-Card"><a href="#Part-3-How-Can-I-Have-My-PUK-Code-To-Unlock-Sim-Card" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How Can I Have My PUK Code To Unlock Sim Card?"></a>Part 3: How Can I Have My PUK Code To Unlock Sim Card?</h2><h3 id="1-Get-it-from-sim-card-packaging"><a href="#1-Get-it-from-sim-card-packaging" class="headerlink" title="1.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Easily-Unlock-Your-Poco-X6-Pro-Device-SIM"><a href="#Easily-Unlock-Your-Poco-X6-Pro-Device-SIM" class="headerlink" title="Easily Unlock Your Poco X6 Pro Device SIM"></a>Easily Unlock Your Poco X6 Pro Device SIM</h2><p>Is your Android phone SIM locked? Having an unlocked device can have its benefits but most of the time most people don’t even know whether their device is SIM locked or not. In this article we are going to address this issue. We are going to begin by helping you find out whether your phone is locked or not and if it is, how you can <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/unlock-android-screen/" >sim unlock <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> the Poco X6 Pro device and enjoy the benefits of an unlocked phone.</p><h2 id="Part-1-How-to-Know-if-your-Android-is-SIM-Locked"><a href="#Part-1-How-to-Know-if-your-Android-is-SIM-Locked" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: How to Know if your Android is SIM Locked"></a>Part 1: How to Know if your Android is SIM Locked</h2><p>It is important to note that not all phones are SIM locked. You can find out if yours is by checking the Poco X6 Pro device’s documentation. If you see the words “unlocked” on the initial receipt then you know that the Poco X6 Pro device is not SIM locked.</p><p>Another easy way to find out is to ask your carrier if the Poco X6 Pro device is locked on to their network. You can also just try inserting another carrier’s SIM into your device. If it doesn’t work, you will know that the Poco X6 Pro device is SIM locked.</p><p>If you bought your device from a third party re-seller such as Amazon you are more likely to be in possession of an unlocked device.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-SIM-Unlock-your-Android-Device"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-SIM-Unlock-your-Android-Device" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to SIM Unlock your Android Device"></a>Part 2: How to SIM Unlock your Android Device</h2><p>If you find that your SIM is locked, here’s a few things you can do to unlock the Poco X6 Pro device.</p><p>Avoid all of the apps on the Google Play Store that promise to unlock your device, most of them don’t work and may even harbour a lot of Trojans and malware that will cause further problems for you and your device.</p><p>There are safe and very legal ways to unlock your device. Just try one of the following.</p><p><strong><em>Ask your Carrier to Unlock your Device</em></strong></p><p>This is the best option when you want to safely unlock your device. By February 2015, American cell phone owners got the option to request their carriers to unlock their device for them. Before that the law didn’t allow for carriers to unlock SIM cards in the United States. This unpopular law was reversed following a similar move by the European Union in 2013. The same law also requires that the carriers inform customers every month whether their device is eligible for unlocking.</p><p>If your device is eligible for unlocking, all you need to do is contact the carrier provide and request for the <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/unlock/unlock-samsung-sim-network-unlock-pin.html" >sim network unlock pin <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. But if your Smartphone was bought on a contract, you may need to pay a termination fee to break the contract of you want to unlock the Poco X6 Pro device before the contact term expires. For Smartphones that are not on contract, you have to wait 12 months from the date of purchase and ensure that your bill is paid before the carrier can give you the unlock code.</p><p><strong><em>How to Unlock your Android Phone</em></strong></p><p>To begin with, you need to confirm your IMEI number. Dial *#06# on your device and the IMEI number will appear on the screen. Copy this number to a secure location or wrote it down somewhere.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2016/06/14670084741192.jpg"                      alt="How to Unlock your Android Phone"                ></p><p>The next step is to find a reputable service that will unlock your Android device for you.

Having an unlocked device can have its benefits but most of the time most people don’t even know whether their device is SIM locked or not. In this article we are going to address this issue. We are going to begin by helping you find out whether your phone is locked or not and if it is, how you can <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/unlock-android-screen/" >sim unlock <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> the Poco X6 device and enjoy the benefits of an unlocked phone.</p><h2 id="Part-1-How-to-Know-if-your-Android-is-SIM-Locked"><a href="#Part-1-How-to-Know-if-your-Android-is-SIM-Locked" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: How to Know if your Android is SIM Locked"></a>Part 1: How to Know if your Android is SIM Locked</h2><p>It is important to note that not all phones are SIM locked. You can find out if yours is by checking the Poco X6 device’s documentation. If you see the words “unlocked” on the initial receipt then you know that the Poco X6 device is not SIM locked.</p><p>Another easy way to find out is to ask your carrier if the Poco X6 device is locked on to their network. You can also just try inserting another carrier’s SIM into your device. If it doesn’t work, you will know that the Poco X6 device is SIM locked.</p><p>If you bought your device from a third party re-seller such as Amazon you are more likely to be in possession of an unlocked device.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-SIM-Unlock-your-Android-Device"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-SIM-Unlock-your-Android-Device" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to SIM Unlock your Android Device"></a>Part 2: How to SIM Unlock your Android Device</h2><p>If you find that your SIM is locked, here’s a few things you can do to unlock the Poco X6 device.</p><p>Avoid all of the apps on the Google Play Store that promise to unlock your device, most of them don’t work and may even harbour a lot of Trojans and malware that will cause further problems for you and your device.</p><p>There are safe and very legal ways to unlock your device. Just try one of the following.</p><p><strong><em>Ask your Carrier to Unlock your Device</em></strong></p><p>This is the best option when you want to safely unlock your device. By February 2015, American cell phone owners got the option to request their carriers to unlock their device for them. Before that the law didn’t allow for carriers to unlock SIM cards in the United States. This unpopular law was reversed following a similar move by the European Union in 2013. The same law also requires that the carriers inform customers every month whether their device is eligible for unlocking.</p><p>If your device is eligible for unlocking, all you need to do is contact the carrier provide and request for the <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/unlock/unlock-samsung-sim-network-unlock-pin.html" >sim network unlock pin <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. But if your Smartphone was bought on a contract, you may need to pay a termination fee to break the contract of you want to unlock the Poco X6 device before the contact term expires. For Smartphones that are not on contract, you have to wait 12 months from the date of purchase and ensure that your bill is paid before the carrier can give you the unlock code.</p><p><strong><em>How to Unlock your Android Phone</em></strong></p><p>To begin with, you need to confirm your IMEI number. Dial *#06# on your device and the IMEI number will appear on the screen. Copy this number to a secure location or wrote it down somewhere.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2016/06/14670084741192.jpg"                      alt="How to Unlock your Android Phone"                ></p><p>The next step is to find a reputable service that will unlock your Android device for you. This is action you should take only if you are absolutely desperate and your carrier can’t unlock your device for you. This is because many of these sites are unregulated and many of them are not reliable.</p><p>You should also know that many of them will charge a certain amount for your service. You can try <a class="link"   href="https://www.safeunlockcode.com/" >https://www.safeunlockcode.com/ <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> which is one of the more reputable ones we have found.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2016/06/14670084936436.jpg"                      alt="android SIM unlock-safeunlockcode"                ></p><p>You will need to enter the IMEI number as part of the information you need to provide before they can unlock your device.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Troubleshooting-Android-SIM-Unlock"><a href="#Part-3-Troubleshooting-Android-SIM-Unlock" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Troubleshooting Android SIM Unlock"></a>Part 3: Troubleshooting Android SIM Unlock</h2><p>There are lots of issues you may face when you try to unlock your device. The following are just some of the troubleshooting actions you can take if you encounter these problems.</p><p><strong><em>Unlocking Code Fails to work</em></strong></p><p>If you asked your carrier to unlock your device for you, chances are that they sent you a code. If the unlocking code fails to work double check that the IMEI number you used is the correct one and ensure that you purchased that device from that carrier and then try again.</p><p><strong><em>Samsung Device Freezes during unlocking</em></strong></p><p>If your device freezes during the unlocking process it typically means that you entered wrong unlocking code too many times. In this case you need to contact the carrier for a Master Code.</p><p><strong><em>My LG device won’t unlock</em></strong></p><p>There are some LG models that cannot be unlocked. These models include LG U300, LG U310, LG U8180, LG U8330, LG U8120, LG U8360, LG U8380, LGU880, and LG U890. If your device is one of these it can’t be unlocked by your carrier. You may need to look into other ways of unlocking your device.</p><h2 id="Unlocking-Your-Android-Phone-Everything-You-Need-to-Know-to-Use-Any-SIM-Card"><a href="#Unlocking-Your-Android-Phone-Everything-You-Need-to-Know-to-Use-Any-SIM-Card" class="headerlink" title="Unlocking Your Android Phone: Everything You Need to Know to Use Any SIM Card"></a>Unlocking Your Android Phone: Everything You Need to Know to Use Any SIM Card</h2><p>Getting carrier locked on the phone is one of the worst things that can happen especially when you feel there is not much you can do about it. But that’s not really true. There are few ways that could help alleviate this problem or which could come as a help in such circumstances when the Smartphone is carrier locked. This problem often requires help from the carrier or network and can be easily sorted on doing so.</p><p>Now, having talked about SIM lock or carrier lock, it is also important to know whether a device is SIM locked or not, because not all phones are SIM locked. So, to find out whether your phone is network locked, you can check the documentation of the Poco X6 device that you received while purchasing. If the phone is unlocked, the “unlocked word would certainly appear on the receipt. To be sure and precise whether the phone is SIM locked, the best thing that can be done is to contact the carrier and check if the phone is carrier locked. Before that, you can even check the phone yourself by placing a different SIM in the phone and check whether it works. If the same issue persists even with different SIMs, then there is a good chance that the phone is carrier locked. Now that we know how to check if the phone is SIM locked, it is imperative to know how to unlock Android phone for different carrier. It is not that difficult a task to unlock carrier locked phones and there are a few methods to unlock such locked phones.</p><h2 id="Part-1-Asking-the-Carrier-to-Unlock"><a href="#Part-1-Asking-the-Carrier-to-Unlock" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Asking the Carrier to Unlock"></a>Part 1: Asking the Carrier to Unlock</h2><p>One of the best options is getting in touch with the carrier and asking them to unlock the SIM locked phone. For that to happen, it is important to first know whether the phone is SIM locked and then whether the phone can be unlocked and if you are eligible to unlock the phone. There is an eligibility clause in contract for Smartphones bought on contract and if a specific time period is not up yet, then a termination fee is required to be paid by the user to break the contract in order to be able to use any SIM on the Poco X6 device after getting the unlock code.</p><p><strong><em>Pros</em></strong></p><p>• This is the best way to unlock carrier locked devices.</p><p>• This is legal and everything happens based on the clause mentioned in the contract.</p><p><strong>_Cons<br>_</strong></p><p>• Sometimes, even the network providers or carrier refuse to unlock Smartphone</p><p>• There is a certain time period which if not over yet, unlocking the phone would require termination fee.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Professional-Reputable-Smartphone-Unlock-Service"><a href="#Part-2-Professional-Reputable-Smartphone-Unlock-Service" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Professional Reputable Smartphone Unlock Service"></a>Part 2: Professional Reputable Smartphone Unlock Service</h2><p>If you have tried out contacting the carrier and there is no way the carrier is unlocking your phone, you can opt for professional unlock service which could be of help. But finding such a professional service is not an easy task. There are some sites and service providers which require the IMEI number of the phone to create unlock codes. IMEI number of the phone is given to the professional SIM unlock service post which, they generate a special character combination which can be used to get the cell phone out of network restrictions. So, the phone can be unlocked remotely by using the special remote unlock codes.</p><p>Sometimes, the professional Smartphone service providers even ask for the phone to be sent to them to get the phone unlocked.</p><p><strong><em>Pros</em></strong></p><p>• This method could be opted as a last resort if there is no help from the carrier.</p><p>• Professional and reputable Smartphone unlock service providers tend to serve the purpose as they are specialized in this task.</p><p>• There are not many obligations involved.</p><p><strong>_Cons<br>_</strong></p><p>• This might attract legal actions against the user.</p><p>• It is very difficult to find such professional Smartphone unlock service providers.</p><p>• Reliability on such service providers is also another factor which requires attention.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Unlock-Android-to-Use-Any-SIM-via-Doctor-SIM"><a href="#Part-3-Unlock-Android-to-Use-Any-SIM-via-Doctor-SIM" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Unlock Android to Use Any SIM via Doctor SIM"></a>Part 3: Unlock Android to Use Any SIM via Doctor SIM</h2><p>Compared to connecting with your network provider, choosing an unlocking software may be a quicker and easier way. <a class="link"   href="https://www.doctorsim.com/gb-en/?scp" >Doctor SIM <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> could be a good option.

Having an unlocked device can have its benefits but most of the time most people don’t even know whether their device is SIM locked or not. In this article we are going to address this issue. We are going to begin by helping you find out whether your phone is locked or not and if it is, how you can <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/unlock-android-screen/" >sim unlock <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> the Poco X5 device and enjoy the benefits of an unlocked phone.</p><h2 id="Part-1-How-to-Know-if-your-Android-is-SIM-Locked"><a href="#Part-1-How-to-Know-if-your-Android-is-SIM-Locked" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: How to Know if your Android is SIM Locked"></a>Part 1: How to Know if your Android is SIM Locked</h2><p>It is important to note that not all phones are SIM locked. You can find out if yours is by checking the Poco X5 device’s documentation. If you see the words “unlocked” on the initial receipt then you know that the Poco X5 device is not SIM locked.</p><p>Another easy way to find out is to ask your carrier if the Poco X5 device is locked on to their network. You can also just try inserting another carrier’s SIM into your device. If it doesn’t work, you will know that the Poco X5 device is SIM locked.</p><p>If you bought your device from a third party re-seller such as Amazon you are more likely to be in possession of an unlocked device.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-SIM-Unlock-your-Android-Device"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-SIM-Unlock-your-Android-Device" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to SIM Unlock your Android Device"></a>Part 2: How to SIM Unlock your Android Device</h2><p>If you find that your SIM is locked, here’s a few things you can do to unlock the Poco X5 device.</p><p>Avoid all of the apps on the Google Play Store that promise to unlock your device, most of them don’t work and may even harbour a lot of Trojans and malware that will cause further problems for you and your device.</p><p>There are safe and very legal ways to unlock your device. Just try one of the following.</p><p><strong><em>Ask your Carrier to Unlock your Device</em></strong></p><p>This is the best option when you want to safely unlock your device. By February 2015, American cell phone owners got the option to request their carriers to unlock their device for them. Before that the law didn’t allow for carriers to unlock SIM cards in the United States. This unpopular law was reversed following a similar move by the European Union in 2013. The same law also requires that the carriers inform customers every month whether their device is eligible for unlocking.</p><p>If your device is eligible for unlocking, all you need to do is contact the carrier provide and request for the <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/unlock/unlock-samsung-sim-network-unlock-pin.html" >sim network unlock pin <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. But if your Smartphone was bought on a contract, you may need to pay a termination fee to break the contract of you want to unlock the Poco X5 device before the contact term expires. For Smartphones that are not on contract, you have to wait 12 months from the date of purchase and ensure that your bill is paid before the carrier can give you the unlock code.</p><p><strong><em>How to Unlock your Android Phone</em></strong></p><p>To begin with, you need to confirm your IMEI number. Dial *#06# on your device and the IMEI number will appear on the screen. Copy this number to a secure location or wrote it down somewhere.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2016/06/14670084741192.jpg"                      alt="How to Unlock your Android Phone"                ></p><p>The next step is to find a reputable service that will unlock your Android device for you. This is action you should take only if you are absolutely desperate and your carrier can’t unlock your device for you. This is because many of these sites are unregulated and many of them are not reliable.</p><p>You should also know that many of them will charge a certain amount for your service. You can try <a class="link"   href="https://www.safeunlockcode.com/" >https://www.safeunlockcode.com/ <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> which is one of the more reputable ones we have found.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2016/06/14670084936436.jpg"                      alt="android SIM unlock-safeunlockcode"                ></p><p>You will need to enter the IMEI number as part of the information you need to provide before they can unlock your device.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Troubleshooting-Android-SIM-Unlock"><a href="#Part-3-Troubleshooting-Android-SIM-Unlock" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Troubleshooting Android SIM Unlock"></a>Part 3: Troubleshooting Android SIM Unlock</h2><p>There are lots of issues you may face when you try to unlock your device. The following are just some of the troubleshooting actions you can take if you encounter these problems.</p><p><strong><em>Unlocking Code Fails to work</em></strong></p><p>If you asked your carrier to unlock your device for you, chances are that they sent you a code. If the unlocking code fails to work double check that the IMEI number you used is the correct one and ensure that you purchased that device from that carrier and then try again.</p><p><strong><em>Samsung Device Freezes during unlocking</em></strong></p><p>If your device freezes during the unlocking process it typically means that you entered wrong unlocking code too many times. In this case you need to contact the carrier for a Master Code.</p><p><strong><em>My LG device won’t unlock</em></strong></p><p>There are some LG models that cannot be unlocked. These models include LG U300, LG U310, LG U8180, LG U8330, LG U8120, LG U8360, LG U8380, LGU880, and LG U890. If your device is one of these it can’t be unlocked by your carrier. You may need to look into other ways of unlocking your device.</p><h2 id="How-To-Unlock-SIM-Cards-Of-Poco-X5-Without-PUK-Codes"><a href="#How-To-Unlock-SIM-Cards-Of-Poco-X5-Without-PUK-Codes" class="headerlink" title="How To Unlock SIM Cards Of Poco X5 Without PUK Codes"></a>How To Unlock SIM Cards Of Poco X5 Without PUK Codes</h2><p>Unintentionally locking your SIM card with an incorrect PIN is a common occurrence. It’s frustrating because it prevents you from accessing your essential mobile services. Thankfully, Personal Unblocking Key (PUK) codes offer a way to unlock it.

Having an unlocked device can have its benefits but most of the time most people don’t even know whether their device is SIM locked or not. In this article we are going to address this issue. We are going to begin by helping you find out whether your phone is locked or not and if it is, how you can <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/unlock-android-screen/" >sim unlock <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> the Poco M6 Pro 5G device and enjoy the benefits of an unlocked phone.</p><h2 id="Part-1-How-to-Know-if-your-Android-is-SIM-Locked"><a href="#Part-1-How-to-Know-if-your-Android-is-SIM-Locked" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: How to Know if your Android is SIM Locked"></a>Part 1: How to Know if your Android is SIM Locked</h2><p>It is important to note that not all phones are SIM locked. You can find out if yours is by checking the Poco M6 Pro 5G device’s documentation. If you see the words “unlocked” on the initial receipt then you know that the Poco M6 Pro 5G device is not SIM locked.</p><p>Another easy way to find out is to ask your carrier if the Poco M6 Pro 5G device is locked on to their network. You can also just try inserting another carrier’s SIM into your device. If it doesn’t work, you will know that the Poco M6 Pro 5G device is SIM locked.</p><p>If you bought your device from a third party re-seller such as Amazon you are more likely to be in possession of an unlocked device.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-SIM-Unlock-your-Android-Device"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-SIM-Unlock-your-Android-Device" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to SIM Unlock your Android Device"></a>Part 2: How to SIM Unlock your Android Device</h2><p>If you find that your SIM is locked, here’s a few things you can do to unlock the Poco M6 Pro 5G device.</p><p>Avoid all of the apps on the Google Play Store that promise to unlock your device, most of them don’t work and may even harbour a lot of Trojans and malware that will cause further problems for you and your device.</p><p>There are safe and very legal ways to unlock your device. Just try one of the following.</p><p><strong><em>Ask your Carrier to Unlock your Device</em></strong></p><p>This is the best option when you want to safely unlock your device. By February 2015, American cell phone owners got the option to request their carriers to unlock their device for them. Before that the law didn’t allow for carriers to unlock SIM cards in the United States. This unpopular law was reversed following a similar move by the European Union in 2013. The same law also requires that the carriers inform customers every month whether their device is eligible for unlocking.</p><p>If your device is eligible for unlocking, all you need to do is contact the carrier provide and request for the <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/unlock/unlock-samsung-sim-network-unlock-pin.html" >sim network unlock pin <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. But if your Smartphone was bought on a contract, you may need to pay a termination fee to break the contract of you want to unlock the Poco M6 Pro 5G device before the contact term expires. For Smartphones that are not on contract, you have to wait 12 months from the date of purchase and ensure that your bill is paid before the carrier can give you the unlock code.</p><p><strong><em>How to Unlock your Android Phone</em></strong></p><p>To begin with, you need to confirm your IMEI number. Dial *#06# on your device and the IMEI number will appear on the screen. Copy this number to a secure location or wrote it down somewhere.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2016/06/14670084741192.jpg"                      alt="How to Unlock your Android Phone"                ></p><p>The next step is to find a reputable service that will unlock your Android device for you. This is action you should take only if you are absolutely desperate and your carrier can’t unlock your device for you. This is because many of these sites are unregulated and many of them are not reliable.</p><p>You should also know that many of them will charge a certain amount for your service. You can try <a class="link"   href="https://www.safeunlockcode.com/" >https://www.safeunlockcode.com/ <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> which is one of the more reputable ones we have found.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2016/06/14670084936436.jpg"                      alt="android SIM unlock-safeunlockcode"                ></p><p>You will need to enter the IMEI number as part of the information you need to provide before they can unlock your device.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Troubleshooting-Android-SIM-Unlock"><a href="#Part-3-Troubleshooting-Android-SIM-Unlock" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Troubleshooting Android SIM Unlock"></a>Part 3: Troubleshooting Android SIM Unlock</h2><p>There are lots of issues you may face when you try to unlock your device. The following are just some of the troubleshooting actions you can take if you encounter these problems.</p><p><strong><em>Unlocking Code Fails to work</em></strong></p><p>If you asked your carrier to unlock your device for you, chances are that they sent you a code. If the unlocking code fails to work double check that the IMEI number you used is the correct one and ensure that you purchased that device from that carrier and then try again.</p><p><strong><em>Samsung Device Freezes during unlocking</em></strong></p><p>If your device freezes during the unlocking process it typically means that you entered wrong unlocking code too many times. In this case you need to contact the carrier for a Master Code.</p><p><strong><em>My LG device won’t unlock</em></strong></p><p>There are some LG models that cannot be unlocked. These models include LG U300, LG U310, LG U8180, LG U8330, LG U8120, LG U8360, LG U8380, LGU880, and LG U890. If your device is one of these it can’t be unlocked by your carrier. You may need to look into other ways of unlocking your device.</p><h2 id="Top-11-Free-Apps-to-Check-IMEI-on-Poco-M6-Pro-5G-Phones"><a href="#Top-11-Free-Apps-to-Check-IMEI-on-Poco-M6-Pro-5G-Phones" class="headerlink" title="Top 11 Free Apps to Check IMEI on Poco M6 Pro 5G Phones"></a>Top 11 Free Apps to Check IMEI on Poco M6 Pro 5G Phones</h2><p>Your IMEI number is your device’s identity and being able to use it to check the legitimacy of your device should be easy. There are lots of websites that allow you to easily check your IMEI but in this world where we use our mobile devices more, most of us want the convenience of being able to perform this task on our devices.</p><p>For this reason, we saw it fit to compile a list of the best Android and iOS apps that allow you to easily do an IMEI check. Those apps are listed below.</p><h2 id="Part-1-Top-6-Android-Apps-to-Check-your-IMEI-Number"><a href="#Part-1-Top-6-Android-Apps-to-Check-your-IMEI-Number" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Top 6 Android Apps to Check your IMEI Number"></a>Part 1: Top 6 Android Apps to Check your IMEI Number</h2><h3 id="1-IMEI-info"><a href="#1-IMEI-info" class="headerlink" title="1.

Having an unlocked device can have its benefits but most of the time most people don’t even know whether their device is SIM locked or not. In this article we are going to address this issue. We are going to begin by helping you find out whether your phone is locked or not and if it is, how you can <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/unlock-android-screen/" >sim unlock <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> the Poco M6 Pro 4G device and enjoy the benefits of an unlocked phone.</p><h2 id="Part-1-How-to-Know-if-your-Android-is-SIM-Locked"><a href="#Part-1-How-to-Know-if-your-Android-is-SIM-Locked" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: How to Know if your Android is SIM Locked"></a>Part 1: How to Know if your Android is SIM Locked</h2><p>It is important to note that not all phones are SIM locked. You can find out if yours is by checking the Poco M6 Pro 4G device’s documentation. If you see the words “unlocked” on the initial receipt then you know that the Poco M6 Pro 4G device is not SIM locked.</p><p>Another easy way to find out is to ask your carrier if the Poco M6 Pro 4G device is locked on to their network. You can also just try inserting another carrier’s SIM into your device. If it doesn’t work, you will know that the Poco M6 Pro 4G device is SIM locked.</p><p>If you bought your device from a third party re-seller such as Amazon you are more likely to be in possession of an unlocked device.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-SIM-Unlock-your-Android-Device"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-SIM-Unlock-your-Android-Device" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to SIM Unlock your Android Device"></a>Part 2: How to SIM Unlock your Android Device</h2><p>If you find that your SIM is locked, here’s a few things you can do to unlock the Poco M6 Pro 4G device.</p><p>Avoid all of the apps on the Google Play Store that promise to unlock your device, most of them don’t work and may even harbour a lot of Trojans and malware that will cause further problems for you and your device.</p><p>There are safe and very legal ways to unlock your device. Just try one of the following.</p><p><strong><em>Ask your Carrier to Unlock your Device</em></strong></p><p>This is the best option when you want to safely unlock your device. By February 2015, American cell phone owners got the option to request their carriers to unlock their device for them. Before that the law didn’t allow for carriers to unlock SIM cards in the United States. This unpopular law was reversed following a similar move by the European Union in 2013. The same law also requires that the carriers inform customers every month whether their device is eligible for unlocking.</p><p>If your device is eligible for unlocking, all you need to do is contact the carrier provide and request for the <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/unlock/unlock-samsung-sim-network-unlock-pin.html" >sim network unlock pin <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. But if your Smartphone was bought on a contract, you may need to pay a termination fee to break the contract of you want to unlock the Poco M6 Pro 4G device before the contact term expires. For Smartphones that are not on contract, you have to wait 12 months from the date of purchase and ensure that your bill is paid before the carrier can give you the unlock code.</p><p><strong><em>How to Unlock your Android Phone</em></strong></p><p>To begin with, you need to confirm your IMEI number. Dial *#06# on your device and the IMEI number will appear on the screen. Copy this number to a secure location or wrote it down somewhere.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2016/06/14670084741192.jpg"                      alt="How to Unlock your Android Phone"                ></p><p>The next step is to find a reputable service that will unlock your Android device for you. This is action you should take only if you are absolutely desperate and your carrier can’t unlock your device for you. This is because many of these sites are unregulated and many of them are not reliable.</p><p>You should also know that many of them will charge a certain amount for your service. You can try <a class="link"   href="https://www.safeunlockcode.com/" >https://www.safeunlockcode.com/ <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> which is one of the more reputable ones we have found.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2016/06/14670084936436.jpg"                      alt="android SIM unlock-safeunlockcode"                ></p><p>You will need to enter the IMEI number as part of the information you need to provide before they can unlock your device.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Troubleshooting-Android-SIM-Unlock"><a href="#Part-3-Troubleshooting-Android-SIM-Unlock" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Troubleshooting Android SIM Unlock"></a>Part 3: Troubleshooting Android SIM Unlock</h2><p>There are lots of issues you may face when you try to unlock your device. The following are just some of the troubleshooting actions you can take if you encounter these problems.</p><p><strong><em>Unlocking Code Fails to work</em></strong></p><p>If you asked your carrier to unlock your device for you, chances are that they sent you a code. If the unlocking code fails to work double check that the IMEI number you used is the correct one and ensure that you purchased that device from that carrier and then try again.</p><p><strong><em>Samsung Device Freezes during unlocking</em></strong></p><p>If your device freezes during the unlocking process it typically means that you entered wrong unlocking code too many times. In this case you need to contact the carrier for a Master Code.</p><p><strong><em>My LG device won’t unlock</em></strong></p><p>There are some LG models that cannot be unlocked. These models include LG U300, LG U310, LG U8180, LG U8330, LG U8120, LG U8360, LG U8380, LGU880, and LG U890. If your device is one of these it can’t be unlocked by your carrier. You may need to look into other ways of unlocking your device.</p><h2 id="How-To-Change-Your-SIM-PIN-Code-on-Your-Poco-M6-Pro-4G-Phone"><a href="#How-To-Change-Your-SIM-PIN-Code-on-Your-Poco-M6-Pro-4G-Phone" class="headerlink" title="How To Change Your SIM PIN Code on Your Poco M6 Pro 4G Phone"></a>How To Change Your SIM PIN Code on Your Poco M6 Pro 4G Phone</h2><p>When you get a new SIM card, it usually comes with a default PIN (Personal Identity Number) code printed on the packaging, documentation, or back of the SIM card. This 4-digit code protects your phone number from unauthorized calls, texts, and data use. It’s essential to change the default PIN to one that’s both memorable for you and difficult for others to guess.</p><p>So, <strong>how to change the PIN on an Android phone</strong>’s SIM card? This article will provide a step-by-step guide to help you secure your data. But first, let’s explore why changing the default one is important.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/02/how-to-change-pin-on-android-phone-01.jpg"                      alt="a phone sim card"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-Why-Does-Changing-Your-SIM-PIN-Code-Matter-on-a-New-Phone"><a href="#Part-1-Why-Does-Changing-Your-SIM-PIN-Code-Matter-on-a-New-Phone" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Why Does Changing Your SIM PIN Code Matter on a New Phone?"></a>Part 1: Why Does Changing Your SIM PIN Code Matter on a New Phone?</h2><p>Your SIM PIN code acts as a password for your SIM card, which stores your phone number, contacts, and other essential data. Unlike the PIN you use to unlock your phone, the SIM PIN code is a separate layer of security. If someone tries to use your SIM card in another phone without the correct PIN, they won’t be able to access your network or data.</p><p>Here are more reasons why <strong>changing the PIN code of a SIM card</strong> is a smart move:</p><ul><li>Default PINs are easy to guess</li></ul><p>Most carriers use generic PINs like “1234” or “0000”. Change it to something unique and harder to crack.</p><ul><li>Protects data in case of loss or theft</li></ul><p>If you lose your phone or it gets stolen, a strong PIN code hinders the thief’s ability to make calls, send messages, or access your data stored on the SIM. It buys you time to report the loss and block your SIM card before they can do any damage.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/02/how-to-change-pin-on-android-phone-02.jpg"                      alt="sim card locked"                ></p><ul><li>Prevents accidental PIN lockouts</li></ul><p>Using a memorable PIN minimizes the risk of accidentally locking yourself out of your SIM card.</p><ul><li>Peace of mind</li></ul><p>It is crucial if you store sensitive info on your SIM or use your phone for work. Knowing about this extra safeguard is reassuring, ensuring your data stays protected.</p><p><strong>Remember:</strong></p><p>Choose a PIN code for your SIM that’s easy for you to remember but challenging for others to guess. Avoid using birthdays, anniversaries, or other easily identifiable information. By taking a few minutes to <strong>change the PIN code of the SIM card</strong>, you’ll gain a significant security advantage for your new phone and data.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-To-Change-Pin-on-Android-Phone-SIM-Cards"><a href="#Part-2-How-To-Change-Pin-on-Android-Phone-SIM-Cards" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How To Change Pin on Android Phone SIM Cards?"></a>Part 2: How To Change Pin on Android Phone SIM Cards?</h2><p>Keeping your SIM card secure is crucial for protecting your data and privacy. Thankfully, Android allows you to easily change your SIM card PIN to a more personal and memorable code. But before you begin:</p><ul><li>Contact your network carrier to get your PUK code if you already have it. You’ll need this if you enter the wrong PIN three times and lock your SIM card.</li><li>Remember the temporary default PIN: Most SIM cards have a default PIN, often 1234 or 0123. If you haven’t changed it, this is the PIN you’ll use initially.</li></ul><p><strong>Note:</strong></p><p>Entering the wrong PIN three times will lock your SIM card. You’ll need your network carrier’s PUK code to unlock it. Use it cautiously, as exceeding the maximum number of attempts will permanently block your SIM card. So, it’s best to memorize your PIN or store it securely to avoid relying on the PUK altogether.</p><p>Steps To Change Your SIM PIN</p><p>Here’s <strong>how to find and manage the SIM PIN code on Android</strong>:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Navigate to your phone’s <strong>Settings</strong> app. Next, look for the <strong>Security and privacy</strong> or <strong>Lock screen and security</strong> (or other similar option) depending on your device’s model.</li><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Scroll down and tap on <strong>More security settings</strong> or <strong>Other security settings</strong>.</li><li><strong>Step 3:</strong> Tap <strong>SIM card security</strong> or <strong>Set up SIM card lock</strong> (or something similar).</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/02/how-to-change-pin-on-android-phone-03.jpg"                      alt="sim card security in settings"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Step 4:</strong> If you have multiple SIMs, select the one you want to change the PIN code.</li><li><strong>Step 5:</strong> Tap <strong>Change SIM PIN</strong>.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/02/how-to-change-pin-on-android-phone-04.jpg"                      alt="change sim pin code on android"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Step 6:</strong> Input your current SIM card PIN code and tap <strong>OK</strong>.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/02/how-to-change-pin-on-android-phone-05.jpg"                      alt="enter old sim pin"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Step 7:</strong> Enter your desired new PIN code and tap <strong>OK</strong>.</li><li><strong>Step 8:</strong> Re-enter your new SIM card PIN code and tap <strong>OK</strong> to confirm.</li></ul><p>Success! You’ve successfully <strong>changed the PIN code of your SIM card</strong>.

But for iPhone users, forgetting it can lock you out. So, what should you do if you <strong>lose the SIM PIN</strong> code on iOS?</p><p>First, avoid guessing your SIM PIN or PUK code. Every wrong guess increases the risk of permanently locking your SIM card, requiring a replacement. If you forget your PIN, contact your network carrier for help. They can usually unlock your SIM with the default PIN or PUK code. If that fails, you can request a new SIM card.</p><p>However, there might also be situations where you’re locked out due to a carrier-restricted SIM card.

Here are some of them:</p><p><strong>Advantages</strong></p><ol><li>Make your Android untraceable.

Therefore, by changing your Android’s IMEI number to that of a BlackBerry’s, you will be able to subscribe to a cheaper mobile plan.</li></ol><p><strong>Disadvantages</strong></p><ol><li>Before we begin, we need to make it clear that the process of changing IMEI without root can be illegal in some countries. We advise you to check the laws and regulations in your country before attempting to change your device’s IMEI number.

Therefore, changing your device’s IMEI number may void your device warranty and cause other issues such as network problems and software instability.</li><li>Legally, you have forfeited your ownership of your mobile device. When you purchase your device, the seller will jot down the original IMEI number on your receipt. So if you changed your IMEI and lost it, you may not be able to claim it. This is because authorities cannot see if it is truly yours.

Having an unlocked device can have its benefits but most of the time most people don’t even know whether their device is SIM locked or not. In this article we are going to address this issue. We are going to begin by helping you find out whether your phone is locked or not and if it is, how you can <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/unlock-android-screen/" >sim unlock <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> the Poco M6 5G device and enjoy the benefits of an unlocked phone.</p><h2 id="Part-1-How-to-Know-if-your-Android-is-SIM-Locked"><a href="#Part-1-How-to-Know-if-your-Android-is-SIM-Locked" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: How to Know if your Android is SIM Locked"></a>Part 1: How to Know if your Android is SIM Locked</h2><p>It is important to note that not all phones are SIM locked. You can find out if yours is by checking the Poco M6 5G device’s documentation. If you see the words “unlocked” on the initial receipt then you know that the Poco M6 5G device is not SIM locked.</p><p>Another easy way to find out is to ask your carrier if the Poco M6 5G device is locked on to their network. You can also just try inserting another carrier’s SIM into your device. If it doesn’t work, you will know that the Poco M6 5G device is SIM locked.</p><p>If you bought your device from a third party re-seller such as Amazon you are more likely to be in possession of an unlocked device.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-SIM-Unlock-your-Android-Device"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-SIM-Unlock-your-Android-Device" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to SIM Unlock your Android Device"></a>Part 2: How to SIM Unlock your Android Device</h2><p>If you find that your SIM is locked, here’s a few things you can do to unlock the Poco M6 5G device.</p><p>Avoid all of the apps on the Google Play Store that promise to unlock your device, most of them don’t work and may even harbour a lot of Trojans and malware that will cause further problems for you and your device.</p><p>There are safe and very legal ways to unlock your device. Just try one of the following.</p><p><strong><em>Ask your Carrier to Unlock your Device</em></strong></p><p>This is the best option when you want to safely unlock your device. By February 2015, American cell phone owners got the option to request their carriers to unlock their device for them. Before that the law didn’t allow for carriers to unlock SIM cards in the United States. This unpopular law was reversed following a similar move by the European Union in 2013. The same law also requires that the carriers inform customers every month whether their device is eligible for unlocking.</p><p>If your device is eligible for unlocking, all you need to do is contact the carrier provide and request for the <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/unlock/unlock-samsung-sim-network-unlock-pin.html" >sim network unlock pin <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. But if your Smartphone was bought on a contract, you may need to pay a termination fee to break the contract of you want to unlock the Poco M6 5G device before the contact term expires. For Smartphones that are not on contract, you have to wait 12 months from the date of purchase and ensure that your bill is paid before the carrier can give you the unlock code.</p><p><strong><em>How to Unlock your Android Phone</em></strong></p><p>To begin with, you need to confirm your IMEI number. Dial *#06# on your device and the IMEI number will appear on the screen. Copy this number to a secure location or wrote it down somewhere.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2016/06/14670084741192.jpg"                      alt="How to Unlock your Android Phone"                ></p><p>The next step is to find a reputable service that will unlock your Android device for you. This is action you should take only if you are absolutely desperate and your carrier can’t unlock your device for you. This is because many of these sites are unregulated and many of them are not reliable.</p><p>You should also know that many of them will charge a certain amount for your service. You can try <a class="link"   href="https://www.safeunlockcode.com/" >https://www.safeunlockcode.com/ <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> which is one of the more reputable ones we have found.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2016/06/14670084936436.jpg"                      alt="android SIM unlock-safeunlockcode"                ></p><p>You will need to enter the IMEI number as part of the information you need to provide before they can unlock your device.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Troubleshooting-Android-SIM-Unlock"><a href="#Part-3-Troubleshooting-Android-SIM-Unlock" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Troubleshooting Android SIM Unlock"></a>Part 3: Troubleshooting Android SIM Unlock</h2><p>There are lots of issues you may face when you try to unlock your device. The following are just some of the troubleshooting actions you can take if you encounter these problems.</p><p><strong><em>Unlocking Code Fails to work</em></strong></p><p>If you asked your carrier to unlock your device for you, chances are that they sent you a code. If the unlocking code fails to work double check that the IMEI number you used is the correct one and ensure that you purchased that device from that carrier and then try again.</p><p><strong><em>Samsung Device Freezes during unlocking</em></strong></p><p>If your device freezes during the unlocking process it typically means that you entered wrong unlocking code too many times. In this case you need to contact the carrier for a Master Code.</p><p><strong><em>My LG device won’t unlock</em></strong></p><p>There are some LG models that cannot be unlocked. These models include LG U300, LG U310, LG U8180, LG U8330, LG U8120, LG U8360, LG U8380, LGU880, and LG U890. If your device is one of these it can’t be unlocked by your carrier. You may need to look into other ways of unlocking your device.</p><h2 id="Ways-To-Find-Unlocking-Codes-For-Poco-M6-5G-Phones"><a href="#Ways-To-Find-Unlocking-Codes-For-Poco-M6-5G-Phones" class="headerlink" title="Ways To Find Unlocking Codes For Poco M6 5G Phones"></a>Ways To Find Unlocking Codes For Poco M6 5G Phones</h2><p>When you have a locked device, it is pretty much impossible to move from one network to another. This would cause problems if for instance you wanted to travel outside the country and want to switch to that country’s carrier for the duration of your stay. Or maybe you just want to switch carriers because you don’t like your current provider.</p><p>Whatever the reason, you should be able to unlock your device easily. But this has often proven difficult because of the fact that you need unlock codes. The problem is that many sites promise free unlocking codes for your device and many turn out to be fraudulent sites that use the word “free” in their advertising but actually require you to pay for the service. If you have been unsuccessfully searching for free unlocking codes for your device, look no further. This article compiles three of the best for Android and iPhone.</p><h2 id="Part-1-3-Ways-to-Find-Unlocking-Codes-for-Android-Devices"><a href="#Part-1-3-Ways-to-Find-Unlocking-Codes-for-Android-Devices" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: 3 Ways to Find Unlocking Codes for Android Devices"></a>Part 1: 3 Ways to Find Unlocking Codes for Android Devices</h2><h3 id="1-Unlock-it-Free"><a href="#1-Unlock-it-Free" class="headerlink" title="1.

But that’s not really true. There are few ways that could help alleviate this problem or which could come as a help in such circumstances when the Smartphone is carrier locked. This problem often requires help from the carrier or network and can be easily sorted on doing so.</p><p>Now, having talked about SIM lock or carrier lock, it is also important to know whether a device is SIM locked or not, because not all phones are SIM locked. So, to find out whether your phone is network locked, you can check the documentation of the Poco M6 5G device that you received while purchasing. If the phone is unlocked, the “unlocked word would certainly appear on the receipt. To be sure and precise whether the phone is SIM locked, the best thing that can be done is to contact the carrier and check if the phone is carrier locked. Before that, you can even check the phone yourself by placing a different SIM in the phone and check whether it works. If the same issue persists even with different SIMs, then there is a good chance that the phone is carrier locked. Now that we know how to check if the phone is SIM locked, it is imperative to know how to unlock Android phone for different carrier. It is not that difficult a task to unlock carrier locked phones and there are a few methods to unlock such locked phones.</p><h2 id="Part-1-Asking-the-Carrier-to-Unlock"><a href="#Part-1-Asking-the-Carrier-to-Unlock" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Asking the Carrier to Unlock"></a>Part 1: Asking the Carrier to Unlock</h2><p>One of the best options is getting in touch with the carrier and asking them to unlock the SIM locked phone. For that to happen, it is important to first know whether the phone is SIM locked and then whether the phone can be unlocked and if you are eligible to unlock the phone. There is an eligibility clause in contract for Smartphones bought on contract and if a specific time period is not up yet, then a termination fee is required to be paid by the user to break the contract in order to be able to use any SIM on the Poco M6 5G device after getting the unlock code.</p><p><strong><em>Pros</em></strong></p><p>• This is the best way to unlock carrier locked devices.</p><p>• This is legal and everything happens based on the clause mentioned in the contract.</p><p><strong>_Cons<br>_</strong></p><p>• Sometimes, even the network providers or carrier refuse to unlock Smartphone</p><p>• There is a certain time period which if not over yet, unlocking the phone would require termination fee.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Professional-Reputable-Smartphone-Unlock-Service"><a href="#Part-2-Professional-Reputable-Smartphone-Unlock-Service" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Professional Reputable Smartphone Unlock Service"></a>Part 2: Professional Reputable Smartphone Unlock Service</h2><p>If you have tried out contacting the carrier and there is no way the carrier is unlocking your phone, you can opt for professional unlock service which could be of help. But finding such a professional service is not an easy task. There are some sites and service providers which require the IMEI number of the phone to create unlock codes. IMEI number of the phone is given to the professional SIM unlock service post which, they generate a special character combination which can be used to get the cell phone out of network restrictions. So, the phone can be unlocked remotely by using the special remote unlock codes.</p><p>Sometimes, the professional Smartphone service providers even ask for the phone to be sent to them to get the phone unlocked.</p><p><strong><em>Pros</em></strong></p><p>• This method could be opted as a last resort if there is no help from the carrier.</p><p>• Professional and reputable Smartphone unlock service providers tend to serve the purpose as they are specialized in this task.</p><p>• There are not many obligations involved.</p><p><strong>_Cons<br>_</strong></p><p>• This might attract legal actions against the user.</p><p>• It is very difficult to find such professional Smartphone unlock service providers.</p><p>• Reliability on such service providers is also another factor which requires attention.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Unlock-Android-to-Use-Any-SIM-via-Doctor-SIM"><a href="#Part-3-Unlock-Android-to-Use-Any-SIM-via-Doctor-SIM" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Unlock Android to Use Any SIM via Doctor SIM"></a>Part 3: Unlock Android to Use Any SIM via Doctor SIM</h2><p>Compared to connecting with your network provider, choosing an unlocking software may be a quicker and easier way. <a class="link"   href="https://www.doctorsim.com/gb-en/?scp" >Doctor SIM <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> could be a good option.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Easily-Unlock-Your-Poco-F5-Pro-5G-Device-SIM"><a href="#Easily-Unlock-Your-Poco-F5-Pro-5G-Device-SIM" class="headerlink" title="Easily Unlock Your Poco F5 Pro 5G Device SIM"></a>Easily Unlock Your Poco F5 Pro 5G Device SIM</h2><p>Is your Android phone SIM locked? Having an unlocked device can have its benefits but most of the time most people don’t even know whether their device is SIM locked or not. In this article we are going to address this issue. We are going to begin by helping you find out whether your phone is locked or not and if it is, how you can <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/unlock-android-screen/" >sim unlock <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> the Poco F5 Pro 5G device and enjoy the benefits of an unlocked phone.</p><h2 id="Part-1-How-to-Know-if-your-Android-is-SIM-Locked"><a href="#Part-1-How-to-Know-if-your-Android-is-SIM-Locked" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: How to Know if your Android is SIM Locked"></a>Part 1: How to Know if your Android is SIM Locked</h2><p>It is important to note that not all phones are SIM locked. You can find out if yours is by checking the Poco F5 Pro 5G device’s documentation. If you see the words “unlocked” on the initial receipt then you know that the Poco F5 Pro 5G device is not SIM locked.</p><p>Another easy way to find out is to ask your carrier if the Poco F5 Pro 5G device is locked on to their network. You can also just try inserting another carrier’s SIM into your device. If it doesn’t work, you will know that the Poco F5 Pro 5G device is SIM locked.</p><p>If you bought your device from a third party re-seller such as Amazon you are more likely to be in possession of an unlocked device.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-SIM-Unlock-your-Android-Device"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-SIM-Unlock-your-Android-Device" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to SIM Unlock your Android Device"></a>Part 2: How to SIM Unlock your Android Device</h2><p>If you find that your SIM is locked, here’s a few things you can do to unlock the Poco F5 Pro 5G device.</p><p>Avoid all of the apps on the Google Play Store that promise to unlock your device, most of them don’t work and may even harbour a lot of Trojans and malware that will cause further problems for you and your device.</p><p>There are safe and very legal ways to unlock your device. Just try one of the following.</p><p><strong><em>Ask your Carrier to Unlock your Device</em></strong></p><p>This is the best option when you want to safely unlock your device. By February 2015, American cell phone owners got the option to request their carriers to unlock their device for them. Before that the law didn’t allow for carriers to unlock SIM cards in the United States. This unpopular law was reversed following a similar move by the European Union in 2013. The same law also requires that the carriers inform customers every month whether their device is eligible for unlocking.</p><p>If your device is eligible for unlocking, all you need to do is contact the carrier provide and request for the <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/unlock/unlock-samsung-sim-network-unlock-pin.html" >sim network unlock pin <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. But if your Smartphone was bought on a contract, you may need to pay a termination fee to break the contract of you want to unlock the Poco F5 Pro 5G device before the contact term expires. For Smartphones that are not on contract, you have to wait 12 months from the date of purchase and ensure that your bill is paid before the carrier can give you the unlock code.</p><p><strong><em>How to Unlock your Android Phone</em></strong></p><p>To begin with, you need to confirm your IMEI number. Dial *#06# on your device and the IMEI number will appear on the screen. Copy this number to a secure location or wrote it down somewhere.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2016/06/14670084741192.jpg"                      alt="How to Unlock your Android Phone"                ></p><p>The next step is to find a reputable service that will unlock your Android device for you. This is action you should take only if you are absolutely desperate and your carrier can’t unlock your device for you. This is because many of these sites are unregulated and many of them are not reliable.</p><p>You should also know that many of them will charge a certain amount for your service. You can try <a class="link"   href="https://www.safeunlockcode.com/" >https://www.safeunlockcode.com/ <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> which is one of the more reputable ones we have found.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2016/06/14670084936436.jpg"                      alt="android SIM unlock-safeunlockcode"                ></p><p>You will need to enter the IMEI number as part of the information you need to provide before they can unlock your device.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Troubleshooting-Android-SIM-Unlock"><a href="#Part-3-Troubleshooting-Android-SIM-Unlock" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Troubleshooting Android SIM Unlock"></a>Part 3: Troubleshooting Android SIM Unlock</h2><p>There are lots of issues you may face when you try to unlock your device. The following are just some of the troubleshooting actions you can take if you encounter these problems.</p><p><strong><em>Unlocking Code Fails to work</em></strong></p><p>If you asked your carrier to unlock your device for you, chances are that they sent you a code. If the unlocking code fails to work double check that the IMEI number you used is the correct one and ensure that you purchased that device from that carrier and then try again.</p><p><strong><em>Samsung Device Freezes during unlocking</em></strong></p><p>If your device freezes during the unlocking process it typically means that you entered wrong unlocking code too many times. In this case you need to contact the carrier for a Master Code.</p><p><strong><em>My LG device won’t unlock</em></strong></p><p>There are some LG models that cannot be unlocked. These models include LG U300, LG U310, LG U8180, LG U8330, LG U8120, LG U8360, LG U8380, LGU880, and LG U890. If your device is one of these it can’t be unlocked by your carrier. You may need to look into other ways of unlocking your device.</p><h2 id="Android-Unlock-Code-Sim-Unlock-Your-Poco-F5-Pro-5G-Phone-and-Remove-Locked-Screen"><a href="#Android-Unlock-Code-Sim-Unlock-Your-Poco-F5-Pro-5G-Phone-and-Remove-Locked-Screen" class="headerlink" title="Android Unlock Code: Sim Unlock Your Poco F5 Pro 5G Phone and Remove Locked Screen"></a>Android Unlock Code: Sim Unlock Your Poco F5 Pro 5G Phone and Remove Locked Screen</h2><p>When you buy a phone, your matter of concern is whether to buy a locked phone or an unlocked Phone. Locked phones may look much safer to you, but they are very inconvenient when it comes to normal use. These phones are bound to one carrier only, which is their biggest disadvantage. At the same time, unlocked phones save you from this hassle.</p><p>If you’ve bought a locked phone and facing problems, you need not worry as there are multiple ways to unlock your phone. For that, this article has provided the solution to your issue in the most intelligible way.</p><h2 id="Part-1-Difference-between-Unlocking-Rooting-and-Jailbreaking"><a href="#Part-1-Difference-between-Unlocking-Rooting-and-Jailbreaking" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Difference between Unlocking, Rooting, and Jailbreaking"></a>Part 1: Difference between Unlocking, Rooting, and Jailbreaking</h2><p>This part of the article shall differ from three very similar terms, Unlocking, Rooting, and Jailbreaking, to clear your confusion.</p><h3 id="Unlocking"><a href="#Unlocking" class="headerlink" title="Unlocking"></a>Unlocking</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/09/sim-unlock.jpg"                      alt="sim unlock"                ></p><p>Unlocking a phone means making it compatible with other SIM carriers. An unlocked phone is not pinned to a single SIM carrier; rather, it lets you switch carriers. SIM Card lets your phone connect to a specific network, but it depends on your phone’s hardware compatibility. If it’s not compatible with a specific network, then nothing can change that.</p><p>To unlock your phone, you have to enter a specific code to remove the restrictions of the network. However, there are ways to unlock your phone without granting permission from the network.</p><h3 id="Rooting-for-Android"><a href="#Rooting-for-Android" class="headerlink" title="Rooting (for Android)"></a>Rooting (for Android)</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/09/root-android.jpg"                      alt="androi root"                ></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/root/reasons-to-root-android.html" >Rooting a phone <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> means gaining “root access” on another phone. <strong>This process works for Android only.</strong> However, it can also be used on some specific Linux-based devices. Root access allows you to do almost everything on the phone you’ve gained access to, like installing or uninstalling applications or changing the settings.</p><p>Root access is not all fun, and games as this process will lead you to the security architect of your operating system, which will be hard to deal with even if you’re a professional. So, it’s important to be careful with this process, else you will have to bear the consequences.</p><h3 id="Jailbreaking-for-iOS"><a href="#Jailbreaking-for-iOS" class="headerlink" title="Jailbreaking (for iOS)"></a>Jailbreaking (for iOS)</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/09/iphone-jailbreak.jpg"                      alt="iphone Jailbreak"                ></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/guide/how-to-jailbreak-ios-on-windows.html" >Jailbreaking a device <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> means removing all the restrictions on that device that its manufacturer’s applied. <strong>This process works specifically for Apple devices.</strong> It lets you bypass the limitations and restrictions, so you can modify the software your way and make changes to the default program. It is also considered free booting, and Apple or any other company does not approve of it.</p><p>In summary, unlocking is primarily about freeing a device from carrier restrictions, rooting is specific to Android devices and involves gaining administrative access, while jailbreaking is specific to iOS devices and involves bypassing Apple’s restrictions for more customization. All these processes come with potential risks and may void warranties, so users should carefully consider the implications before proceeding.</p><p>It is advisable to always go for the safest method, unlocking your phone. Rooting and Jailbreaking are risky security exploitations that can cause serious problems.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Is-it-Legally-Allowed-to-Unlock-Your-Poco-F5-Pro-5G"><a href="#Part-2-Is-it-Legally-Allowed-to-Unlock-Your-Poco-F5-Pro-5G" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Is it Legally Allowed to Unlock Your Poco F5 Pro 5G?"></a>Part 2: Is it Legally Allowed to Unlock Your Poco F5 Pro 5G?</h2><p>Every country has its own rules and regulations. Similarly, laws regarding unlocking your phones are different in different countries. However, after sessions of deliberations and consultations, the US has declared it legal to unlock your phone.</p><p>In order to legally unlock your phone, you must make sure your phone service contracts, payments, and dues are cleared. You must be the sole owner of your phone. Once your phone is eligible and falls under the requirements, you will be given an “Unlock Code” to proceed further.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Free-Ways-to-Perform-Android-SIM-Efficiently"><a href="#Part-3-Free-Ways-to-Perform-Android-SIM-Efficiently" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Free Ways to Perform Android SIM Efficiently"></a>Part 3: Free Ways to Perform Android SIM Efficiently</h2><p>This part of the article will briefly explain some efficient and free-of-cost ways to unlock your SIM.</p><h3 id="Method-1-Unlock-your-SIM-through-GalaxSim-Unlock"><a href="#Method-1-Unlock-your-SIM-through-GalaxSim-Unlock" class="headerlink" title="Method 1.

This will save you from long-term hassle as you will have the freedom to switch carriers and SIM cards whenever you like. On the other hand, if we talk about locked phones, they’re expensive and a headache to deal with because of the requirements and problems they come with.</p><p>If you’re concerned about a dual-SIM phone, then you can have one SIM pinned to a good quality carrier. The other SIM can be temporary and cheap. This is an amazing option for you if you’re traveling, as you’ll have the flexibility to change carriers for the temporary SIM no matter wherever you are.</p><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>As a crux, an unlocked phone is a better choice than a locked phone. We would personally advise you to go for unlocked phones as this will save your time and money. You will have much more freedom and flexibility for changing between SIM and SIM carriers.

Having an unlocked device can have its benefits but most of the time most people don’t even know whether their device is SIM locked or not. In this article we are going to address this issue. We are going to begin by helping you find out whether your phone is locked or not and if it is, how you can <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/unlock-android-screen/" >sim unlock <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> the Poco F5 5G device and enjoy the benefits of an unlocked phone.</p><h2 id="Part-1-How-to-Know-if-your-Android-is-SIM-Locked"><a href="#Part-1-How-to-Know-if-your-Android-is-SIM-Locked" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: How to Know if your Android is SIM Locked"></a>Part 1: How to Know if your Android is SIM Locked</h2><p>It is important to note that not all phones are SIM locked. You can find out if yours is by checking the Poco F5 5G device’s documentation. If you see the words “unlocked” on the initial receipt then you know that the Poco F5 5G device is not SIM locked.</p><p>Another easy way to find out is to ask your carrier if the Poco F5 5G device is locked on to their network. You can also just try inserting another carrier’s SIM into your device. If it doesn’t work, you will know that the Poco F5 5G device is SIM locked.</p><p>If you bought your device from a third party re-seller such as Amazon you are more likely to be in possession of an unlocked device.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-SIM-Unlock-your-Android-Device"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-SIM-Unlock-your-Android-Device" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to SIM Unlock your Android Device"></a>Part 2: How to SIM Unlock your Android Device</h2><p>If you find that your SIM is locked, here’s a few things you can do to unlock the Poco F5 5G device.</p><p>Avoid all of the apps on the Google Play Store that promise to unlock your device, most of them don’t work and may even harbour a lot of Trojans and malware that will cause further problems for you and your device.</p><p>There are safe and very legal ways to unlock your device. Just try one of the following.</p><p><strong><em>Ask your Carrier to Unlock your Device</em></strong></p><p>This is the best option when you want to safely unlock your device. By February 2015, American cell phone owners got the option to request their carriers to unlock their device for them. Before that the law didn’t allow for carriers to unlock SIM cards in the United States. This unpopular law was reversed following a similar move by the European Union in 2013. The same law also requires that the carriers inform customers every month whether their device is eligible for unlocking.</p><p>If your device is eligible for unlocking, all you need to do is contact the carrier provide and request for the <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/unlock/unlock-samsung-sim-network-unlock-pin.html" >sim network unlock pin <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. But if your Smartphone was bought on a contract, you may need to pay a termination fee to break the contract of you want to unlock the Poco F5 5G device before the contact term expires. For Smartphones that are not on contract, you have to wait 12 months from the date of purchase and ensure that your bill is paid before the carrier can give you the unlock code.</p><p><strong><em>How to Unlock your Android Phone</em></strong></p><p>To begin with, you need to confirm your IMEI number. Dial *#06# on your device and the IMEI number will appear on the screen. Copy this number to a secure location or wrote it down somewhere.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2016/06/14670084741192.jpg"                      alt="How to Unlock your Android Phone"                ></p><p>The next step is to find a reputable service that will unlock your Android device for you. This is action you should take only if you are absolutely desperate and your carrier can’t unlock your device for you. This is because many of these sites are unregulated and many of them are not reliable.</p><p>You should also know that many of them will charge a certain amount for your service. You can try <a class="link"   href="https://www.safeunlockcode.com/" >https://www.safeunlockcode.com/ <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> which is one of the more reputable ones we have found.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2016/06/14670084936436.jpg"                      alt="android SIM unlock-safeunlockcode"                ></p><p>You will need to enter the IMEI number as part of the information you need to provide before they can unlock your device.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Troubleshooting-Android-SIM-Unlock"><a href="#Part-3-Troubleshooting-Android-SIM-Unlock" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Troubleshooting Android SIM Unlock"></a>Part 3: Troubleshooting Android SIM Unlock</h2><p>There are lots of issues you may face when you try to unlock your device. The following are just some of the troubleshooting actions you can take if you encounter these problems.</p><p><strong><em>Unlocking Code Fails to work</em></strong></p><p>If you asked your carrier to unlock your device for you, chances are that they sent you a code. If the unlocking code fails to work double check that the IMEI number you used is the correct one and ensure that you purchased that device from that carrier and then try again.</p><p><strong><em>Samsung Device Freezes during unlocking</em></strong></p><p>If your device freezes during the unlocking process it typically means that you entered wrong unlocking code too many times. In this case you need to contact the carrier for a Master Code.</p><p><strong><em>My LG device won’t unlock</em></strong></p><p>There are some LG models that cannot be unlocked. These models include LG U300, LG U310, LG U8180, LG U8330, LG U8120, LG U8360, LG U8380, LGU880, and LG U890. If your device is one of these it can’t be unlocked by your carrier. You may need to look into other ways of unlocking your device.</p><h2 id="What-Does-‘Enter-PUK-Code’-Mean-And-Why-Did-The-Sim-Get-PUK-Blocked-On-Poco-F5-5G-Device"><a href="#What-Does-‘Enter-PUK-Code’-Mean-And-Why-Did-The-Sim-Get-PUK-Blocked-On-Poco-F5-5G-Device" class="headerlink" title="What Does ‘Enter PUK Code’ Mean And Why Did The Sim Get PUK Blocked On Poco F5 5G Device"></a>What Does ‘Enter PUK Code’ Mean And Why Did The Sim Get PUK Blocked On Poco F5 5G Device</h2><p>If your SIM card is disabled, you probably entered the incorrect PIN code too frequently. Your SIM locks itself after three to five wrong inputs, on average. Although it might be annoying, doing these guards against unauthorized access to your phone and personal data. If your cell phone is lost or stolen, PUK blocked will prevent prospective hackers from making calls.</p><p>Your mobile phone display can say “PIN blocked” or “Enter PUK code.” PUK stands for PIN Unblocking Key in the PUK code. The PUK code is seldom given to you when you receive your membership in the US. Contact Your Poco F5 5G provider’s customer support if you don’t know your PUK code.</p><h2 id="Part-1-Why-Was-My-Sim-Card-Blocked"><a href="#Part-1-Why-Was-My-Sim-Card-Blocked" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Why Was My Sim Card Blocked?"></a>Part 1: Why Was My Sim Card Blocked?</h2><h3 id="1-3-times-incorrect-Pin-entered"><a href="#1-3-times-incorrect-Pin-entered" class="headerlink" title="1. 3 times incorrect Pin entered"></a>1. 3 times incorrect Pin entered</h3><p>Sometimes when you forget your pin and keep on entering the wrong one, you can get PUK Blocked. You can utilize three to five chances, and your sim gets blocked when you enter the incorrect pin in all of these attempts.</p><h3 id="2-Wrong-PUK-code-entered"><a href="#2-Wrong-PUK-code-entered" class="headerlink" title="2. Wrong PUK code entered"></a>2. Wrong PUK code entered</h3><p>Sims are frequently blocked; therefore, if you have your PUK, keep it in a secure location separate from your phone. This is because it is the key to unlocking your SIM. The SIM will be permanently disabled, and you will have to buy a new SIM card if you input the wrong PUK ten times in a row.</p><h2 id="Part-2-What-To-Do-When-I-Blocked-My-Sim-Card"><a href="#Part-2-What-To-Do-When-I-Blocked-My-Sim-Card" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: What To Do When I Blocked My Sim Card?"></a>Part 2: What To Do When I Blocked My Sim Card?</h2><p>Your SIM card has been disabled to protect your security if you enter three wrong PINs and your phone shows “SIM card banned” or “Enter PUK code”.</p><p>You must input a PUK (PIN Unlock Key) code to unlock your SIM card.</p><p>Go to your phone’s settings to customize your PIN code after using a PUK code to unlock your SIM card. Pick a PIN that is simple to remember.</p><p>If your PUK code was delivered to you by email:</p><p>You got an email with multiple codes, including PUK1, PIN2, and PUK2.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/10/how-to-unlock-puk-blocked-sim-card-1.jpg"                      alt="go to settings and customize to unblock sim"                ></p><p>If your PIN is locked, use PUK1 to unlock it.</p><p>Only a few phones employ PIN2 and PUK2 codes to restrict access to certain SIM card functionalities.</p><p>PIN2: The default code for your SIM card; If this code has been altered, use the PUK2 code to restore it.</p><p>PUK2: Your PIN2’s unlock code if it has been blocked.</p><h2 id="Part-3-How-Can-I-Have-My-PUK-Code-To-Unlock-Sim-Card"><a href="#Part-3-How-Can-I-Have-My-PUK-Code-To-Unlock-Sim-Card" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How Can I Have My PUK Code To Unlock Sim Card?"></a>Part 3: How Can I Have My PUK Code To Unlock Sim Card?</h2><h3 id="1-Get-it-from-sim-card-packaging"><a href="#1-Get-it-from-sim-card-packaging" class="headerlink" title="1. Get it from sim card packaging"></a>1. Get it from sim card packaging</h3><p>The packing box is the best and easiest place to look for the PUK code to unlock your SIM card.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/10/how-to-unlock-puk-blocked-sim-card-2.jpg"                      alt="sim card packaging to unlock sim card"                ></p><p>You probably have memories of the flat plastic package you got when you bought a SIM card. Your PUK and default SIM pin code should be written on the package.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/10/how-to-unlock-puk-blocked-sim-card-3.jpg"                      alt="find the pin code on flat plastic package"                ></p><p>Please look around your home for the package and look on the back for the key. On some older packaging, it could be sealed behind a scratchable region, whereas on other, more recent ones, you might find it unsealed.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/10/how-to-unlock-puk-blocked-sim-card-4.jpg"                      alt="look at the back of the package and find puk code"                ></p><p>In either case, the correct PUK has 8 numbers and should be simple to enter to unlock your SIM card.</p><h3 id="2-Have-it-from-carrier-website"><a href="#2-Have-it-from-carrier-website" class="headerlink" title="2. Have it from carrier website"></a>2. Have it from carrier website</h3><p>In all honesty, I doubt I’ll ever be able to locate my SIM card package again, and I imagine most people feel the same way.</p><p>But happily, a lot of cell companies let you access your account on their app or website to check your SIM card PUK. Please log in to the appropriate website or app, then go to your profile to see whether anything about “PUK” is available there.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/10/how-to-unlock-puk-blocked-sim-card-5.jpg"                      alt="go to career website and check your sim card puk"                ></p><p>It shouldn’t be an issue if you were utilizing or signed in to the platform before your SIM was disabled. However, if not, you might not be able to access anything since you could be asked to input an OTP to verify your identity.</p><p>Please remove the SIM card and try again if you can’t access your phone to utilize the app or website because of the SIM lock. After receiving the PUK code, you can re-insert the SIM and input it.</p><h3 id="3-Contact-your-carrier"><a href="#3-Contact-your-carrier" class="headerlink" title="3. Contact your carrier"></a>3. Contact your carrier</h3><p>It’s time to call customer support, which should be simpler for most individuals if none of the above options work for you. For example, your mobile service provider created your SIM card. Therefore, they have all the information you would require. Before they divulge anything to you, though, they should be able to verify your identity.</p><p>Use a different phone to call your customer service number and describe the issue. And following a series of inquiries, they should offer your PUK number as identification.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/10/how-to-unlock-puk-blocked-sim-card-6.jpg"                      alt="solve the sim card not accessed issue"                ></p><p>However, customer service won’t release the code if you can’t back yourself up. And at that point, there’s probably nothing further you can do. Therefore, make sure you have some information, such as your name, address, date of birth, etc., before you call them.</p><h2 id="Part-4-Easy-Tool-For-Sim-Card-Unlock"><a href="#Part-4-Easy-Tool-For-Sim-Card-Unlock" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: Easy Tool For Sim Card Unlock"></a>Part 4: Easy Tool For Sim Card Unlock</h2><p>If you want to unlock your PUK blocked sim card, you can use a network unlock tool like Dr.Fone.

Having an unlocked device can have its benefits but most of the time most people don’t even know whether their device is SIM locked or not. In this article we are going to address this issue. We are going to begin by helping you find out whether your phone is locked or not and if it is, how you can <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/unlock-android-screen/" >sim unlock <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> the Poco M6 Pro 4G device and enjoy the benefits of an unlocked phone.</p><h2 id="Part-1-How-to-Know-if-your-Android-is-SIM-Locked"><a href="#Part-1-How-to-Know-if-your-Android-is-SIM-Locked" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: How to Know if your Android is SIM Locked"></a>Part 1: How to Know if your Android is SIM Locked</h2><p>It is important to note that not all phones are SIM locked. You can find out if yours is by checking the Poco M6 Pro 4G device’s documentation. If you see the words “unlocked” on the initial receipt then you know that the Poco M6 Pro 4G device is not SIM locked.</p><p>Another easy way to find out is to ask your carrier if the Poco M6 Pro 4G device is locked on to their network. You can also just try inserting another carrier’s SIM into your device. If it doesn’t work, you will know that the Poco M6 Pro 4G device is SIM locked.</p><p>If you bought your device from a third party re-seller such as Amazon you are more likely to be in possession of an unlocked device.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-SIM-Unlock-your-Android-Device"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-SIM-Unlock-your-Android-Device" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to SIM Unlock your Android Device"></a>Part 2: How to SIM Unlock your Android Device</h2><p>If you find that your SIM is locked, here’s a few things you can do to unlock the Poco M6 Pro 4G device.</p><p>Avoid all of the apps on the Google Play Store that promise to unlock your device, most of them don’t work and may even harbour a lot of Trojans and malware that will cause further problems for you and your device.</p><p>There are safe and very legal ways to unlock your device. Just try one of the following.</p><p><strong><em>Ask your Carrier to Unlock your Device</em></strong></p><p>This is the best option when you want to safely unlock your device. By February 2015, American cell phone owners got the option to request their carriers to unlock their device for them. Before that the law didn’t allow for carriers to unlock SIM cards in the United States. This unpopular law was reversed following a similar move by the European Union in 2013. The same law also requires that the carriers inform customers every month whether their device is eligible for unlocking.</p><p>If your device is eligible for unlocking, all you need to do is contact the carrier provide and request for the <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/unlock/unlock-samsung-sim-network-unlock-pin.html" >sim network unlock pin <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. But if your Smartphone was bought on a contract, you may need to pay a termination fee to break the contract of you want to unlock the Poco M6 Pro 4G device before the contact term expires. For Smartphones that are not on contract, you have to wait 12 months from the date of purchase and ensure that your bill is paid before the carrier can give you the unlock code.</p><p><strong><em>How to Unlock your Android Phone</em></strong></p><p>To begin with, you need to confirm your IMEI number. Dial *#06# on your device and the IMEI number will appear on the screen. Copy this number to a secure location or wrote it down somewhere.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2016/06/14670084741192.jpg"                      alt="How to Unlock your Android Phone"                ></p><p>The next step is to find a reputable service that will unlock your Android device for you. This is action you should take only if you are absolutely desperate and your carrier can’t unlock your device for you. This is because many of these sites are unregulated and many of them are not reliable.</p><p>You should also know that many of them will charge a certain amount for your service. You can try <a class="link"   href="https://www.safeunlockcode.com/" >https://www.safeunlockcode.com/ <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> which is one of the more reputable ones we have found.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2016/06/14670084936436.jpg"                      alt="android SIM unlock-safeunlockcode"                ></p><p>You will need to enter the IMEI number as part of the information you need to provide before they can unlock your device.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Troubleshooting-Android-SIM-Unlock"><a href="#Part-3-Troubleshooting-Android-SIM-Unlock" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Troubleshooting Android SIM Unlock"></a>Part 3: Troubleshooting Android SIM Unlock</h2><p>There are lots of issues you may face when you try to unlock your device. The following are just some of the troubleshooting actions you can take if you encounter these problems.</p><p><strong><em>Unlocking Code Fails to work</em></strong></p><p>If you asked your carrier to unlock your device for you, chances are that they sent you a code. If the unlocking code fails to work double check that the IMEI number you used is the correct one and ensure that you purchased that device from that carrier and then try again.</p><p><strong><em>Samsung Device Freezes during unlocking</em></strong></p><p>If your device freezes during the unlocking process it typically means that you entered wrong unlocking code too many times. In this case you need to contact the carrier for a Master Code.</p><p><strong><em>My LG device won’t unlock</em></strong></p><p>There are some LG models that cannot be unlocked. These models include LG U300, LG U310, LG U8180, LG U8330, LG U8120, LG U8360, LG U8380, LGU880, and LG U890. If your device is one of these it can’t be unlocked by your carrier. You may need to look into other ways of unlocking your device.</p><h2 id="The-6-Best-SIM-Unlock-Services-That-Actually-Work-On-Your-Poco-M6-Pro-4G-Device"><a href="#The-6-Best-SIM-Unlock-Services-That-Actually-Work-On-Your-Poco-M6-Pro-4G-Device" class="headerlink" title="The 6 Best SIM Unlock Services That Actually Work On Your Poco M6 Pro 4G Device"></a>The 6 Best SIM Unlock Services That Actually Work On Your Poco M6 Pro 4G Device</h2><p>In our ever-connected world, the need for flexibility and freedom in choosing a mobile service provider is more crucial than ever.

Launch the application and select the “Screen Unlock” tab from the list on the homepage.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/drfone-home.png"                      alt="homepage"                ></p><ul><li>Now, click on the “Remove SIM Locked” tab on the next page. You can only use it to unlock iPhones.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/remove-iphone-sim-1.png"                      alt="screen unlock page"                ></p><ul><li>Connect your iPhone and PC with a USB cable. Once your device is ready, click on the “Start” option to proceed with the sim unlock process.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/remove-iphone-sim-2.png"                      alt="remove sim locks"                ></p><ul><li>Next, the system will detect the Poco C65 device connection, then its information will show up on your PC screen. If all of it is OK, click on the “Unlock Now” option.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/remove-iphone-sim-3.png"                      alt="verify your device"                ></p><ul><li>You cannot unlock your iPhone without a jailbreak, so you must do it before the system unlocks it. You can learn about the jailbreak process via the guide, or watching the video provided by Dr.Fone to jailbreak your iPhone is also feasible. The process is compatible with devices running iOS 12 to iOS 14.8.1.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/remove-iphone-sim-4.png"                      alt="jailbreak instructions"                ></p><ul><li>Now, you have to complete three tasks on your iPhone. First, put the SIM card out of your device. Open “Settings” and tap on the “WIFI” option. Tap on the blue exclamation mark next to all the connected networks and select “Forget This Network.” Now, switch off the “WIFI” and insert the locked SIM card in your iPhone. Click on the “Continue” option on your computer.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/remove-iphone-sim-5.png"                      alt="insert sim card"                ></p><ul><li>After that, Dr.Fone will automatically start the SIM unlocking process. You can see its progress on your PC. The process only takes a few minutes to complete, so you don’t have to wait for a long time.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/remove-iphone-sim-6.png"                      alt="sim unlock progress"                ></p><ul><li>After the process ends, all the sim restrictions on your iOS device are now removed and you can use sim cards from any network carrier. Next, click on the “Done” option to end the sim unlocking process.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/remove-iphone-sim-7.png"                      alt="sim lock removed"                ></p><h2 id="Part-4-Why-is-SIM-Unlocking-Important"><a href="#Part-4-Why-is-SIM-Unlocking-Important" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: Why is SIM Unlocking Important?"></a>Part 4: Why is SIM Unlocking Important?</h2><p>As previously stated, a SIM lock enables a service provider to stop a customer from using the smartphone with the SIM cards of another service provider. This guarantees that the Poco C65 device is only being used with the original SIM card for each provider. This locking also has a lot of drawbacks because it is incompatible with any other SIM card.</p><ol><li>The phone cannot be used with other SIM cards if the SIM lock is enabled. Customers must therefore adhere to the current plan as is.</li><li>Since nobody wants to purchase a locked phone, it is hard for someone to sell or gift the mobile.</li><li>Traveling abroad with a SIM-locked phone could provide some challenges because you won’t be able to use a local SIM card on the phone while you’re there.</li></ol><p>All the problems can be fixed, and the SIM works in any nation with the removed SIM lock.</p><h3 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h3><p>Any of the methods above can work to get around the prohibition against using other SIM cards with your Android handset. The best thing about using Dr.Fone-Screen Unlock is that you don’t need unlocking codes to complete the tasks.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"

Having an unlocked device can have its benefits but most of the time most people don’t even know whether their device is SIM locked or not. In this article we are going to address this issue. We are going to begin by helping you find out whether your phone is locked or not and if it is, how you can <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/unlock-android-screen/" >sim unlock <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> the Poco C55 device and enjoy the benefits of an unlocked phone.</p><h2 id="Part-1-How-to-Know-if-your-Android-is-SIM-Locked"><a href="#Part-1-How-to-Know-if-your-Android-is-SIM-Locked" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: How to Know if your Android is SIM Locked"></a>Part 1: How to Know if your Android is SIM Locked</h2><p>It is important to note that not all phones are SIM locked. You can find out if yours is by checking the Poco C55 device’s documentation.

By February 2015, American cell phone owners got the option to request their carriers to unlock their device for them. Before that the law didn’t allow for carriers to unlock SIM cards in the United States. This unpopular law was reversed following a similar move by the European Union in 2013. The same law also requires that the carriers inform customers every month whether their device is eligible for unlocking.</p><p>If your device is eligible for unlocking, all you need to do is contact the carrier provide and request for the <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/unlock/unlock-samsung-sim-network-unlock-pin.html" >sim network unlock pin <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.

For Smartphones that are not on contract, you have to wait 12 months from the date of purchase and ensure that your bill is paid before the carrier can give you the unlock code.</p><p><strong><em>How to Unlock your Android Phone</em></strong></p><p>To begin with, you need to confirm your IMEI number. Dial *#06# on your device and the IMEI number will appear on the screen. Copy this number to a secure location or wrote it down somewhere.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2016/06/14670084741192.jpg"                      alt="How to Unlock your Android Phone"                ></p><p>The next step is to find a reputable service that will unlock your Android device for you.

The following are just some of the troubleshooting actions you can take if you encounter these problems.</p><p><strong><em>Unlocking Code Fails to work</em></strong></p><p>If you asked your carrier to unlock your device for you, chances are that they sent you a code. If the unlocking code fails to work double check that the IMEI number you used is the correct one and ensure that you purchased that device from that carrier and then try again.</p><p><strong><em>Samsung Device Freezes during unlocking</em></strong></p><p>If your device freezes during the unlocking process it typically means that you entered wrong unlocking code too many times. In this case you need to contact the carrier for a Master Code.</p><p><strong><em>My LG device won’t unlock</em></strong></p><p>There are some LG models that cannot be unlocked. These models include LG U300, LG U310, LG U8180, LG U8330, LG U8120, LG U8360, LG U8380, LGU880, and LG U890. If your device is one of these it can’t be unlocked by your carrier.

Phones are our life source in this global age, it’s our tether to reality, to the world! But if you have a carrier locked phone, then that connection is basically under contract by an external agency! You can’t change your networks, there are limitations on how you use your phone, and when you have to travel abroad you have no option other than paying the roaming charges. If you, say, have an iPhone 5c and have these frustrations, it’s likely you’re already wondering how to unlock the iPhone 5c.</p><p>Chances are that if you’ve had a carrier locked phone for a while, you might have already forgotten what cellular freedom feels like. But we’re here to remind you. All you have to do is break that carrier-lock, and you’re good to go. However, you should be careful when doing so, cause if you try using a jailbreaking technique, it could have major repercussions. So we’re here to give you some valuable advice about how to unlock iPhone 5, iPhone 5c, or even Android phones.</p><h2 id="Part-1-Unlock-SIM-Card-on-Poco-C55-via-jailbreak"><a href="#Part-1-Unlock-SIM-Card-on-Poco-C55-via-jailbreak" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Unlock SIM Card on Poco C55 via jailbreak"></a>Part 1: Unlock SIM Card on Poco C55 via jailbreak</h2><p>Before we get into telling you how to unlock iPhone 5, or the SIM Card on iPhone or Android, we should first tell you what Jailbreaking is. You might have heard of this term before, and I’m sure it sounded ominous to you. Jailbreak? It sounds awfully close to ‘Prison break.’ Well, considering the carrier lock is sort of like a prison for your cell, it is an accurate terminology. But Jailbreak isn’t just about breaking the carrier lock. That might happen as a by-product, but the real purpose is to break free of the software restrictions which are generally applied to Apple devices. This might seem like a good option because, well, who doesn’t want to break free of all of Apple’s restrictions? But that always comes at several heavy risks.</p><h3 id="Threats-of-unlocking-SIM-via-Jailbreak"><a href="#Threats-of-unlocking-SIM-via-Jailbreak" class="headerlink" title="Threats of unlocking SIM via Jailbreak"></a>Threats of unlocking SIM via Jailbreak</h3><h4 id="1-Not-Permanent"><a href="#1-Not-Permanent" class="headerlink" title="1. Not Permanent"></a>1. Not Permanent</h4><p>This has got to be one of the biggest reasons for not jailbreaking your phone. It is not at all permanent! In fact, the moment you update your system, your jailbreak is lost and if you’ve started using a different SIM it will no longer function, and you’re gonna have to go back to using that Carrier you tried so hard to escape from! It’s really not worth the effort. Of course, you could stop updating altogether, but then that will bring us to…</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2016/10/14771444107532.jpg"                      alt="Unlock SIM Card on iPhone and Android via jailbreak"                ></p><h4 id="2-Risky"><a href="#2-Risky" class="headerlink" title="2. Risky"></a>2. Risky</h4><p>If you don’t update your iOS, or Mac or iPad or any device at all, in this day and age, you’re basically just asking to be hacked. That is not to excuse those who do the hacking and plant malware on your system, but if you leave your front door open in a shitty neighborhood, well then you only have yourself to blame once you get robbed!</p><h4 id="3-Warranty"><a href="#3-Warranty" class="headerlink" title="3. Warranty"></a>3. Warranty</h4><p>Jailbreaking has now become kind-of-legal, in a very tenuous sense, but that doesn’t mean Apple wholeheartedly welcomes jailbreaking. If you do so, you will never again be able to avail of the warranty on your phone. And with the kind of major bucks you have to shell out for those iPhones, you best keep that warranty intact.</p><h4 id="4-Lack-of-Apps"><a href="#4-Lack-of-Apps" class="headerlink" title="4. Lack of Apps"></a>4. Lack of Apps</h4><p>Many top-notch and crucial app companies and organizations simply refuse to make their applications usable in jailbreak phones, as they are extremely risky and prone to hacking. As a result, you would have to rely on a bunch of non-professional apps made by amateurs, which is more likely to put your phone in harm’s way.</p><h4 id="5-Bricking"><a href="#5-Bricking" class="headerlink" title="5. Bricking"></a>5. Bricking</h4><p>This basically means your whole system may crash and stop functioning. As a result, you’re gonna’ have to restore the whole thing and try to salvage whatever information you can. Now those who do jailbreak regularly will give you all kinds of excuses like it happens only rarely or that you can retrieve your data simply from the cloud, et al. But do you really want to divest all your time and energy trying to fight off malware, backing up all your data, etc, especially when there is a much more convenient option just around the corner?</p><p>Didn’t think so.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-unlock-SIM-Card-on-iPhone-without-jailbreak-Bonus"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-unlock-SIM-Card-on-iPhone-without-jailbreak-Bonus" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to unlock SIM Card on iPhone without jailbreak[Bonus]"></a>Part 2: How to unlock SIM Card on iPhone without jailbreak[Bonus]</h2><p>As mentioned above, unlocking by jailbreaking is risky and only temporary.

If you have the choice, always opt for email or SMS so that you are able to jot down the right number.</li><li>Once you have gotten the code, insert the new SIM card (from your new carrier). You will receive a prompt to enter your code. Make sure that you key in the right code—entering the wrong code will cause your phone to be locked (possibly forever).</li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2016/08/unlock-screen.jpg"                      alt="sony unlock screen"                ></p><h2 id="Part-4-Poco-C55-Unlock-App-Software"><a href="#Part-4-Poco-C55-Unlock-App-Software" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: Poco C55 Unlock App&#x2F;Software"></a>Part 4: Poco C55 Unlock App&#x2F;Software</h2><p>There are some of us out there who are just not confident with doing things ourselves or trusting our own carrier.</p><p>HOWEVER, if your first instinct is to head to Google Play to look for SIM unlock tools, heed these cautions. There are currently many apps that claim that they can unlock your phone but it is just a scam. You should also avoid torrent files available online. These apps and software are usually laced with Trojans and other types of malware. So do sort through the reviews so that you will not fall into a malicious trap.</p><p>One that we can attest to is  <strong><a class="link"   href="http://mymobileunlocking.com/" >MyMobileUnlocking.com <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong>; it is fast and affordable.

Therefore, if you travel frequently around the world, having an unlocked Poco C55 would be beneficial. Using a local SIM card is much cheaper than paying for exorbitant roaming charges.</p><p>You can also benefit from an unlocked Poco C55 if you are the kind of person who likes to take advantage of current offers provided by your local carriers. Prepaid plans are always changing in terms of offering so having the flexibility of changing carriers and prepaid plans can help you save money in the long run.</p><h2 id="Part-6-The-downside-of-an-unlocked-Poco-C55"><a href="#Part-6-The-downside-of-an-unlocked-Poco-C55" class="headerlink" title="Part 6: The downside of an unlocked Poco C55"></a>Part 6: The downside of an unlocked Poco C55</h2><p>Are you thinking “Well, why can’t I just buy an unlocked Poco C55 in the first place?” right about now? Well, you can but think of the amount of money it will cost you.</p><p>For example, in Australia, an unlocked Poco C55 will cost around $499 from any Poco outlet but $0 for the Poco C55 device when you pair it with a 24-month postpaid plan. While this may look attractive now, you may be paying more for a locked Poco C55 in the long run.</p><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>Now that you know the three ways of unlocking your Poco C55, all you need to do is find one that is most compatible with you. Just remember to think of everything through and carefully. Most importantly, if you have a locked device, always seek advice from your carrier to see if this is possible.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins><br><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://sim-unlock.techidaily.com/in-2024-easily-unlock-your-motorola-edgeplus-2023-device-sim-by-drfone-android/"><u>In 2024, Easily Unlock Your Motorola Edge+ (2023) Device SIM</u></a></li><li><a href="https://sim-unlock.techidaily.com/unlock-your-boost-mobile-apple-iphone-12-mini-before-the-plan-expires-by-drfone-ios/"><u>Unlock Your Boost Mobile Apple iPhone 12 mini Before the Plan Expires</u></a></li><li><a href="https://sim-unlock.techidaily.com/network-locked-sim-card-inserted-on-your-oppo-a1x-5g-phone-unlock-it-now-by-drfone-android/"><u>Network Locked SIM Card Inserted On Your Oppo A1x 5G Phone?

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Easily-Unlock-Your-Poco-C51-Device-SIM"><a href="#Easily-Unlock-Your-Poco-C51-Device-SIM" class="headerlink" title="Easily Unlock Your Poco C51 Device SIM"></a>Easily Unlock Your Poco C51 Device SIM</h2><p>Is your Android phone SIM locked? Having an unlocked device can have its benefits but most of the time most people don’t even know whether their device is SIM locked or not. In this article we are going to address this issue. We are going to begin by helping you find out whether your phone is locked or not and if it is, how you can <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/unlock-android-screen/" >sim unlock <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> the Poco C51 device and enjoy the benefits of an unlocked phone.</p><h2 id="Part-1-How-to-Know-if-your-Android-is-SIM-Locked"><a href="#Part-1-How-to-Know-if-your-Android-is-SIM-Locked" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: How to Know if your Android is SIM Locked"></a>Part 1: How to Know if your Android is SIM Locked</h2><p>It is important to note that not all phones are SIM locked. You can find out if yours is by checking the Poco C51 device’s documentation. If you see the words “unlocked” on the initial receipt then you know that the Poco C51 device is not SIM locked.</p><p>Another easy way to find out is to ask your carrier if the Poco C51 device is locked on to their network. You can also just try inserting another carrier’s SIM into your device. If it doesn’t work, you will know that the Poco C51 device is SIM locked.</p><p>If you bought your device from a third party re-seller such as Amazon you are more likely to be in possession of an unlocked device.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-SIM-Unlock-your-Android-Device"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-SIM-Unlock-your-Android-Device" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to SIM Unlock your Android Device"></a>Part 2: How to SIM Unlock your Android Device</h2><p>If you find that your SIM is locked, here’s a few things you can do to unlock the Poco C51 device.</p><p>Avoid all of the apps on the Google Play Store that promise to unlock your device, most of them don’t work and may even harbour a lot of Trojans and malware that will cause further problems for you and your device.</p><p>There are safe and very legal ways to unlock your device. Just try one of the following.</p><p><strong><em>Ask your Carrier to Unlock your Device</em></strong></p><p>This is the best option when you want to safely unlock your device. By February 2015, American cell phone owners got the option to request their carriers to unlock their device for them. Before that the law didn’t allow for carriers to unlock SIM cards in the United States. This unpopular law was reversed following a similar move by the European Union in 2013. The same law also requires that the carriers inform customers every month whether their device is eligible for unlocking.</p><p>If your device is eligible for unlocking, all you need to do is contact the carrier provide and request for the <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/unlock/unlock-samsung-sim-network-unlock-pin.html" >sim network unlock pin <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. But if your Smartphone was bought on a contract, you may need to pay a termination fee to break the contract of you want to unlock the Poco C51 device before the contact term expires. For Smartphones that are not on contract, you have to wait 12 months from the date of purchase and ensure that your bill is paid before the carrier can give you the unlock code.</p><p><strong><em>How to Unlock your Android Phone</em></strong></p><p>To begin with, you need to confirm your IMEI number. Dial *#06# on your device and the IMEI number will appear on the screen. Copy this number to a secure location or wrote it down somewhere.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2016/06/14670084741192.jpg"                      alt="How to Unlock your Android Phone"                ></p><p>The next step is to find a reputable service that will unlock your Android device for you. This is action you should take only if you are absolutely desperate and your carrier can’t unlock your device for you. This is because many of these sites are unregulated and many of them are not reliable.</p><p>You should also know that many of them will charge a certain amount for your service. You can try <a class="link"   href="https://www.safeunlockcode.com/" >https://www.safeunlockcode.com/ <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> which is one of the more reputable ones we have found.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2016/06/14670084936436.jpg"                      alt="android SIM unlock-safeunlockcode"                ></p><p>You will need to enter the IMEI number as part of the information you need to provide before they can unlock your device.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Troubleshooting-Android-SIM-Unlock"><a href="#Part-3-Troubleshooting-Android-SIM-Unlock" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Troubleshooting Android SIM Unlock"></a>Part 3: Troubleshooting Android SIM Unlock</h2><p>There are lots of issues you may face when you try to unlock your device. The following are just some of the troubleshooting actions you can take if you encounter these problems.</p><p><strong><em>Unlocking Code Fails to work</em></strong></p><p>If you asked your carrier to unlock your device for you, chances are that they sent you a code. If the unlocking code fails to work double check that the IMEI number you used is the correct one and ensure that you purchased that device from that carrier and then try again.</p><p><strong><em>Samsung Device Freezes during unlocking</em></strong></p><p>If your device freezes during the unlocking process it typically means that you entered wrong unlocking code too many times. In this case you need to contact the carrier for a Master Code.</p><p><strong><em>My LG device won’t unlock</em></strong></p><p>There are some LG models that cannot be unlocked. These models include LG U300, LG U310, LG U8180, LG U8330, LG U8120, LG U8360, LG U8380, LGU880, and LG U890. If your device is one of these it can’t be unlocked by your carrier. You may need to look into other ways of unlocking your device.</p><h2 id="What-Is-a-SIM-Network-Unlock-PIN-Get-Your-Poco-C51-Phone-Network-Ready"><a href="#What-Is-a-SIM-Network-Unlock-PIN-Get-Your-Poco-C51-Phone-Network-Ready" class="headerlink" title="What Is a SIM Network Unlock PIN?

You might miss out on better deals, struggle with roaming charges abroad, or feel inconvenienced by limited coverage. And you can’t avoid these things without the right <strong>SIM network unlock PIN</strong>.</p><p>That’s why we’ve created this comprehensive guide to help you unlock your phone’s potential. This article will explain what a <strong>SIM network unlock PIN</strong> is, the process involved, and answer any questions you might have. Keep scrolling to learn more.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/02/sim-network-unlock-pin-01.jpg"                      alt="enter sim network unlock pin"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-Why-Is-Your-Poco-C51-Asking-for-a-SIM-Network-Unlock-PIN"><a href="#Part-1-Why-Is-Your-Poco-C51-Asking-for-a-SIM-Network-Unlock-PIN" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Why Is Your Poco C51 Asking for a SIM Network Unlock PIN?"></a>Part 1: Why Is Your Poco C51 Asking for a SIM Network Unlock PIN?</h2><p>You just bought a new phone, excited to use it with a new SIM card. But your phone pops up with a request for a PIN code to unlock it. What’s that all about, and what do you enter? There are two main reasons why your phone might be asking for a SIM PIN or unlock code:</p><p>SIM Network Lock</p><p>The SIM Network Lock is a restriction placed by your phone’s original network provider, locking it to their network. It means you can only use the Poco C51 device with SIM cards from that specific carrier. Carriers use this to ensure that the phones they sell work only with their service. When you buy a subsidized phone, they want to ensure you stick around for the contract duration.</p><p>If you insert a SIM card from a different carrier, your phone will ask for a <strong>SIM Network Unlock PIN</strong> or Network Unlock Code (NUC). You’ll learn more about it in the upcoming sections of this article.</p><p>SIM Card Lock</p><p>SIM Card Lock is a security feature that protects your SIM card from unauthorized use on other devices. It requires you to enter a PIN (Personal Identification Number) to unlock the SIM card before you can use it.</p><p>The default PIN is usually printed on the back of the SIM card or its packaging. If you haven’t changed your PIN, use the 4-8 digit code provided by the carrier when you get your SIM card.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/02/sim-network-unlock-pin-02.jpg"                      alt="sim card lock pin"                ></p><p>If you’ve forgotten the <strong>SIM PIN code</strong>, you can use the PUK (PIN Unlock Key) code to unlock the SIM and set a new PIN. The PUK code is also printed on the SIM card packaging, but be careful, as entering the wrong PUK code too many times can permanently lock the SIM card.</p><p>Not knowing the <strong>SIM unlock PIN</strong> code can be frustrating, especially if you want to switch mobile carriers. So, in the next part, we’ll explore whether it’s possible to unlock a SIM network-locked iPhone device.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Can-a-SIM-Network-Locked-iPhone-Be-Unlocked"><a href="#Part-2-Can-a-SIM-Network-Locked-iPhone-Be-Unlocked" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Can a SIM Network Locked iPhone Be Unlocked?"></a>Part 2: Can a SIM Network Locked iPhone Be Unlocked?</h2><p>Yes, a SIM network-locked iPhone can be unlocked by your network provider. Insert a new SIM card, and you’ll be prompted to enter the <strong>SIM Network Unlock PIN</strong>. After inputting the correct unlock code, your iPhone is ready to use with any carrier.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/02/sim-network-unlock-pin-03.jpg"                      alt="sim not valid message on iphone"                ></p><p>If you are thinking about unlocking your iPhone, it’s crucial to grasp what a <strong>SIM Network Unlock PIN</strong> is and how it functions.</p><h2 id="Part-3-What-Is-a-SIM-Network-Unlock-PIN"><a href="#Part-3-What-Is-a-SIM-Network-Unlock-PIN" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: What Is a SIM Network Unlock PIN?"></a>Part 3: What Is a SIM Network Unlock PIN?</h2><p>A <strong>SIM network unlock PIN</strong> is a code allowing you to remove your phone’s network lock. It means you can use your phone with a SIM card from any compatible network provider, not just the one you originally bought it from. It is also known as Network Unlock PIN (NUP), Network Control Key (NCK), or Network Unlock Code (NUC).</p><p>Unlocking your device can be useful if you:</p><ul><li>Bought a phone locked to a specific carrier and want to switch to a different one.</li><li>Are planning a trip abroad and want to use a local SIM card instead.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/02/sim-network-unlock-pin-04.jpg"                      alt="international travel illustration"                ></p><ul><li>Still haven’t finished your contract with your original carrier and want to keep the phone but use a different service.</li><li>Bought a phone second-hand locked to the previous owner’s network.</li><li>Want to increase your phone’s resale value; unlocked phones generally have a higher resale value than locked phones, as various buyers can use them.</li><li>Want more carrier flexibility; you are not tied to one carrier and can choose the provider that best suits your needs in terms of price, coverage, data plans, and other features.</li></ul><p>Things To Consider</p><p>Before you proceed, here are some key points to remember:</p><ul><li>Eligibility: Not all phones are eligible for network unlocking. Check with your carrier or manufacturer for details.</li><li>Costs: While some carriers can give <strong>SIM network unlock PIN for free</strong>, others may charge a fee. Third-party unlocking services also typically charge a fee.</li><li>Waiting time: It can take days or even weeks to receive your <strong>SIM unlock PIN</strong>code from your carrier and process it. For instance, Vodafone usually unlocks the Poco C51 device within 72 hours to 10 days if they have to reach the manufacturer.</li><li>Risks: Using an unauthorized unlocking method could damage your phone or void its warranty.</li><li>Backup: Before unlocking your phone, back up your data, as the process may erase it.</li></ul><p>Now that you understand <strong>SIM Network Unlock PIN</strong>, let’s get down to business! In the final part, we’ll guide you through the two ways of unlocking your iPhone for a new carrier.</p><h2 id="Part-4-How-To-Unlock-Your-iPhone-for-a-New-Carrier"><a href="#Part-4-How-To-Unlock-Your-iPhone-for-a-New-Carrier" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: How To Unlock Your iPhone for a New Carrier?"></a>Part 4: How To Unlock Your iPhone for a New Carrier?</h2><p>Ready to unlock your iPhone and explore your carrier options?

Using a local SIM card is much cheaper than paying for exorbitant roaming charges.</p><p>You can also benefit from an unlocked Poco C51 if you are the kind of person who likes to take advantage of current offers provided by your local carriers.
