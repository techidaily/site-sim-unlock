You might miss out on better deals, struggle with roaming charges abroad, or feel inconvenienced by limited coverage. And you can’t avoid these things without the right <strong>SIM network unlock PIN</strong>.</p><p>That’s why we’ve created this comprehensive guide to help you unlock your phone’s potential. This article will explain what a <strong>SIM network unlock PIN</strong> is, the process involved, and answer any questions you might have. Keep scrolling to learn more.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/02/sim-network-unlock-pin-01.jpg"                      alt="enter sim network unlock pin"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-Why-Is-Your-Itel-P55T-Asking-for-a-SIM-Network-Unlock-PIN"><a href="#Part-1-Why-Is-Your-Itel-P55T-Asking-for-a-SIM-Network-Unlock-PIN" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Why Is Your Itel P55T Asking for a SIM Network Unlock PIN?"></a>Part 1: Why Is Your Itel P55T Asking for a SIM Network Unlock PIN?</h2><p>You just bought a new phone, excited to use it with a new SIM card. But your phone pops up with a request for a PIN code to unlock it. What’s that all about, and what do you enter? There are two main reasons why your phone might be asking for a SIM PIN or unlock code:</p><p>SIM Network Lock</p><p>The SIM Network Lock is a restriction placed by your phone’s original network provider, locking it to their network. It means you can only use the Itel P55T device with SIM cards from that specific carrier. Carriers use this to ensure that the phones they sell work only with their service. When you buy a subsidized phone, they want to ensure you stick around for the contract duration.</p><p>If you insert a SIM card from a different carrier, your phone will ask for a <strong>SIM Network Unlock PIN</strong> or Network Unlock Code (NUC). You’ll learn more about it in the upcoming sections of this article.</p><p>SIM Card Lock</p><p>SIM Card Lock is a security feature that protects your SIM card from unauthorized use on other devices. It requires you to enter a PIN (Personal Identification Number) to unlock the SIM card before you can use it.</p><p>The default PIN is usually printed on the back of the SIM card or its packaging. If you haven’t changed your PIN, use the 4-8 digit code provided by the carrier when you get your SIM card.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/02/sim-network-unlock-pin-02.jpg"                      alt="sim card lock pin"                ></p><p>If you’ve forgotten the <strong>SIM PIN code</strong>, you can use the PUK (PIN Unlock Key) code to unlock the SIM and set a new PIN. The PUK code is also printed on the SIM card packaging, but be careful, as entering the wrong PUK code too many times can permanently lock the SIM card.</p><p>Not knowing the <strong>SIM unlock PIN</strong> code can be frustrating, especially if you want to switch mobile carriers. So, in the next part, we’ll explore whether it’s possible to unlock a SIM network-locked iPhone device.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Can-a-SIM-Network-Locked-iPhone-Be-Unlocked"><a href="#Part-2-Can-a-SIM-Network-Locked-iPhone-Be-Unlocked" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Can a SIM Network Locked iPhone Be Unlocked?"></a>Part 2: Can a SIM Network Locked iPhone Be Unlocked?</h2><p>Yes, a SIM network-locked iPhone can be unlocked by your network provider. Insert a new SIM card, and you’ll be prompted to enter the <strong>SIM Network Unlock PIN</strong>. After inputting the correct unlock code, your iPhone is ready to use with any carrier.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/02/sim-network-unlock-pin-03.jpg"                      alt="sim not valid message on iphone"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2068439/7443" target="_top" id="2068439">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2068439" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2068439/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>If you are thinking about unlocking your iPhone, it’s crucial to grasp what a <strong>SIM Network Unlock PIN</strong> is and how it functions.</p><h2 id="Part-3-What-Is-a-SIM-Network-Unlock-PIN"><a href="#Part-3-What-Is-a-SIM-Network-Unlock-PIN" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: What Is a SIM Network Unlock PIN?"></a>Part 3: What Is a SIM Network Unlock PIN?</h2><p>A <strong>SIM network unlock PIN</strong> is a code allowing you to remove your phone’s network lock. It means you can use your phone with a SIM card from any compatible network provider, not just the one you originally bought it from. It is also known as Network Unlock PIN (NUP), Network Control Key (NCK), or Network Unlock Code (NUC).</p><p>Unlocking your device can be useful if you:</p><ul><li>Bought a phone locked to a specific carrier and want to switch to a different one.</li><li>Are planning a trip abroad and want to use a local SIM card instead.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/02/sim-network-unlock-pin-04.jpg"                      alt="international travel illustration"                ></p><ul><li>Still haven’t finished your contract with your original carrier and want to keep the phone but use a different service.</li><li>Bought a phone second-hand locked to the previous owner’s network.</li><li>Want to increase your phone’s resale value; unlocked phones generally have a higher resale value than locked phones, as various buyers can use them.</li><li>Want more carrier flexibility; you are not tied to one carrier and can choose the provider that best suits your needs in terms of price, coverage, data plans, and other features.</li></ul><p>Things To Consider</p><p>Before you proceed, here are some key points to remember:</p><ul><li>Eligibility: Not all phones are eligible for network unlocking. Check with your carrier or manufacturer for details.</li><li>Costs: While some carriers can give <strong>SIM network unlock PIN for free</strong>, others may charge a fee. Third-party unlocking services also typically charge a fee.</li><li>Waiting time: It can take days or even weeks to receive your <strong>SIM unlock PIN</strong>code from your carrier and process it. For instance, Vodafone usually unlocks the Itel P55T device within 72 hours to 10 days if they have to reach the manufacturer.</li><li>Risks: Using an unauthorized unlocking method could damage your phone or void its warranty.</li><li>Backup: Before unlocking your phone, back up your data, as the process may erase it.</li></ul><p>Now that you understand <strong>SIM Network Unlock PIN</strong>, let’s get down to business!

Phones are our life source in this global age, it’s our tether to reality, to the world! But if you have a carrier locked phone, then that connection is basically under contract by an external agency! You can’t change your networks, there are limitations on how you use your phone, and when you have to travel abroad you have no option other than paying the roaming charges. If you, say, have an iPhone 5c and have these frustrations, it’s likely you’re already wondering how to unlock the iPhone 5c.</p><p>Chances are that if you’ve had a carrier locked phone for a while, you might have already forgotten what cellular freedom feels like. But we’re here to remind you. All you have to do is break that carrier-lock, and you’re good to go. However, you should be careful when doing so, cause if you try using a jailbreaking technique, it could have major repercussions. So we’re here to give you some valuable advice about how to unlock iPhone 5, iPhone 5c, or even Android phones.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2123512/26400" target="_top" id="2123512">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2123512" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/i/5597632/2123512/26400"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-1-Unlock-SIM-Card-on-Xiaomi-Redmi-A2-via-jailbreak"><a href="#Part-1-Unlock-SIM-Card-on-Xiaomi-Redmi-A2-via-jailbreak" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Unlock SIM Card on Xiaomi Redmi A2 via jailbreak"></a>Part 1: Unlock SIM Card on Xiaomi Redmi A2 via jailbreak</h2><p>Before we get into telling you how to unlock iPhone 5, or the SIM Card on iPhone or Android, we should first tell you what Jailbreaking is. You might have heard of this term before, and I’m sure it sounded ominous to you. Jailbreak? It sounds awfully close to ‘Prison break.’ Well, considering the carrier lock is sort of like a prison for your cell, it is an accurate terminology. But Jailbreak isn’t just about breaking the carrier lock. That might happen as a by-product, but the real purpose is to break free of the software restrictions which are generally applied to Apple devices. This might seem like a good option because, well, who doesn’t want to break free of all of Apple’s restrictions? But that always comes at several heavy risks.</p><h3 id="Threats-of-unlocking-SIM-via-Jailbreak"><a href="#Threats-of-unlocking-SIM-via-Jailbreak" class="headerlink" title="Threats of unlocking SIM via Jailbreak"></a>Threats of unlocking SIM via Jailbreak</h3><h4 id="1-Not-Permanent"><a href="#1-Not-Permanent" class="headerlink" title="1. Not Permanent"></a>1. Not Permanent</h4><p>This has got to be one of the biggest reasons for not jailbreaking your phone. It is not at all permanent! In fact, the moment you update your system, your jailbreak is lost and if you’ve started using a different SIM it will no longer function, and you’re gonna have to go back to using that Carrier you tried so hard to escape from! It’s really not worth the effort. Of course, you could stop updating altogether, but then that will bring us to…</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2016/10/14771444107532.jpg"                      alt="Unlock SIM Card on iPhone and Android via jailbreak"                ></p><h4 id="2-Risky"><a href="#2-Risky" class="headerlink" title="2. Risky"></a>2. Risky</h4><p>If you don’t update your iOS, or Mac or iPad or any device at all, in this day and age, you’re basically just asking to be hacked. That is not to excuse those who do the hacking and plant malware on your system, but if you leave your front door open in a shitty neighborhood, well then you only have yourself to blame once you get robbed!</p><h4 id="3-Warranty"><a href="#3-Warranty" class="headerlink" title="3. Warranty"></a>3. Warranty</h4><p>Jailbreaking has now become kind-of-legal, in a very tenuous sense, but that doesn’t mean Apple wholeheartedly welcomes jailbreaking. If you do so, you will never again be able to avail of the warranty on your phone. And with the kind of major bucks you have to shell out for those iPhones, you best keep that warranty intact.</p><h4 id="4-Lack-of-Apps"><a href="#4-Lack-of-Apps" class="headerlink" title="4. Lack of Apps"></a>4. Lack of Apps</h4><p>Many top-notch and crucial app companies and organizations simply refuse to make their applications usable in jailbreak phones, as they are extremely risky and prone to hacking. As a result, you would have to rely on a bunch of non-professional apps made by amateurs, which is more likely to put your phone in harm’s way.</p><h4 id="5-Bricking"><a href="#5-Bricking" class="headerlink" title="5. Bricking"></a>5. Bricking</h4><p>This basically means your whole system may crash and stop functioning. As a result, you’re gonna’ have to restore the whole thing and try to salvage whatever information you can. Now those who do jailbreak regularly will give you all kinds of excuses like it happens only rarely or that you can retrieve your data simply from the cloud, et al. But do you really want to divest all your time and energy trying to fight off malware, backing up all your data, etc, especially when there is a much more convenient option just around the corner?</p><p>Didn’t think so.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-unlock-SIM-Card-on-iPhone-without-jailbreak-Bonus"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-unlock-SIM-Card-on-iPhone-without-jailbreak-Bonus" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to unlock SIM Card on iPhone without jailbreak[Bonus]"></a>Part 2: How to unlock SIM Card on iPhone without jailbreak[Bonus]</h2><p>As mentioned above, unlocking by jailbreaking is risky and only temporary.

One of the main reasons people want to change their Android IMEI number is to unblock a device that has been blacklisted by their network provider. Other reasons include accessing certain network features and services or maintaining anonymity.</p><p>Changing your Android IMEI without root access may seem like a daunting task, but this comprehensive guide will walk you through the process step-by-step.

Users can block stolen or lost devices for further usage if they know their IMEI number. All users need to call their network carrier and report that the Itel A05s device is stolen or lost. The carrier can block the specific device from running on their network and notify other carriers.</li><li>The 15-digit IMEI number indicates the origin and model of the Itel A05s device. The first eight digits indicate the Itel A05s device’s origin and its model while the last six digits identify the Itel A05s device’s manufacturer.</li><li>If you subscribe to a mobile tracking service, you can use the IMEI number to track the Itel A05s device—even if it uses a different SIM card.</li></ol><h3 id="Pros-and-Cons-of-Changing-Android-IMEI"><a href="#Pros-and-Cons-of-Changing-Android-IMEI" class="headerlink" title="Pros and Cons of Changing Android IMEI"></a>Pros and Cons of Changing Android IMEI</h3><p>Like many other things out there, changing Android IMEI has both advantages and disadvantages.

Once you change your IMEI, your Android device with the same benefits and features.</li><li>Obtaining a completely new device ID.</li><li>Changing the IMEI number to one that indicates it is a newer model, you will be able to enjoy new OS updates by resetting, repairing, and updating your Android device.</li><li>Have you ever yearned for that cheap BlackBerry plan your network carrier keeps on promoting? The 15-digit IMEI indicates the origin and model of your device. Therefore, by changing your Android’s IMEI number to that of a BlackBerry’s, you will be able to subscribe to a cheaper mobile plan.</li></ol><p><strong>Disadvantages</strong></p><ol><li>Before we begin, we need to make it clear that the process of changing IMEI without root can be illegal in some countries. We advise you to check the laws and regulations in your country before attempting to change your device’s IMEI number. As far as we know, it is legal in Africa and Asia, and illegal in Europe.</li><li>The IMEI number is hardcoded into your device. Therefore, changing your device’s IMEI number may void your device warranty and cause other issues such as network problems and software instability.</li><li>Legally, you have forfeited your ownership of your mobile device. When you purchase your device, the seller will jot down the original IMEI number on your receipt. So if you changed your IMEI and lost it, you may not be able to claim it. This is because authorities cannot see if it is truly yours. After all, the IMEI numbers no longer correlate with each other.</li></ol><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Find-the-IMEI-on-an-Android-5-Ways"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Find-the-IMEI-on-an-Android-5-Ways" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Find the IMEI on an Android?

The IMEI is a unique identifier assigned to the hardware of the Itel A05s device. It remains constant throughout the life of the Itel A05s device, irrespective of any software changes or resets.</p><p>A factory reset wipes the data and settings on your device, returning it to its original factory state.

It is typically printed on the Itel A05s device’s packaging or can be found by dialing *#06# on the phone’s keypad. It’s a crucial identifier for mobile networks, and authorities use it to uniquely identify and track devices across networks. It remains unchanged even after a factory reset.</p><h2 id="Part-5-Requirements-for-Changing-Android-IMEI-without-Root"><a href="#Part-5-Requirements-for-Changing-Android-IMEI-without-Root" class="headerlink" title="Part 5: Requirements for Changing Android IMEI without Root"></a>Part 5: Requirements for Changing Android IMEI without Root</h2><p>Before you begin the process of changing your Android IMEI without root, there are a few things you will need:</p><ul><li><strong>A compatible Android device:</strong> The methods detailed in this guide are specifically for MediaTek (MTK) devices.

But your phone pops up with a request for a PIN code to unlock it. What’s that all about, and what do you enter? There are two main reasons why your phone might be asking for a SIM PIN or unlock code:</p><p>SIM Network Lock</p><p>The SIM Network Lock is a restriction placed by your phone’s original network provider, locking it to their network. It means you can only use the Xiaomi 14 device with SIM cards from that specific carrier. Carriers use this to ensure that the phones they sell work only with their service. When you buy a subsidized phone, they want to ensure you stick around for the contract duration.</p><p>If you insert a SIM card from a different carrier, your phone will ask for a <strong>SIM Network Unlock PIN</strong> or Network Unlock Code (NUC). You’ll learn more about it in the upcoming sections of this article.</p><p>SIM Card Lock</p><p>SIM Card Lock is a security feature that protects your SIM card from unauthorized use on other devices. It requires you to enter a PIN (Personal Identification Number) to unlock the SIM card before you can use it.</p><p>The default PIN is usually printed on the back of the SIM card or its packaging. If you haven’t changed your PIN, use the 4-8 digit code provided by the carrier when you get your SIM card.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/02/sim-network-unlock-pin-02.jpg"                      alt="sim card lock pin"                ></p><p>If you’ve forgotten the <strong>SIM PIN code</strong>, you can use the PUK (PIN Unlock Key) code to unlock the SIM and set a new PIN. The PUK code is also printed on the SIM card packaging, but be careful, as entering the wrong PUK code too many times can permanently lock the SIM card.</p><p>Not knowing the <strong>SIM unlock PIN</strong> code can be frustrating, especially if you want to switch mobile carriers.

Third-party unlocking services also typically charge a fee.</li><li>Waiting time: It can take days or even weeks to receive your <strong>SIM unlock PIN</strong>code from your carrier and process it.

Phones are our life source in this global age, it’s our tether to reality, to the world! But if you have a carrier locked phone, then that connection is basically under contract by an external agency! You can’t change your networks, there are limitations on how you use your phone, and when you have to travel abroad you have no option other than paying the roaming charges. If you, say, have an iPhone 5c and have these frustrations, it’s likely you’re already wondering how to unlock the Apple iPhone 15 Plus 5c.</p><p>Chances are that if you’ve had a carrier locked phone for a while, you might have already forgotten what cellular freedom feels like. But we’re here to remind you. All you have to do is break that carrier-lock, and you’re good to go. However, you should be careful when doing so, cause if you try using a jailbreaking technique, it could have major repercussions. So we’re here to give you some valuable advice about how to unlock iPhone 5, iPhone 5c, or even Android phones.</p><h2 id="Part-1-Unlock-SIM-Card-on-iPhone-and-Android-via-jailbreak"><a href="#Part-1-Unlock-SIM-Card-on-iPhone-and-Android-via-jailbreak" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Unlock SIM Card on iPhone and Android via jailbreak"></a>Part 1: Unlock SIM Card on iPhone and Android via jailbreak</h2><p>Before we get into telling you how to unlock iPhone 5, or the SIM Card on iPhone or Android, we should first tell you what Jailbreaking is. You might have heard of this term before, and I’m sure it sounded ominous to you. Jailbreak? It sounds awfully close to ‘Prison break.’ Well, considering the carrier lock is sort of like a prison for your cell, it is an accurate terminology. But Jailbreak isn’t just about breaking the carrier lock. That might happen as a by-product, but the real purpose is to break free of the software restrictions which are generally applied to Apple devices. This might seem like a good option because, well, who doesn’t want to break free of all of Apple’s restrictions? But that always comes at several heavy risks.</p><h3 id="Threats-of-unlocking-SIM-via-Jailbreak"><a href="#Threats-of-unlocking-SIM-via-Jailbreak" class="headerlink" title="Threats of unlocking SIM via Jailbreak"></a>Threats of unlocking SIM via Jailbreak</h3><h4 id="1-Not-Permanent"><a href="#1-Not-Permanent" class="headerlink" title="1. Not Permanent"></a>1. Not Permanent</h4><p>This has got to be one of the biggest reasons for not jailbreaking your phone. It is not at all permanent! In fact, the moment you update your system, your jailbreak is lost and if you’ve started using a different SIM it will no longer function, and you’re gonna have to go back to using that Carrier you tried so hard to escape from! It’s really not worth the effort. Of course, you could stop updating altogether, but then that will bring us to…</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2016/10/14771444107532.jpg"                      alt="Unlock SIM Card on iPhone and Android via jailbreak"                ></p><h4 id="2-Risky"><a href="#2-Risky" class="headerlink" title="2. Risky"></a>2. Risky</h4><p>If you don’t update your iOS, or Mac or iPad or any device at all, in this day and age, you’re basically just asking to be hacked. That is not to excuse those who do the hacking and plant malware on your system, but if you leave your front door open in a shitty neighborhood, well then you only have yourself to blame once you get robbed!</p><h4 id="3-Warranty"><a href="#3-Warranty" class="headerlink" title="3. Warranty"></a>3. Warranty</h4><p>Jailbreaking has now become kind-of-legal, in a very tenuous sense, but that doesn’t mean Apple wholeheartedly welcomes jailbreaking. If you do so, you will never again be able to avail of the warranty on your phone. And with the kind of major bucks you have to shell out for those iPhones, you best keep that warranty intact.</p><h4 id="4-Lack-of-Apps"><a href="#4-Lack-of-Apps" class="headerlink" title="4. Lack of Apps"></a>4. Lack of Apps</h4><p>Many top-notch and crucial app companies and organizations simply refuse to make their applications usable in jailbreak phones, as they are extremely risky and prone to hacking. As a result, you would have to rely on a bunch of non-professional apps made by amateurs, which is more likely to put your phone in harm’s way.</p><h4 id="5-Bricking"><a href="#5-Bricking" class="headerlink" title="5. Bricking"></a>5. Bricking</h4><p>This basically means your whole system may crash and stop functioning. As a result, you’re gonna’ have to restore the whole thing and try to salvage whatever information you can. Now those who do jailbreak regularly will give you all kinds of excuses like it happens only rarely or that you can retrieve your data simply from the cloud, et al. But do you really want to divest all your time and energy trying to fight off malware, backing up all your data, etc, especially when there is a much more convenient option just around the corner?</p><p>Didn’t think so.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1498635">                    <video width="320" height="320" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1498635.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17326-1498635">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1498635.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:200px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Fancheer.sjv.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1498635%2F17326'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1498635/17326"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-unlock-SIM-Card-on-iPhone-without-jailbreak-Bonus"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-unlock-SIM-Card-on-iPhone-without-jailbreak-Bonus" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to unlock SIM Card on iPhone without jailbreak[Bonus]"></a>Part 2: How to unlock SIM Card on iPhone without jailbreak[Bonus]</h2><p>As mentioned above, unlocking by jailbreaking is risky and only temporary.

Unlike ESN, an IMEI number is 15 digits long. It serves as an anti-theft measure, meaning a blacklisted IMEI can result from a device being reported lost or stolen or a breach of the consumer agreement.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/iphone-imei-check.jpg"                      alt="iPhone imei number check"                ></p><h3 id="What-is-an-ESN"><a href="#What-is-an-ESN" class="headerlink" title="What is an ESN?"></a>What is an ESN?</h3><p>Electronic Serial Number (ESN): Previously utilized by CDMA (Code Division Multiple Access) networks, an ESN was a unique identifier for cellular devices. With technological progression, most carriers have shifted their focus to the IMEI system, but knowing your ESN’s history is still crucial, especially if you’re dealing with older devices.</p><h3 id="What-is-a-Bad-ESN"><a href="#What-is-a-Bad-ESN" class="headerlink" title="What is a Bad ESN?"></a>What is a Bad ESN?</h3><p>A Bad ESN can mean a lot of things, let’s check out some examples:</p><ol><li>If you hear this term most probably you are trying to activate the Apple iPhone 15 Plus device with a carrier, but that’s not possible due to some reasons.</li><li>It can mean that the previous owner of the Apple iPhone 15 Plus device switched carriers.</li><li>The previous owner had an outstanding amount on their bill and cancelled the account without paying the bill first.</li><li>The previous owner didn’t have a bill when they cancelled the account but they were still under a contract and if you cancel sooner than the due date for the contract, an “early termination fee” is created based on the remaining period of the contract and they hadn’t paid that amount.</li><li>The person that sold you the phone or someone else who was the actual owner of the Apple iPhone 15 Plus device reported the Apple iPhone 15 Plus device as lost or stolen.</li></ol><h3 id="What-is-a-blacklisted-IMEI"><a href="#What-is-a-blacklisted-IMEI" class="headerlink" title="What is a blacklisted IMEI?"></a>What is a blacklisted IMEI?</h3><p>Blacklisted IMEI is basically the same thing as Bad ESN but for devices that work on CDMA networks, like Verizon or Sprint. In short, the main reason that a device has a Blacklisted IMEI is so that you as the owner or someone else cannot activate the Apple iPhone 15 Plus device on any carrier, not even the original one, thus avoiding selling or stealing the phone.</p><p><strong>You Might Be Interested In:</strong></p><ol><li><a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/backup-iphone/backup-iphone-to-itunes.html" >Ultimate Guide to Backing Up iPhone With&#x2F;Without iTunes <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li><li><a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/unlock/unlock-disabled-iphone-without-itunes.html" >3 Ways to Unlock A Disabled iPhone Without iTunes <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li><li><a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/unlock/unlock-iphone-passcode.html" >How to Unlock iPhone Passcode With or Without iTunes? <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li></ol><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-check-if-your-Apple-iPhone-15-Plus-is-blacklisted"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-check-if-your-Apple-iPhone-15-Plus-is-blacklisted" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to check if your Apple iPhone 15 Plus is blacklisted?"></a>Part 2: How to check if your Apple iPhone 15 Plus is blacklisted?</h2><p>In order to check if an iPhone is blacklisted, you need to first <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/unlock/imei-check-iphone.html" >retrieve your IMEI <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> or ESN number to check if it’s blacklisted.</p><h3 id="How-to-find-the-IMEI-or-ESN-numbers"><a href="#How-to-find-the-IMEI-or-ESN-numbers" class="headerlink" title="How to find the IMEI or ESN numbers"></a>How to find the IMEI or ESN numbers</h3><ol><li>On the original box of the iPhone, usually around the barcode.</li><li>In Settings, if you go to General &gt; About, you can find the IMEI or ESN.</li><li>On some iPhones, it’s in the SIM card tray when you pull it out.</li><li>Some iPhones have it engraved on the back of the case.</li><li>If you dial *#06# on your dial pad you will get the IMEI or ESN.</li></ol><h3 id="How-to-verify-if-your-Apple-iPhone-15-Plus-is-blacklisted"><a href="#How-to-verify-if-your-Apple-iPhone-15-Plus-is-blacklisted" class="headerlink" title="How to verify if your Apple iPhone 15 Plus is blacklisted?"></a>How to verify if your Apple iPhone 15 Plus is blacklisted?</h3><p>Checking if your Apple iPhone 15 Plus has a blacklisted IMEI is the first step in addressing the issue.

Most of them also come factory unlocked as well.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/10-things-you-can-do-with-an-iphone-that-has-bad-esn-or-blacklisted-iemi-13.jpg"                      alt="iPhone 6s bad esn"                ></p><p>Having a phone with bad ESN or blacklisted IMEI is naturally a headache, however, all hope isn’t lost.

It involves both technological and legal maneuvering. It’s important to note that unlocking a blacklisted phone might not make it fully operational, but it can help in using it with carriers outside the country where it was blacklisted.</p><h3 id="Understanding-Lock-Status"><a href="#Understanding-Lock-Status" class="headerlink" title="Understanding Lock Status"></a>Understanding Lock Status</h3><p>Before proceeding, ensure you understand the lock status of your phone. If the phone is network locked, it only works with a specific carrier. If it is blacklisted, it’s barred from most network use. An unlocked phone, on the other hand, is a blank slate ready to work with any carrier that supports the Apple iPhone 15 Plus device’s technological specifications.</p><h3 id="Steps-to-Unlock"><a href="#Steps-to-Unlock" class="headerlink" title="Steps to Unlock"></a>Steps to Unlock</h3><p>Here’s a comprehensive overview of the steps to unlock a phone with a bad ESN or blacklisted IMEI:</p><ol><li><strong><strong>Ascertain Legality:</strong></strong> Ensure unlocking your phone is within the bounds of the law, both locally and globally. Legal provisions such as the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) in the US and similar laws elsewhere define the circumstances under which phone unlocking is legal.</li><li><strong><strong>Contact the Carrier:</strong></strong> If the blacklisting issue has been resolved, contacting the carrier who blacklisted the Apple iPhone 15 Plus device is the most straightforward way to unlock it. They may require clear documentation proving ownership of the Apple iPhone 15 Plus device and the resolution of the reason for blacklisting.</li><li><strong><strong>Consider Third-Party Services:</strong></strong> If your phone was blacklisted from a carrier in a different country where unlocking might be a common practice, third-party services can assist. Verify that they are reputable and have a solid track record, as well as a range of positive reviews from previous customers.</li><li><strong><strong>IMEI Repair and Unlock Tools:</strong></strong> Some advanced users may consider IMEI repair software or unlock tools. However, utilizing these services could be illegal or fraudulent unless you are a certified technician who can verify the legitimacy of the software being used and the legality of the method in your region.</li><li><strong><strong>Seek Professional Repair Centers:</strong></strong> If all else fails, there are mobile repair shops that specialize in this type of work. It’s important to vet these services thoroughly, and ensure they are trained in such repairs and have a history of success.</li></ol><h3 id="Considerations-and-Warnings"><a href="#Considerations-and-Warnings" class="headerlink" title="Considerations and Warnings"></a>Considerations and Warnings</h3><ul><li><strong><strong>Device Warranty:</strong></strong> Unlocking a phone could void its warranty. Consider the cost-benefit of unlocking versus keeping the Apple iPhone 15 Plus device under warranty.</li><li><strong><strong>Legal Ramifications:</strong></strong> Unauthorized unlocking can have legal repercussions. It’s important to research and ensure compliance with all relevant laws.</li><li><strong><strong>Financial Risks:</strong></strong> Some services come at a high cost, and there are scams in the market. Be cautious and only deal with recognized and trusted entities.</li></ul><h2 id="Part-5-Frequently-Asked-Questions"><a href="#Part-5-Frequently-Asked-Questions" class="headerlink" title="Part 5: Frequently Asked Questions"></a>Part 5: Frequently Asked Questions</h2><h4 id="Q-Can-I-find-out-if-this-iPhone-is-reported-as-lost-or-stolen-I-mean-which-one-is-it"><a href="#Q-Can-I-find-out-if-this-iPhone-is-reported-as-lost-or-stolen-I-mean-which-one-is-it" class="headerlink" title="Q: Can I find out if this iPhone is reported as lost or stolen?

However, in cases where the user is the original owner and the phone is paid off, it’s typically legal to unlock the Apple iPhone 15 Plus device.</p><h4 id="Q-Can-You-Use-a-Blacklisted-Phone-Internationally"><a href="#Q-Can-You-Use-a-Blacklisted-Phone-Internationally" class="headerlink" title="Q: Can You Use a Blacklisted Phone Internationally?"></a><strong>Q: Can You Use a Blacklisted Phone Internationally?</strong></h4><p>In some cases, a blacklisted phone can be used internationally. When a phone is blacklisted, it’s typically barred from the carrier network where the blacklist was applied. However, different countries have different national blacklists, so it’s possible that a phone blacklisted in one country will work in another. Unlocking the phone internationally can be an option here.</p><h4 id="Q-Can-IMEI-Cleaning-Really-Work"><a href="#Q-Can-IMEI-Cleaning-Really-Work" class="headerlink" title="Q: Can IMEI Cleaning Really Work?"></a><strong>Q: Can IMEI Cleaning Really Work?</strong></h4><p>IMEI cleaning is the process by which the IMEI’s blacklisted status is removed. There are services that offer to clean your IMEI, and while some may work, it’s important to understand the legality and efficacy of such services, as it may involve fraudulent activity and your phone may still not be fully operational on some networks even after being cleaned.</p><h4 id="Q-What-Consequences-Can-I-Face-by-Using-a-Blacklisted-Phone"><a href="#Q-What-Consequences-Can-I-Face-by-Using-a-Blacklisted-Phone" class="headerlink" title="Q: What Consequences Can I Face by Using a Blacklisted Phone?"></a><strong>Q: What Consequences Can I Face by Using a Blacklisted Phone?</strong></h4><p>Using a blacklisted phone can have various consequences.

The complexity of resolving the issue hinges on various factors including the reasons for blacklisting, the phone model, and the networks involved, among others.

Get Your Xiaomi 13T Phone Network-Ready</h2><p>A network-locked device tethers you to one carrier, limiting your choices. You might miss out on better deals, struggle with roaming charges abroad, or feel inconvenienced by limited coverage. And you can’t avoid these things without the right <strong>SIM network unlock PIN</strong>.</p><p>That’s why we’ve created this comprehensive guide to help you unlock your phone’s potential. This article will explain what a <strong>SIM network unlock PIN</strong> is, the process involved, and answer any questions you might have. Keep scrolling to learn more.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/02/sim-network-unlock-pin-01.jpg"                      alt="enter sim network unlock pin"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-Why-Is-Your-Xiaomi-13T-Asking-for-a-SIM-Network-Unlock-PIN"><a href="#Part-1-Why-Is-Your-Xiaomi-13T-Asking-for-a-SIM-Network-Unlock-PIN" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Why Is Your Xiaomi 13T Asking for a SIM Network Unlock PIN?"></a>Part 1: Why Is Your Xiaomi 13T Asking for a SIM Network Unlock PIN?</h2><p>You just bought a new phone, excited to use it with a new SIM card. But your phone pops up with a request for a PIN code to unlock it. What’s that all about, and what do you enter? There are two main reasons why your phone might be asking for a SIM PIN or unlock code:</p><p>SIM Network Lock</p><p>The SIM Network Lock is a restriction placed by your phone’s original network provider, locking it to their network. It means you can only use the Xiaomi 13T device with SIM cards from that specific carrier. Carriers use this to ensure that the phones they sell work only with their service. When you buy a subsidized phone, they want to ensure you stick around for the contract duration.</p><p>If you insert a SIM card from a different carrier, your phone will ask for a <strong>SIM Network Unlock PIN</strong> or Network Unlock Code (NUC). You’ll learn more about it in the upcoming sections of this article.</p><p>SIM Card Lock</p><p>SIM Card Lock is a security feature that protects your SIM card from unauthorized use on other devices. It requires you to enter a PIN (Personal Identification Number) to unlock the SIM card before you can use it.</p><p>The default PIN is usually printed on the back of the SIM card or its packaging. If you haven’t changed your PIN, use the 4-8 digit code provided by the carrier when you get your SIM card.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/02/sim-network-unlock-pin-02.jpg"                      alt="sim card lock pin"                ></p><p>If you’ve forgotten the <strong>SIM PIN code</strong>, you can use the PUK (PIN Unlock Key) code to unlock the SIM and set a new PIN. The PUK code is also printed on the SIM card packaging, but be careful, as entering the wrong PUK code too many times can permanently lock the SIM card.</p><p>Not knowing the <strong>SIM unlock PIN</strong> code can be frustrating, especially if you want to switch mobile carriers. So, in the next part, we’ll explore whether it’s possible to unlock a SIM network-locked iPhone device.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Can-a-SIM-Network-Locked-iPhone-Be-Unlocked"><a href="#Part-2-Can-a-SIM-Network-Locked-iPhone-Be-Unlocked" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Can a SIM Network Locked iPhone Be Unlocked?"></a>Part 2: Can a SIM Network Locked iPhone Be Unlocked?</h2><p>Yes, a SIM network-locked iPhone can be unlocked by your network provider. Insert a new SIM card, and you’ll be prompted to enter the <strong>SIM Network Unlock PIN</strong>. After inputting the correct unlock code, your iPhone is ready to use with any carrier.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/02/sim-network-unlock-pin-03.jpg"                      alt="sim not valid message on iphone"                ></p><p>If you are thinking about unlocking your iPhone, it’s crucial to grasp what a <strong>SIM Network Unlock PIN</strong> is and how it functions.</p><h2 id="Part-3-What-Is-a-SIM-Network-Unlock-PIN"><a href="#Part-3-What-Is-a-SIM-Network-Unlock-PIN" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: What Is a SIM Network Unlock PIN?"></a>Part 3: What Is a SIM Network Unlock PIN?</h2><p>A <strong>SIM network unlock PIN</strong> is a code allowing you to remove your phone’s network lock. It means you can use your phone with a SIM card from any compatible network provider, not just the one you originally bought it from. It is also known as Network Unlock PIN (NUP), Network Control Key (NCK), or Network Unlock Code (NUC).</p><p>Unlocking your device can be useful if you:</p><ul><li>Bought a phone locked to a specific carrier and want to switch to a different one.</li><li>Are planning a trip abroad and want to use a local SIM card instead.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/02/sim-network-unlock-pin-04.jpg"                      alt="international travel illustration"                ></p><ul><li>Still haven’t finished your contract with your original carrier and want to keep the phone but use a different service.</li><li>Bought a phone second-hand locked to the previous owner’s network.</li><li>Want to increase your phone’s resale value; unlocked phones generally have a higher resale value than locked phones, as various buyers can use them.</li><li>Want more carrier flexibility; you are not tied to one carrier and can choose the provider that best suits your needs in terms of price, coverage, data plans, and other features.</li></ul><p>Things To Consider</p><p>Before you proceed, here are some key points to remember:</p><ul><li>Eligibility: Not all phones are eligible for network unlocking. Check with your carrier or manufacturer for details.</li><li>Costs: While some carriers can give <strong>SIM network unlock PIN for free</strong>, others may charge a fee.

This 4-digit code protects your phone number from unauthorized calls, texts, and data use. It’s essential to change the default PIN to one that’s both memorable for you and difficult for others to guess.</p><p>So, <strong>how to change the PIN on an Android phone</strong>’s SIM card?

Unlike the PIN you use to unlock your phone, the SIM PIN code is a separate layer of security. If someone tries to use your SIM card in another phone without the correct PIN, they won’t be able to access your network or data.</p><p>Here are more reasons why <strong>changing the PIN code of a SIM card</strong> is a smart move:</p><ul><li>Default PINs are easy to guess</li></ul><p>Most carriers use generic PINs like “1234” or “0000”. Change it to something unique and harder to crack.</p><ul><li>Protects data in case of loss or theft</li></ul><p>If you lose your phone or it gets stolen, a strong PIN code hinders the thief’s ability to make calls, send messages, or access your data stored on the SIM. It buys you time to report the loss and block your SIM card before they can do any damage.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/02/how-to-change-pin-on-android-phone-02.jpg"                      alt="sim card locked"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1938677/19272" target="_top" id="1938677">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1938677" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1938677/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><ul><li>Prevents accidental PIN lockouts</li></ul><p>Using a memorable PIN minimizes the risk of accidentally locking yourself out of your SIM card.</p><ul><li>Peace of mind</li></ul><p>It is crucial if you store sensitive info on your SIM or use your phone for work.

Thankfully, Android allows you to easily change your SIM card PIN to a more personal and memorable code. But before you begin:</p><ul><li>Contact your network carrier to get your PUK code if you already have it. You’ll need this if you enter the wrong PIN three times and lock your SIM card.</li><li>Remember the temporary default PIN: Most SIM cards have a default PIN, often 1234 or 0123. If you haven’t changed it, this is the PIN you’ll use initially.</li></ul><p><strong>Note:</strong></p><p>Entering the wrong PIN three times will lock your SIM card. You’ll need your network carrier’s PUK code to unlock it. Use it cautiously, as exceeding the maximum number of attempts will permanently block your SIM card. So, it’s best to memorize your PIN or store it securely to avoid relying on the PUK altogether.</p><p>Steps To Change Your SIM PIN</p><p>Here’s <strong>how to find and manage the SIM PIN code on Android</strong>:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Navigate to your phone’s <strong>Settings</strong> app. Next, look for the <strong>Security and privacy</strong> or <strong>Lock screen and security</strong> (or other similar option) depending on your device’s model.</li><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Scroll down and tap on <strong>More security settings</strong> or <strong>Other security settings</strong>.</li><li><strong>Step 3:</strong> Tap <strong>SIM card security</strong> or <strong>Set up SIM card lock</strong> (or something similar).</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/02/how-to-change-pin-on-android-phone-03.jpg"                      alt="sim card security in settings"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Step 4:</strong> If you have multiple SIMs, select the one you want to change the PIN code.</li><li><strong>Step 5:</strong> Tap <strong>Change SIM PIN</strong>.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/02/how-to-change-pin-on-android-phone-04.jpg"                      alt="change sim pin code on android"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Step 6:</strong> Input your current SIM card PIN code and tap <strong>OK</strong>.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/02/how-to-change-pin-on-android-phone-05.jpg"                      alt="enter old sim pin"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Step 7:</strong> Enter your desired new PIN code and tap <strong>OK</strong>.</li><li><strong>Step 8:</strong> Re-enter your new SIM card PIN code and tap <strong>OK</strong> to confirm.</li></ul><p>Success!

Benefits of Using Android SIM Unlock Code Generator"></a>Part 3. Benefits of Using Android SIM Unlock Code Generator</h2><p>There are several benefits of using Android SIM unlock code generator. Some of these benefits are:</p><ul><li><strong>1. Freedom to choose your carrier</strong></li></ul><p>When your phone is carrier locked, you are limited to using only the carrier that the phone is locked to. This can be a problem if you travel frequently or want to switch to a different carrier. By unlocking your phone’s SIM card, you will be able to use any carrier’s SIM card, giving you the freedom to choose the carrier that best suits your needs.</p><ul><li><strong>2. Cost savings</strong></li></ul><p>By unlocking your phone’s SIM card, you can save money on roaming charges when traveling. Instead of paying expensive roaming charges, you can simply purchase a local SIM card and use it in your unlocked phone. This can save you a lot of money in the long run.</p><ul><li><strong>3. Resale value</strong></li></ul><p>An unlocked phone has a higher resale value than a carrier-locked phone. This is because an unlocked phone can be used with any carrier’s SIM card, making it more attractive to buyers.</p><ul><li><strong>4. No need to buy a new phone</strong></li></ul><p>If you want to switch to a different carrier, you may be tempted to buy a new phone that is compatible with that carrier. However, by unlocking your phone’s SIM card, you can use your existing phone with any carrier’s SIM card, saving you the cost of buying a new phone.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1983471">                    <video width="576" height="240" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1983471.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/22993-1983471">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1983471.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:360px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Fhomestyler.sjv.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1983471%2F22993'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1983471/22993"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-4-4-Android-SIM-Unlock-Code-Generators-Reviews"><a href="#Part-4-4-Android-SIM-Unlock-Code-Generators-Reviews" class="headerlink" title="Part 4. 4 Android SIM Unlock Code Generators Reviews"></a>Part 4. 4 Android SIM Unlock Code Generators Reviews</h2><p>There are several Android SIM unlock code generator software available on the internet.

When you purchase your device, the seller will jot down the original IMEI number on your receipt. So if you changed your IMEI and lost it, you may not be able to claim it. This is because authorities cannot see if it is truly yours. After all, the IMEI numbers no longer correlate with each other.</li></ol><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Find-the-IMEI-on-an-Android-5-Ways"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Find-the-IMEI-on-an-Android-5-Ways" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Find the IMEI on an Android?

But your phone pops up with a request for a PIN code to unlock it. What’s that all about, and what do you enter? There are two main reasons why your phone might be asking for a SIM PIN or unlock code:</p><p>SIM Network Lock</p><p>The SIM Network Lock is a restriction placed by your phone’s original network provider, locking it to their network. It means you can only use the Tecno Spark 20 Pro+ device with SIM cards from that specific carrier. Carriers use this to ensure that the phones they sell work only with their service. When you buy a subsidized phone, they want to ensure you stick around for the contract duration.</p><p>If you insert a SIM card from a different carrier, your phone will ask for a <strong>SIM Network Unlock PIN</strong> or Network Unlock Code (NUC). You’ll learn more about it in the upcoming sections of this article.</p><p>SIM Card Lock</p><p>SIM Card Lock is a security feature that protects your SIM card from unauthorized use on other devices. It requires you to enter a PIN (Personal Identification Number) to unlock the SIM card before you can use it.</p><p>The default PIN is usually printed on the back of the SIM card or its packaging. If you haven’t changed your PIN, use the 4-8 digit code provided by the carrier when you get your SIM card.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/02/sim-network-unlock-pin-02.jpg"                      alt="sim card lock pin"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/c/5597632/2134492/18498" target="_top" id="2134492">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18498-2134492" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/i/5597632/2134492/18498"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>If you’ve forgotten the <strong>SIM PIN code</strong>, you can use the PUK (PIN Unlock Key) code to unlock the SIM and set a new PIN. The PUK code is also printed on the SIM card packaging, but be careful, as entering the wrong PUK code too many times can permanently lock the SIM card.</p><p>Not knowing the <strong>SIM unlock PIN</strong> code can be frustrating, especially if you want to switch mobile carriers. So, in the next part, we’ll explore whether it’s possible to unlock a SIM network-locked iPhone device.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Can-a-SIM-Network-Locked-iPhone-Be-Unlocked"><a href="#Part-2-Can-a-SIM-Network-Locked-iPhone-Be-Unlocked" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Can a SIM Network Locked iPhone Be Unlocked?"></a>Part 2: Can a SIM Network Locked iPhone Be Unlocked?</h2><p>Yes, a SIM network-locked iPhone can be unlocked by your network provider.

Check with your carrier or manufacturer for details.</li><li>Costs: While some carriers can give <strong>SIM network unlock PIN for free</strong>, others may charge a fee. Third-party unlocking services also typically charge a fee.</li><li>Waiting time: It can take days or even weeks to receive your <strong>SIM unlock PIN</strong>code from your carrier and process it. For instance, Vodafone usually unlocks the Tecno Spark 20 Pro+ device within 72 hours to 10 days if they have to reach the manufacturer.</li><li>Risks: Using an unauthorized unlocking method could damage your phone or void its warranty.</li><li>Backup: Before unlocking your phone, back up your data, as the process may erase it.</li></ul><p>Now that you understand <strong>SIM Network Unlock PIN</strong>, let’s get down to business!

Your SIM locks itself after three to five wrong inputs, on average. Although it might be annoying, doing these guards against unauthorized access to your phone and personal data. If your cell phone is lost or stolen, PUK blocked will prevent prospective hackers from making calls.</p><p>Your mobile phone display can say “PIN blocked” or “Enter PUK code.” PUK stands for PIN Unblocking Key in the PUK code. The PUK code is seldom given to you when you receive your membership in the US. Contact Your Xiaomi Redmi 12 5G provider’s customer support if you don’t know your PUK code.</p><h2 id="Part-1-Why-Was-My-Sim-Card-Blocked"><a href="#Part-1-Why-Was-My-Sim-Card-Blocked" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Why Was My Sim Card Blocked?"></a>Part 1: Why Was My Sim Card Blocked?</h2><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2012406/19272" target="_top" id="2012406">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2012406" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2012406/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="1-3-times-incorrect-Pin-entered"><a href="#1-3-times-incorrect-Pin-entered" class="headerlink" title="1. 3 times incorrect Pin entered"></a>1. 3 times incorrect Pin entered</h3><p>Sometimes when you forget your pin and keep on entering the wrong one, you can get PUK Blocked.

Please log in to the appropriate website or app, then go to your profile to see whether anything about “PUK” is available there.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/10/how-to-unlock-puk-blocked-sim-card-5.jpg"                      alt="go to career website and check your sim card puk"                ></p><p>It shouldn’t be an issue if you were utilizing or signed in to the platform before your SIM was disabled. However, if not, you might not be able to access anything since you could be asked to input an OTP to verify your identity.</p><p>Please remove the SIM card and try again if you can’t access your phone to utilize the app or website because of the SIM lock. After receiving the PUK code, you can re-insert the SIM and input it.</p><h3 id="3-Contact-your-carrier"><a href="#3-Contact-your-carrier" class="headerlink" title="3. Contact your carrier"></a>3. Contact your carrier</h3><p>It’s time to call customer support, which should be simpler for most individuals if none of the above options work for you. For example, your mobile service provider created your SIM card. Therefore, they have all the information you would require. Before they divulge anything to you, though, they should be able to verify your identity.</p><p>Use a different phone to call your customer service number and describe the issue. And following a series of inquiries, they should offer your PUK number as identification.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/10/how-to-unlock-puk-blocked-sim-card-6.jpg"                      alt="solve the sim card not accessed issue"                ></p><p>However, customer service won’t release the code if you can’t back yourself up.

This 4-digit code protects your phone number from unauthorized calls, texts, and data use. It’s essential to change the default PIN to one that’s both memorable for you and difficult for others to guess.</p><p>So, <strong>how to change the PIN on an Android phone</strong>’s SIM card? This article will provide a step-by-step guide to help you secure your data. But first, let’s explore why changing the default one is important.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/02/how-to-change-pin-on-android-phone-01.jpg"                      alt="a phone sim card"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-Why-Does-Changing-Your-SIM-PIN-Code-Matter-on-a-New-Phone"><a href="#Part-1-Why-Does-Changing-Your-SIM-PIN-Code-Matter-on-a-New-Phone" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Why Does Changing Your SIM PIN Code Matter on a New Phone?"></a>Part 1: Why Does Changing Your SIM PIN Code Matter on a New Phone?</h2><p>Your SIM PIN code acts as a password for your SIM card, which stores your phone number, contacts, and other essential data. Unlike the PIN you use to unlock your phone, the SIM PIN code is a separate layer of security. If someone tries to use your SIM card in another phone without the correct PIN, they won’t be able to access your network or data.</p><p>Here are more reasons why <strong>changing the PIN code of a SIM card</strong> is a smart move:</p><ul><li>Default PINs are easy to guess</li></ul><p>Most carriers use generic PINs like “1234” or “0000”. Change it to something unique and harder to crack.</p><ul><li>Protects data in case of loss or theft</li></ul><p>If you lose your phone or it gets stolen, a strong PIN code hinders the thief’s ability to make calls, send messages, or access your data stored on the SIM. It buys you time to report the loss and block your SIM card before they can do any damage.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/02/how-to-change-pin-on-android-phone-02.jpg"                      alt="sim card locked"                ></p><ul><li>Prevents accidental PIN lockouts</li></ul><p>Using a memorable PIN minimizes the risk of accidentally locking yourself out of your SIM card.</p><ul><li>Peace of mind</li></ul><p>It is crucial if you store sensitive info on your SIM or use your phone for work. Knowing about this extra safeguard is reassuring, ensuring your data stays protected.</p><p><strong>Remember:</strong></p><p>Choose a PIN code for your SIM that’s easy for you to remember but challenging for others to guess. Avoid using birthdays, anniversaries, or other easily identifiable information. By taking a few minutes to <strong>change the PIN code of the SIM card</strong>, you’ll gain a significant security advantage for your new phone and data.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-To-Change-Pin-on-Android-Phone-SIM-Cards"><a href="#Part-2-How-To-Change-Pin-on-Android-Phone-SIM-Cards" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How To Change Pin on Android Phone SIM Cards?"></a>Part 2: How To Change Pin on Android Phone SIM Cards?</h2><p>Keeping your SIM card secure is crucial for protecting your data and privacy. Thankfully, Android allows you to easily change your SIM card PIN to a more personal and memorable code. But before you begin:</p><ul><li>Contact your network carrier to get your PUK code if you already have it. You’ll need this if you enter the wrong PIN three times and lock your SIM card.</li><li>Remember the temporary default PIN: Most SIM cards have a default PIN, often 1234 or 0123. If you haven’t changed it, this is the PIN you’ll use initially.</li></ul><p><strong>Note:</strong></p><p>Entering the wrong PIN three times will lock your SIM card. You’ll need your network carrier’s PUK code to unlock it. Use it cautiously, as exceeding the maximum number of attempts will permanently block your SIM card. So, it’s best to memorize your PIN or store it securely to avoid relying on the PUK altogether.</p><p>Steps To Change Your SIM PIN</p><p>Here’s <strong>how to find and manage the SIM PIN code on Android</strong>:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Navigate to your phone’s <strong>Settings</strong> app. Next, look for the <strong>Security and privacy</strong> or <strong>Lock screen and security</strong> (or other similar option) depending on your device’s model.</li><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Scroll down and tap on <strong>More security settings</strong> or <strong>Other security settings</strong>.</li><li><strong>Step 3:</strong> Tap <strong>SIM card security</strong> or <strong>Set up SIM card lock</strong> (or something similar).</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/02/how-to-change-pin-on-android-phone-03.jpg"                      alt="sim card security in settings"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Step 4:</strong> If you have multiple SIMs, select the one you want to change the PIN code.</li><li><strong>Step 5:</strong> Tap <strong>Change SIM PIN</strong>.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/02/how-to-change-pin-on-android-phone-04.jpg"                      alt="change sim pin code on android"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Step 6:</strong> Input your current SIM card PIN code and tap <strong>OK</strong>.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/02/how-to-change-pin-on-android-phone-05.jpg"                      alt="enter old sim pin"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1880960/19272" target="_top" id="1880960">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1880960" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1880960/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><ul><li><strong>Step 7:</strong> Enter your desired new PIN code and tap <strong>OK</strong>.</li><li><strong>Step 8:</strong> Re-enter your new SIM card PIN code and tap <strong>OK</strong> to confirm.</li></ul><p>Success!

And you can’t avoid these things without the right <strong>SIM network unlock PIN</strong>.</p><p>That’s why we’ve created this comprehensive guide to help you unlock your phone’s potential.

But your phone pops up with a request for a PIN code to unlock it. What’s that all about, and what do you enter? There are two main reasons why your phone might be asking for a SIM PIN or unlock code:</p><p>SIM Network Lock</p><p>The SIM Network Lock is a restriction placed by your phone’s original network provider, locking it to their network. It means you can only use the Xiaomi Redmi K70E device with SIM cards from that specific carrier. Carriers use this to ensure that the phones they sell work only with their service. When you buy a subsidized phone, they want to ensure you stick around for the contract duration.</p><p>If you insert a SIM card from a different carrier, your phone will ask for a <strong>SIM Network Unlock PIN</strong> or Network Unlock Code (NUC). You’ll learn more about it in the upcoming sections of this article.</p><p>SIM Card Lock</p><p>SIM Card Lock is a security feature that protects your SIM card from unauthorized use on other devices. It requires you to enter a PIN (Personal Identification Number) to unlock the SIM card before you can use it.</p><p>The default PIN is usually printed on the back of the SIM card or its packaging. If you haven’t changed your PIN, use the 4-8 digit code provided by the carrier when you get your SIM card.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/02/sim-network-unlock-pin-02.jpg"                      alt="sim card lock pin"                ></p><p>If you’ve forgotten the <strong>SIM PIN code</strong>, you can use the PUK (PIN Unlock Key) code to unlock the SIM and set a new PIN. The PUK code is also printed on the SIM card packaging, but be careful, as entering the wrong PUK code too many times can permanently lock the SIM card.</p><p>Not knowing the <strong>SIM unlock PIN</strong> code can be frustrating, especially if you want to switch mobile carriers. So, in the next part, we’ll explore whether it’s possible to unlock a SIM network-locked iPhone device.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Can-a-SIM-Network-Locked-iPhone-Be-Unlocked"><a href="#Part-2-Can-a-SIM-Network-Locked-iPhone-Be-Unlocked" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Can a SIM Network Locked iPhone Be Unlocked?"></a>Part 2: Can a SIM Network Locked iPhone Be Unlocked?</h2><p>Yes, a SIM network-locked iPhone can be unlocked by your network provider. Insert a new SIM card, and you’ll be prompted to enter the <strong>SIM Network Unlock PIN</strong>.

Check with your carrier or manufacturer for details.</li><li>Costs: While some carriers can give <strong>SIM network unlock PIN for free</strong>, others may charge a fee. Third-party unlocking services also typically charge a fee.</li><li>Waiting time: It can take days or even weeks to receive your <strong>SIM unlock PIN</strong>code from your carrier and process it. For instance, Vodafone usually unlocks the Xiaomi Redmi K70E device within 72 hours to 10 days if they have to reach the manufacturer.</li><li>Risks: Using an unauthorized unlocking method could damage your phone or void its warranty.</li><li>Backup: Before unlocking your phone, back up your data, as the process may erase it.</li></ul><p>Now that you understand <strong>SIM Network Unlock PIN</strong>, let’s get down to business!

Understanding how to tackle this issue can save time, money, and a headache or two. In this extensive guide, we’ll walk you through the basic mechanics of ESN and IMEI, how to check if your Apple iPhone 15 Plus is blacklisted, and the detailed steps for unlocking a phone with a bad ESN or blacklisted IMEI.</p><h2 id="Part-1-Basic-information-about-IMEI-number-and-ESN"><a href="#Part-1-Basic-information-about-IMEI-number-and-ESN" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Basic information about IMEI number and ESN"></a>Part 1: Basic information about IMEI number and ESN</h2><h3 id="What-is-IMEI-number"><a href="#What-is-IMEI-number" class="headerlink" title="What is IMEI number?"></a>What is IMEI number?</h3><p>IMEI (International Mobile Equipment Identity): IMEI numbers are unique to GSM (Global System for Mobile Communications) and UMTS (Universal Mobile Telecommunications System) network mobile phones. Unlike ESN, an IMEI number is 15 digits long. It serves as an anti-theft measure, meaning a blacklisted IMEI can result from a device being reported lost or stolen or a breach of the consumer agreement.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/iphone-imei-check.jpg"                      alt="iPhone imei number check"                ></p><h3 id="What-is-an-ESN"><a href="#What-is-an-ESN" class="headerlink" title="What is an ESN?"></a>What is an ESN?</h3><p>Electronic Serial Number (ESN): Previously utilized by CDMA (Code Division Multiple Access) networks, an ESN was a unique identifier for cellular devices. With technological progression, most carriers have shifted their focus to the IMEI system, but knowing your ESN’s history is still crucial, especially if you’re dealing with older devices.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://malaysia-healthcare-travel-council.pxf.io/c/5597632/1557742/17382" target="_top" id="1557742">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17382-1557742" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://malaysia-healthcare-travel-council.pxf.io/i/5597632/1557742/17382"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="What-is-a-Bad-ESN"><a href="#What-is-a-Bad-ESN" class="headerlink" title="What is a Bad ESN?"></a>What is a Bad ESN?</h3><p>A Bad ESN can mean a lot of things, let’s check out some examples:</p><ol><li>If you hear this term most probably you are trying to activate the Apple iPhone 15 Plus device with a carrier, but that’s not possible due to some reasons.</li><li>It can mean that the previous owner of the Apple iPhone 15 Plus device switched carriers.</li><li>The previous owner had an outstanding amount on their bill and cancelled the account without paying the bill first.</li><li>The previous owner didn’t have a bill when they cancelled the account but they were still under a contract and if you cancel sooner than the due date for the contract, an “early termination fee” is created based on the remaining period of the contract and they hadn’t paid that amount.</li><li>The person that sold you the phone or someone else who was the actual owner of the Apple iPhone 15 Plus device reported the Apple iPhone 15 Plus device as lost or stolen.</li></ol><h3 id="What-is-a-blacklisted-IMEI"><a href="#What-is-a-blacklisted-IMEI" class="headerlink" title="What is a blacklisted IMEI?"></a>What is a blacklisted IMEI?</h3><p>Blacklisted IMEI is basically the same thing as Bad ESN but for devices that work on CDMA networks, like Verizon or Sprint. In short, the main reason that a device has a Blacklisted IMEI is so that you as the owner or someone else cannot activate the Apple iPhone 15 Plus device on any carrier, not even the original one, thus avoiding selling or stealing the phone.</p><p><strong>You Might Be Interested In:</strong></p><ol><li><a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/backup-iphone/backup-iphone-to-itunes.html" >Ultimate Guide to Backing Up iPhone With&#x2F;Without iTunes <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li><li><a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/unlock/unlock-disabled-iphone-without-itunes.html" >3 Ways to Unlock A Disabled iPhone Without iTunes <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li><li><a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/unlock/unlock-iphone-passcode.html" >How to Unlock iPhone Passcode With or Without iTunes? <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li></ol><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1424529">                    <video width="864" height="1536" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1424529.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16446-1424529">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1424529.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:540px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Flaganoo.pxf.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1424529%2F16446'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1424529/16446"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-check-if-your-Apple-iPhone-15-Plus-is-blacklisted"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-check-if-your-Apple-iPhone-15-Plus-is-blacklisted" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to check if your Apple iPhone 15 Plus is blacklisted?"></a>Part 2: How to check if your Apple iPhone 15 Plus is blacklisted?</h2><p>In order to check if an iPhone is blacklisted, you need to first <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/unlock/imei-check-iphone.html" >retrieve your IMEI <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> or ESN number to check if it’s blacklisted.</p><h3 id="How-to-find-the-IMEI-or-ESN-numbers"><a href="#How-to-find-the-IMEI-or-ESN-numbers" class="headerlink" title="How to find the IMEI or ESN numbers"></a>How to find the IMEI or ESN numbers</h3><ol><li>On the original box of the iPhone, usually around the barcode.</li><li>In Settings, if you go to General &gt; About, you can find the IMEI or ESN.</li><li>On some iPhones, it’s in the SIM card tray when you pull it out.</li><li>Some iPhones have it engraved on the back of the case.</li><li>If you dial *#06# on your dial pad you will get the IMEI or ESN.</li></ol><h3 id="How-to-verify-if-your-Apple-iPhone-15-Plus-is-blacklisted"><a href="#How-to-verify-if-your-Apple-iPhone-15-Plus-is-blacklisted" class="headerlink" title="How to verify if your Apple iPhone 15 Plus is blacklisted?"></a>How to verify if your Apple iPhone 15 Plus is blacklisted?</h3><p>Checking if your Apple iPhone 15 Plus has a blacklisted IMEI is the first step in addressing the issue. There are several methods to do this, either via the Apple website, the network carrier, or through third-party IMEI check services.</p><ol><li><strong>Apple’s Blacklist Status Tool:</strong> Operating directly from Apple’s official website, entering your IMEI number can provide instant clarity on its status.</li><li><strong>Network Carrier Services:</strong> Another way is to contact the carrier that the Apple iPhone 15 Plus was initially sold from. Finding out is easy, just look for a logo: on the box of the iPhone, on the back case of it and even on the screen of the Apple iPhone 15 Plus as it boots up. Just look for any carrier, Verizon, Sprint, T-Mobile, etc. Contacting your network carrier can also yield a blacklist status. Bear in mind that not all network services are equally adept or willing to communicate this information, and turnaround times may vary.</li><li><strong>Third-Party IMEI Check Services:</strong> Utilizing third-party IMEI checkers is often the quickest method. These can be found as online services or apps, but it’s important to choose reputable sources. This is a highly recommended source to <a class="link"   href="https://www.doctorsim.com/libtrkafl.html?pc=43d47c30d945bcbd7d9527f4049f649a&refe=https://www.doctorsim.com/us-en/?scp&euro" >check the status of your phone <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> because it’s quick, reliable and offers no fuss.

It can result in a device being unusable on most of the surrounding networks. If your IMEI is blacklisted, there are steps for potential resolution:</p><h3 id="Ask-the-seller-for-a-refund"><a href="#Ask-the-seller-for-a-refund" class="headerlink" title="Ask the seller for a refund"></a>Ask the seller for a refund</h3><p>If you bought the Apple iPhone 15 Plus device with the bad ESN newly from a retailer or online shop, you might be in luck as they can provide you with a refund or at least a replacement, depending on their policy. For example, Amazon and eBay have refund policies. Unfortunately, if you got the phone from someone you found on the street, or from a seller over sources like Craigslist, this might not be possible. But there are still other things you can do.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/10-things-you-can-do-with-an-iphone-that-has-bad-esn-or-blacklisted-iemi-5.png"                      alt="iPhone blacklisted imei"                ></p><h3 id="Use-it-as-a-gaming-console-or-iPod"><a href="#Use-it-as-a-gaming-console-or-iPod" class="headerlink" title="Use it as a gaming console or iPod"></a>Use it as a gaming console or iPod</h3><p>Smartphones have a whole lot of functionality besides being able to place calls.

Legal provisions such as the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) in the US and similar laws elsewhere define the circumstances under which phone unlocking is legal.</li><li><strong><strong>Contact the Carrier:</strong></strong> If the blacklisting issue has been resolved, contacting the carrier who blacklisted the Apple iPhone 15 Plus device is the most straightforward way to unlock it. They may require clear documentation proving ownership of the Apple iPhone 15 Plus device and the resolution of the reason for blacklisting.</li><li><strong><strong>Consider Third-Party Services:</strong></strong> If your phone was blacklisted from a carrier in a different country where unlocking might be a common practice, third-party services can assist. Verify that they are reputable and have a solid track record, as well as a range of positive reviews from previous customers.</li><li><strong><strong>IMEI Repair and Unlock Tools:</strong></strong> Some advanced users may consider IMEI repair software or unlock tools. However, utilizing these services could be illegal or fraudulent unless you are a certified technician who can verify the legitimacy of the software being used and the legality of the method in your region.</li><li><strong><strong>Seek Professional Repair Centers:</strong></strong> If all else fails, there are mobile repair shops that specialize in this type of work. It’s important to vet these services thoroughly, and ensure they are trained in such repairs and have a history of success.</li></ol><h3 id="Considerations-and-Warnings"><a href="#Considerations-and-Warnings" class="headerlink" title="Considerations and Warnings"></a>Considerations and Warnings</h3><ul><li><strong><strong>Device Warranty:</strong></strong> Unlocking a phone could void its warranty.

So, it’s clear that you aren’t free to use your Apple iPhone 14. The most common barrier is that you can’t use a SIM card from another network. The good news is that you can set up your Apple iPhone 14 to connect to any network you want in several ways.</p><p>In this article, we’ll talk about the Apple iPhone 14 unlock chip and special software that can remove SIM restrictions from your Apple iPhone 14. After reading this article, I hope your Apple iPhone 14’s network settings will continue you from doing what you want.</p><h2 id="What-is-iPhone-Unlock-Chip"><a href="#What-is-iPhone-Unlock-Chip" class="headerlink" title="What is iPhone Unlock Chip?"></a>What is iPhone Unlock Chip?</h2><p>iPhone unlock chip is a microchip that unlocks the iPhones and makes them able to run on any network worldwide. When you buy an iPhone, it is either locked (unable to accept carrier) or factory unlocked (can accept any carrier). These unlock chips can bypass the carrier locks in iPhones and enable locked devices to work with any SIM.</p><p>An unlock chip is an easy and cheap way to get an Apple iPhone 14 to work with a different SIM card Using iPhone unlock chip enables the locked Apple iPhone 14 to call and send SMS using the local network sim card, just like a factory-unlocked phone does. There have been different unlocking chips available with different names and brands, but they all do the same thing.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/12/iphone-unlock-chip-1.jpg"                      alt="unlock chip"                ></p><h3 id="How-does-it-work"><a href="#How-does-it-work" class="headerlink" title="How does it work"></a>How does it work</h3><p>An unlock chip is typically a slim SIM card, a memory interface chip that can be put in along with your regular SIM card. It goes on top of your Apple iPhone 14’s normal SIM card and removes the network lock so you can use any sim.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/12/iphone-unlock-chip-4.jpg"                      alt="iphone unlock chip"                ></p><p>The factory lock is removed quickly when an unlock chip is put into your Apple iPhone 14. An iPhone Unlock Chip fools your Apple iPhone 14 into thinking it only uses a Cricket SIM card. The Apple iPhone 14 Unlock Chip has the structure to fake the iPhone’s IMEI number and the authentication key, which allows it to work with any GSM Service.</p><p>Putting an iPhone Unlock Chip around your regular SIM card changes how your Apple iPhone 14 and SIM card talk to each other. So, the unlock chip’s controller fakes the IMSI number, which allows you to use other mobile networks.</p><p>Unfortunately, many iPhone unlock chips require a jailbroken iPhone before being used. Even if your Apple iPhone 14 isn’t jailbroken, you can still use an iPhone unlock chip to access some of its features.</p><p>There are several places to find information about jailbreaking an iPhone. After selecting, you can program your Apple iPhone 14’s unlock chip by following the on-screen instructions.</p><h3 id="Pros-and-Cons-of-iPhone-Unlock-Chip"><a href="#Pros-and-Cons-of-iPhone-Unlock-Chip" class="headerlink" title="Pros and Cons of iPhone Unlock Chip"></a>Pros and Cons of iPhone Unlock Chip</h3><p>If you use an unofficial method for any task, it gets the benefit for a short time, but some losses are also associated with it.</p><p><strong>Pros:</strong></p><ul><li>Unlock chip SIM card doesn’t cost much.</li><li>It’s a simple way to get into your Apple iPhone 14.</li><li>It works with almost every kind of iPhone.</li><li>It works with many carriers in many different countries.</li></ul><p><strong>Cons:</strong></p><ul><li>It can unlock iPhones and iPads only.

It serves as an anti-theft measure, meaning a blacklisted IMEI can result from a device being reported lost or stolen or a breach of the consumer agreement.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/iphone-imei-check.jpg"                      alt="iPhone imei number check"                ></p><h3 id="What-is-an-ESN"><a href="#What-is-an-ESN" class="headerlink" title="What is an ESN?"></a>What is an ESN?</h3><p>Electronic Serial Number (ESN): Previously utilized by CDMA (Code Division Multiple Access) networks, an ESN was a unique identifier for cellular devices. With technological progression, most carriers have shifted their focus to the IMEI system, but knowing your ESN’s history is still crucial, especially if you’re dealing with older devices.</p><h3 id="What-is-a-Bad-ESN"><a href="#What-is-a-Bad-ESN" class="headerlink" title="What is a Bad ESN?"></a>What is a Bad ESN?</h3><p>A Bad ESN can mean a lot of things, let’s check out some examples:</p><ol><li>If you hear this term most probably you are trying to activate the Apple iPhone 14 device with a carrier, but that’s not possible due to some reasons.</li><li>It can mean that the previous owner of the Apple iPhone 14 device switched carriers.</li><li>The previous owner had an outstanding amount on their bill and cancelled the account without paying the bill first.</li><li>The previous owner didn’t have a bill when they cancelled the account but they were still under a contract and if you cancel sooner than the due date for the contract, an “early termination fee” is created based on the remaining period of the contract and they hadn’t paid that amount.</li><li>The person that sold you the phone or someone else who was the actual owner of the Apple iPhone 14 device reported the Apple iPhone 14 device as lost or stolen.</li></ol><h3 id="What-is-a-blacklisted-IMEI"><a href="#What-is-a-blacklisted-IMEI" class="headerlink" title="What is a blacklisted IMEI?"></a>What is a blacklisted IMEI?</h3><p>Blacklisted IMEI is basically the same thing as Bad ESN but for devices that work on CDMA networks, like Verizon or Sprint. In short, the main reason that a device has a Blacklisted IMEI is so that you as the owner or someone else cannot activate the Apple iPhone 14 device on any carrier, not even the original one, thus avoiding selling or stealing the phone.</p><p><strong>You Might Be Interested In:</strong></p><ol><li><a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/backup-iphone/backup-iphone-to-itunes.html" >Ultimate Guide to Backing Up iPhone With&#x2F;Without iTunes <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li><li><a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/unlock/unlock-disabled-iphone-without-itunes.html" >3 Ways to Unlock A Disabled iPhone Without iTunes <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li><li><a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/unlock/unlock-iphone-passcode.html" >How to Unlock iPhone Passcode With or Without iTunes? <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li></ol><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-check-if-your-Apple-iPhone-14-is-blacklisted"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-check-if-your-Apple-iPhone-14-is-blacklisted" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to check if your Apple iPhone 14 is blacklisted?"></a>Part 2: How to check if your Apple iPhone 14 is blacklisted?</h2><p>In order to check if an iPhone is blacklisted, you need to first <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/unlock/imei-check-iphone.html" >retrieve your IMEI <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> or ESN number to check if it’s blacklisted.</p><h3 id="How-to-find-the-IMEI-or-ESN-numbers"><a href="#How-to-find-the-IMEI-or-ESN-numbers" class="headerlink" title="How to find the IMEI or ESN numbers"></a>How to find the IMEI or ESN numbers</h3><ol><li>On the original box of the iPhone, usually around the barcode.</li><li>In Settings, if you go to General &gt; About, you can find the IMEI or ESN.</li><li>On some iPhones, it’s in the SIM card tray when you pull it out.</li><li>Some iPhones have it engraved on the back of the case.</li><li>If you dial *#06# on your dial pad you will get the IMEI or ESN.</li></ol><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://wigfever.sjv.io/c/5597632/2005183/22899" target="_top" id="2005183">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/22899-2005183" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://wigfever.sjv.io/i/5597632/2005183/22899"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="How-to-verify-if-your-Apple-iPhone-14-is-blacklisted"><a href="#How-to-verify-if-your-Apple-iPhone-14-is-blacklisted" class="headerlink" title="How to verify if your Apple iPhone 14 is blacklisted?"></a>How to verify if your Apple iPhone 14 is blacklisted?</h3><p>Checking if your Apple iPhone 14 has a blacklisted IMEI is the first step in addressing the issue.

For example, Amazon and eBay have refund policies. Unfortunately, if you got the phone from someone you found on the street, or from a seller over sources like Craigslist, this might not be possible. But there are still other things you can do.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/10-things-you-can-do-with-an-iphone-that-has-bad-esn-or-blacklisted-iemi-5.png"                      alt="iPhone blacklisted imei"                ></p><h3 id="Use-it-as-a-gaming-console-or-iPod"><a href="#Use-it-as-a-gaming-console-or-iPod" class="headerlink" title="Use it as a gaming console or iPod"></a>Use it as a gaming console or iPod</h3><p>Smartphones have a whole lot of functionality besides being able to place calls.

That’s because they won’t be on US soil long, and the IMEI is only blacklisted locally. So foreigners and tourists might be persuaded to buy your Apple iPhone 14 if you throw in a big enough discount.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/10-things-you-can-do-with-an-iphone-that-has-bad-esn-or-blacklisted-iemi-9.gif"                      alt="iPhone has bad esn"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1918666/19272" target="_top" id="1918666">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1918666" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1918666/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Take-it-apart-and-sell-the-spare-parts"><a href="#Take-it-apart-and-sell-the-spare-parts" class="headerlink" title="Take it apart and sell the spare parts"></a>Take it apart and sell the spare parts</h3><p>You can dismember the logic board, screen, dock connector and back casing, and sell them separately.

Verify that they are reputable and have a solid track record, as well as a range of positive reviews from previous customers.</li><li><strong><strong>IMEI Repair and Unlock Tools:</strong></strong> Some advanced users may consider IMEI repair software or unlock tools. However, utilizing these services could be illegal or fraudulent unless you are a certified technician who can verify the legitimacy of the software being used and the legality of the method in your region.</li><li><strong><strong>Seek Professional Repair Centers:</strong></strong> If all else fails, there are mobile repair shops that specialize in this type of work. It’s important to vet these services thoroughly, and ensure they are trained in such repairs and have a history of success.</li></ol><h3 id="Considerations-and-Warnings"><a href="#Considerations-and-Warnings" class="headerlink" title="Considerations and Warnings"></a>Considerations and Warnings</h3><ul><li><strong><strong>Device Warranty:</strong></strong> Unlocking a phone could void its warranty.

This 4-digit code protects your phone number from unauthorized calls, texts, and data use. It’s essential to change the default PIN to one that’s both memorable for you and difficult for others to guess.</p><p>So, <strong>how to change the PIN on an Android phone</strong>’s SIM card?

Unlike the PIN you use to unlock your phone, the SIM PIN code is a separate layer of security. If someone tries to use your SIM card in another phone without the correct PIN, they won’t be able to access your network or data.</p><p>Here are more reasons why <strong>changing the PIN code of a SIM card</strong> is a smart move:</p><ul><li>Default PINs are easy to guess</li></ul><p>Most carriers use generic PINs like “1234” or “0000”. Change it to something unique and harder to crack.</p><ul><li>Protects data in case of loss or theft</li></ul><p>If you lose your phone or it gets stolen, a strong PIN code hinders the thief’s ability to make calls, send messages, or access your data stored on the SIM. It buys you time to report the loss and block your SIM card before they can do any damage.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/02/how-to-change-pin-on-android-phone-02.jpg"                      alt="sim card locked"                ></p><ul><li>Prevents accidental PIN lockouts</li></ul><p>Using a memorable PIN minimizes the risk of accidentally locking yourself out of your SIM card.</p><ul><li>Peace of mind</li></ul><p>It is crucial if you store sensitive info on your SIM or use your phone for work. Knowing about this extra safeguard is reassuring, ensuring your data stays protected.</p><p><strong>Remember:</strong></p><p>Choose a PIN code for your SIM that’s easy for you to remember but challenging for others to guess. Avoid using birthdays, anniversaries, or other easily identifiable information. By taking a few minutes to <strong>change the PIN code of the SIM card</strong>, you’ll gain a significant security advantage for your new phone and data.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-To-Change-Pin-on-Android-Phone-SIM-Cards"><a href="#Part-2-How-To-Change-Pin-on-Android-Phone-SIM-Cards" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How To Change Pin on Android Phone SIM Cards?"></a>Part 2: How To Change Pin on Android Phone SIM Cards?</h2><p>Keeping your SIM card secure is crucial for protecting your data and privacy. Thankfully, Android allows you to easily change your SIM card PIN to a more personal and memorable code. But before you begin:</p><ul><li>Contact your network carrier to get your PUK code if you already have it. You’ll need this if you enter the wrong PIN three times and lock your SIM card.</li><li>Remember the temporary default PIN: Most SIM cards have a default PIN, often 1234 or 0123. If you haven’t changed it, this is the PIN you’ll use initially.</li></ul><p><strong>Note:</strong></p><p>Entering the wrong PIN three times will lock your SIM card. You’ll need your network carrier’s PUK code to unlock it. Use it cautiously, as exceeding the maximum number of attempts will permanently block your SIM card. So, it’s best to memorize your PIN or store it securely to avoid relying on the PUK altogether.</p><p>Steps To Change Your SIM PIN</p><p>Here’s <strong>how to find and manage the SIM PIN code on Android</strong>:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Navigate to your phone’s <strong>Settings</strong> app. Next, look for the <strong>Security and privacy</strong> or <strong>Lock screen and security</strong> (or other similar option) depending on your device’s model.</li><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Scroll down and tap on <strong>More security settings</strong> or <strong>Other security settings</strong>.</li><li><strong>Step 3:</strong> Tap <strong>SIM card security</strong> or <strong>Set up SIM card lock</strong> (or something similar).</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/02/how-to-change-pin-on-android-phone-03.jpg"                      alt="sim card security in settings"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2135368/19272" target="_top" id="2135368">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2135368" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="250" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2135368/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><ul><li><strong>Step 4:</strong> If you have multiple SIMs, select the one you want to change the PIN code.</li><li><strong>Step 5:</strong> Tap <strong>Change SIM PIN</strong>.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/02/how-to-change-pin-on-android-phone-04.jpg"                      alt="change sim pin code on android"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2043618/7443" target="_top" id="2043618">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2043618" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2043618/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><ul><li><strong>Step 6:</strong> Input your current SIM card PIN code and tap <strong>OK</strong>.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/02/how-to-change-pin-on-android-phone-05.jpg"                      alt="enter old sim pin"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Step 7:</strong> Enter your desired new PIN code and tap <strong>OK</strong>.</li><li><strong>Step 8:</strong> Re-enter your new SIM card PIN code and tap <strong>OK</strong> to confirm.</li></ul><p>Success!

Just try one of the following.</p><p><strong><em>Ask your Carrier to Unlock your Device</em></strong></p><p>This is the best option when you want to safely unlock your device. By February 2015, American cell phone owners got the option to request their carriers to unlock their device for them. Before that the law didn’t allow for carriers to unlock SIM cards in the United States. This unpopular law was reversed following a similar move by the European Union in 2013. The same law also requires that the carriers inform customers every month whether their device is eligible for unlocking.</p><p>If your device is eligible for unlocking, all you need to do is contact the carrier provide and request for the <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/unlock/unlock-samsung-sim-network-unlock-pin.html" >sim network unlock pin <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. But if your Smartphone was bought on a contract, you may need to pay a termination fee to break the contract of you want to unlock the Itel S23+ device before the contact term expires. For Smartphones that are not on contract, you have to wait 12 months from the date of purchase and ensure that your bill is paid before the carrier can give you the unlock code.</p><p><strong><em>How to Unlock your Android Phone</em></strong></p><p>To begin with, you need to confirm your IMEI number. Dial *#06# on your device and the IMEI number will appear on the screen. Copy this number to a secure location or wrote it down somewhere.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2016/06/14670084741192.jpg"                      alt="How to Unlock your Android Phone"                ></p><p>The next step is to find a reputable service that will unlock your Android device for you. This is action you should take only if you are absolutely desperate and your carrier can’t unlock your device for you. This is because many of these sites are unregulated and many of them are not reliable.</p><p>You should also know that many of them will charge a certain amount for your service.

The following are just some of the troubleshooting actions you can take if you encounter these problems.</p><p><strong><em>Unlocking Code Fails to work</em></strong></p><p>If you asked your carrier to unlock your device for you, chances are that they sent you a code. If the unlocking code fails to work double check that the IMEI number you used is the correct one and ensure that you purchased that device from that carrier and then try again.</p><p><strong><em>Samsung Device Freezes during unlocking</em></strong></p><p>If your device freezes during the unlocking process it typically means that you entered wrong unlocking code too many times. In this case you need to contact the carrier for a Master Code.</p><p><strong><em>My LG device won’t unlock</em></strong></p><p>There are some LG models that cannot be unlocked. These models include LG U300, LG U310, LG U8180, LG U8330, LG U8120, LG U8360, LG U8380, LGU880, and LG U890. If your device is one of these it can’t be unlocked by your carrier. You may need to look into other ways of unlocking your device.</p><h2 id="Three-Ways-to-Sim-Unlock-Itel-S23"><a href="#Three-Ways-to-Sim-Unlock-Itel-S23" class="headerlink" title="Three Ways to Sim Unlock Itel S23+"></a>Three Ways to Sim Unlock Itel S23+</h2><p>You probably purchased your Itel S23+ for a significant discount but are now stuck with the same network for a couple of years. You loved the Itel S23+ device but your network provider does not have any plans that exactly suit your needs. To release your device from your current network’s clutches, you will need to unlock your phone.</p><p>There are three ways you can do it and this post will go through each method so that you can find one that you are most comfortable with. Do note that if your contract has ended with your network provider, this “How to unlock Itel S23+” post can be skipped as you can just ask them to unlock your phone or purchase a <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/unlock/unlock-samsung-sim-network-unlock-pin.html" >sim network unlock pin <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> for a minimal price.</p><h2 id="Part-1-Itel-S23-Unlock-Code"><a href="#Part-1-Itel-S23-Unlock-Code" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Itel S23+ Unlock Code"></a>Part 1: Itel S23+ Unlock Code</h2><p>This is probably the easiest, no-fuss method to <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/unlock-android-screen/" >sim unlock <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> Itel S23+. Follow these steps carefully to successfully perform Itel S23+ unlock code.</p><p>Do take note that this process may not work with your carrier. Therefore, always check if this is the right way to obtain the necessary code:</p><ul><li>1.

Here I am going you present to you DoctorSIM - SIM Unlock Service. It definitely is one of the best sim unlocking code generators in the market. It helps you permanently sim unlock your phone so you can use it on any carrier provider you want in the world.</p><h3 id="How-to-use-SIM-Unlock-Service"><a href="#How-to-use-SIM-Unlock-Service" class="headerlink" title="How to use SIM Unlock Service"></a>How to use SIM Unlock Service</h3><p>Step 1. Visit Doctor - SIM Unlock Service official website, click on the Select Your Itel S23+ button, and then select Itel among all the phone brands.</p><p>Step 2. On the new window, fill in your phone IMEI number, model, your contact email, and other required information. Once your order is processed, the system will then send you the unlock code and instructions. You can follow the instruction to unlock your phone easily.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Itel-S23-Unlock-Carrier"><a href="#Part-3-Itel-S23-Unlock-Carrier" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Itel S23+ Unlock Carrier"></a>Part 3: Itel S23+ Unlock Carrier</h2><p>If your Itel S23+ is hard locked, this is your best bet in getting your device unlocked. Actually, it is the safest method among all three:</p><ol><li>Get a new SIM card from a new carrier.</li><li>Call your carrier’s customer service line and ask what are the requirements to qualify you to get your Itel S23+ unlocked. If you have honored your contract, there should not be any problems. However, do ask your carrier if there are any additional requirements. Do note that there may be fees involved.</li><li>Once your customer service representative has determined if you have met all their requirements, they should give you the SIM network unlock PIN Itel S23+. Again, depending on your carrier, they might either give you the code over the phone, through email or via SMS. If you have the choice, always opt for email or SMS so that you are able to jot down the right number.</li><li>Once you have gotten the code, insert the new SIM card (from your new carrier). You will receive a prompt to enter your code. Make sure that you key in the right code—entering the wrong code will cause your phone to be locked (possibly forever).</li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2016/08/unlock-screen.jpg"                      alt="sony unlock screen"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2135407/19272" target="_top" id="2135407">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2135407" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="120" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2135407/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-4-Itel-S23-Unlock-App-Software"><a href="#Part-4-Itel-S23-Unlock-App-Software" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: Itel S23+ Unlock App&#x2F;Software"></a>Part 4: Itel S23+ Unlock App&#x2F;Software</h2><p>There are some of us out there who are just not confident with doing things ourselves or trusting our own carrier.</p><p>HOWEVER, if your first instinct is to head to Google Play to look for SIM unlock tools, heed these cautions. There are currently many apps that claim that they can unlock your phone but it is just a scam. You should also avoid torrent files available online.

Therefore, if you travel frequently around the world, having an unlocked Itel S23+ would be beneficial. Using a local SIM card is much cheaper than paying for exorbitant roaming charges.</p><p>You can also benefit from an unlocked Itel S23+ if you are the kind of person who likes to take advantage of current offers provided by your local carriers. Prepaid plans are always changing in terms of offering so having the flexibility of changing carriers and prepaid plans can help you save money in the long run.</p><h2 id="Part-6-The-downside-of-an-unlocked-Itel-S23"><a href="#Part-6-The-downside-of-an-unlocked-Itel-S23" class="headerlink" title="Part 6: The downside of an unlocked Itel S23+"></a>Part 6: The downside of an unlocked Itel S23+</h2><p>Are you thinking “Well, why can’t I just buy an unlocked Itel S23+ in the first place?” right about now? Well, you can but think of the amount of money it will cost you.</p><p>For example, in Australia, an unlocked Itel S23+ will cost around $499 from any Itel outlet but $0 for the Itel S23+ device when you pair it with a 24-month postpaid plan. While this may look attractive now, you may be paying more for a locked Itel S23+ in the long run.</p><h2 id="Conclusion-1"><a href="#Conclusion-1" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>Now that you know the three ways of unlocking your Itel S23+, all you need to do is find one that is most compatible with you. Just remember to think of everything through and carefully. Most importantly, if you have a locked device, always seek advice from your carrier to see if this is possible.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins><br><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://youtube-docs.techidaily.com/issecting-video-ranking-algorithms-on-youtube-for-2024/"><u>[New] Dissecting Video Ranking Algorithms on YouTube for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-glue.techidaily.com/updated-maximum-memory-accessory-for-sony-a7s-ii/"><u>[Updated] Maximum Memory Accessory for Sony A7S II</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-sharing-recording.techidaily.com/updated-ultimate-top-ten-nintendo-switch-battle-titles-max-156/"><u>[Updated] Ultimate Top Ten Nintendo Switch Battle Titles (Max 156)</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tech-recovery.techidaily.com/enabling-kindles-read-anywhere-feature-tips-for-adding-the-mobile-app-to-your-devices/"><u>Enabling Kindle's Read Anywhere Feature: Tips for Adding the Mobile App to Your Devices</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-direct.techidaily.com/fun-filled-photography-how-to-use-lens-on-snapchat-for-playfulness-for-2024/"><u>Fun-Filled Photography How To Use Lens on Snapchat for Playfulness for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-mirror.techidaily.com/how-to-stream-anything-from-honor-x9b-to-apple-tv-drfone-by-drfone-android/"><u>How To Stream Anything From Honor X9b to Apple TV | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://change-location.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-to-get-the-dragon-scale-and-evolution-enabled-pokemon-on-samsung-galaxy-a34-5g-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>In 2024, How to get the dragon scale and evolution-enabled pokemon On Samsung Galaxy A34 5G? | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://sim-unlock.techidaily.com/in-2024-top-10-infinix-note-30-pro-android-sim-unlock-apk-by-drfone-android/"><u>In 2024, Top 10 Infinix Note 30 Pro Android SIM Unlock APK</u></a></li><li><a href="https://sim-unlock.techidaily.com/in-2024-top-10-tecno-spark-go-2023-android-sim-unlock-apk-by-drfone-android/"><u>In 2024, Top 10 Tecno Spark Go (2023) Android SIM Unlock APK</u></a></li><li><a href="https://sim-unlock.techidaily.com/in-2024-top-11-free-apps-to-check-imei-on-honor-90-pro-phones-by-drfone-android/"><u>In 2024, Top 11 Free Apps to Check IMEI on Honor 90 Pro Phones</u></a></li><li><a href="https://sim-unlock.techidaily.com/in-2024-top-imei-unlokers-for-your-honor-magic5-ultimate-phone-by-drfone-android/"><u>In 2024, Top IMEI Unlokers for Your Honor Magic5 Ultimate Phone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://sim-unlock.techidaily.com/in-2024-ways-to-find-unlocking-codes-for-tecno-phantom-v-flip-phones-by-drfone-android/"><u>In 2024, Ways To Find Unlocking Codes For Tecno Phantom V Flip Phones</u></a></li><li><a href="https://on-screen-recording.techidaily.com/master-zoom-recording-with-essential-gear/"><u>Master Zoom Recording with Essential Gear</u></a></li><li><a href="https://sim-unlock.techidaily.com/the-6-best-sim-unlock-services-that-actually-work-on-your-infinix-device-by-drfone-android/"><u>The 6 Best SIM Unlock Services That Actually Work On Your Infinix Device</u></a></li><li><a href="https://win-howtos.techidaily.com/the-ultimate-guide-to-restoring-system-health-in-windows-11-via-sfcdsim-strategies/"><u>The Ultimate Guide to Restoring System Health in Windows 11 via SFC/DSIM Strategies</u></a></li><li><a href="https://sim-unlock.techidaily.com/top-10-honor-magic5-ultimate-android-sim-unlock-apk-by-drfone-android/"><u>Top 10 Honor Magic5 Ultimate Android SIM Unlock APK</u></a></li><li><a href="https://sim-unlock.techidaily.com/tutorial-to-change-realme-narzo-60-pro-5g-imei-without-root-a-comprehensive-guide-by-drfone-android/"><u>Tutorial to Change Realme Narzo 60 Pro 5G IMEI without Root A Comprehensive Guide</u></a></li><li><a href="https://sim-unlock.techidaily.com/tutorial-to-change-tecno-spark-go-2023-imei-without-root-a-comprehensive-guide-by-drfone-android/"><u>Tutorial to Change Tecno Spark Go (2023) IMEI without Root A Comprehensive Guide</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ai-video-translation.techidaily.com/updated-netflix-subtitle-translation-methods-comprehensive-guide-for-2024/"><u>Updated Netflix Subtitle Translation Methods Comprehensive Guide for 2024</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

It is also more secure because if you are going via the carrier without a SIM card then you’ll need to back up your Apple iPhone 14, then delete and restore it as well (for security measures). This isn’t just a time consuming process, but it can also prove to be risky. Furthermore, AT&amp;T has a lot of checks and requisites in place which can keep your Apple iPhone 14 from being unlocked, and even if you do pass the requisites it’s still a time-consuming process which may still be rejected as AT&amp;T has final say.

It is a good idea to go through their requirements before you fill their form.</p><p>1. The obvious requirement is that your Apple iPhone 15 Plus must be locked to AT&amp;T, else you should go to the relevant carrier page.</p><p>2. You iPhone couldn’t have been reported as either lost or stolen.</p><p>3. No record of it having been linked to any criminal or fraudulent activities.</p><p>4. All termination fees have been paid in full, and all the other iPhone installment plans, etc, have been completed.</p><p>5. After upgrading iPhone you must wait 14 days before you’re eligible for unlock.</p><p>Finding out how to unlock AT&amp;T iPhone can be harrowing if you don’t know where to look, especially because performing the unlock can be so crucial for many people in order to access other carriers.</p><p>Both the options mentioned above offer a legitimate means by which you can AT&amp;T unlock your Apple iPhone 15 Plus, whether done without a SIM card or by contacting the AT&amp;T carrier.</p><p>However, going by personal experience the DoctorSIM alternative offers a much smoother, efficient and quicker alternative to contacting the AT&amp;T carriers. It is also more secure because if you are going via the carrier without a SIM card then you’ll need to back up your Apple iPhone 15 Plus, then delete and restore it as well (for security measures). This isn’t just a time consuming process, but it can also prove to be risky. Furthermore, AT&amp;T has a lot of checks and requisites in place which can keep your Apple iPhone 15 Plus from being unlocked, and even if you do pass the requisites it’s still a time-consuming process which may still be rejected as AT&amp;T has final say. As such, going via DoctorSIM gives you complete agency and conveniently AT&amp;T unlocks iPhone without any data loss, through a simple 3 step process.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins><br><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://twitter-videos.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-twittersphere-treasures-primes-top-watchers-and-likes/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved Twittersphere Treasures Prime’s Top Watchers & Likes</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-clips.techidaily.com/updated-beat-breakers-crafting-compelling-video-music-scores-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Beat Breakers Crafting Compelling Video Music Scores for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-sharing-recording.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-capturing-content-the-leading-online-television-recordings/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Capturing Content The Leading Online Television Recordings</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-tips.techidaily.com/ed-in-2024-expand-your-knowledge-elite-15-sci-yt-channels-list/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Expand Your Knowledge Elite 15 Sci-YT Channels List</u></a></li><li><a href="https://remote-screen-capture.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-voice-storage-test-report/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Voice Storage Test Report</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-blue.techidaily.com/updated-the-essential-guide-to-transferring-tunes-across-platforms-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] The Essential Guide to Transferring Tunes Across Platforms for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://technical-tips.techidaily.com/best-youthful-adventures-top-netflix-movie-picks-for-everyone/"><u>Best Youthful Adventures: Top Netflix Movie Picks for Everyone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://sim-unlock.techidaily.com/easily-unlock-your-itel-p55-device-sim-by-drfone-android/"><u>Easily Unlock Your Itel P55 Device SIM</u></a></li><li><a href="https://sim-unlock.techidaily.com/easily-unlock-your-nokia-g22-device-sim-by-drfone-android/"><u>Easily Unlock Your Nokia G22 Device SIM</u></a></li><li><a href="https://sim-unlock.techidaily.com/how-to-check-if-your-oppo-reno-11-pro-5g-is-unlocked-by-drfone-android/"><u>How To Check if Your Oppo Reno 11 Pro 5G Is Unlocked</u></a></li><li><a href="https://sim-unlock.techidaily.com/in-2024-three-ways-to-sim-unlock-vivo-v30-by-drfone-android/"><u>In 2024, Three Ways to Sim Unlock Vivo V30</u></a></li><li><a href="https://sim-unlock.techidaily.com/in-2024-top-11-free-apps-to-check-imei-on-motorola-razr-40-phones-by-drfone-android/"><u>In 2024, Top 11 Free Apps to Check IMEI on Motorola Razr 40 Phones</u></a></li><li><a href="https://sim-unlock.techidaily.com/in-2024-top-11-free-apps-to-check-imei-on-oppo-a58-4g-phones-by-drfone-android/"><u>In 2024, Top 11 Free Apps to Check IMEI on Oppo A58 4G Phones</u></a></li><li><a href="https://sim-unlock.techidaily.com/in-2024-top-11-free-apps-to-check-imei-on-vivo-t2-5g-phones-by-drfone-android/"><u>In 2024, Top 11 Free Apps to Check IMEI on Vivo T2 5G Phones</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-reviews.techidaily.com/lenovos-revolutionary-x1-fold-tablet-unveiled-a-comprehensive-examination/"><u>Lenovo's Revolutionary X1 Fold Tablet Unveiled: A Comprehensive Examination</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tech-hub.techidaily.com/navigate-to-the-foremost-international-torrent-sites-top-10-choices/"><u>Navigate To The Foremost International Torrent Sites: Top 10 Choices</u></a></li><li><a href="https://win-solutions.techidaily.com/solving-fortnite-out-of-vram-problem-expert-advice-on-optimizing-performance/"><u>Solving Fortnite Out of VRAM Problem: Expert Advice on Optimizing Performance</u></a></li><li><a href="https://sim-unlock.techidaily.com/the-best-android-unlock-software-for-vivo-y27s-device-top-5-picks-to-remove-android-locks-by-drfone-android/"><u>The Best Android Unlock Software For Vivo Y27s Device Top 5 Picks to Remove Android Locks</u></a></li><li><a href="https://sim-unlock.techidaily.com/three-ways-to-sim-unlock-vivo-t2-pro-5g-by-drfone-android/"><u>Three Ways to Sim Unlock Vivo T2 Pro 5G</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>
