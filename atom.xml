You loved the Poco C55 device but your network provider does not have any plans that exactly suit your needs. To release your device from your current network’s clutches, you will need to unlock your phone.</p><p>There are three ways you can do it and this post will go through each method so that you can find one that you are most comfortable with. Do note that if your contract has ended with your network provider, this “How to unlock Poco C55” post can be skipped as you can just ask them to unlock your phone or purchase a <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/unlock/unlock-samsung-sim-network-unlock-pin.html" >sim network unlock pin <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> for a minimal price.</p><h2 id="Part-1-Poco-C55-Unlock-Code"><a href="#Part-1-Poco-C55-Unlock-Code" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Poco C55 Unlock Code"></a>Part 1: Poco C55 Unlock Code</h2><p>This is probably the easiest, no-fuss method to <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/unlock-android-screen/" >sim unlock <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> Poco C55. Follow these steps carefully to successfully perform Poco C55 unlock code.</p><p>Do take note that this process may not work with your carrier. Therefore, always check if this is the right way to obtain the necessary code:</p><ul><li>1. Check the SIM lock status—you can do this by dialing <strong>*#*#7378423#*#*</strong>.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2016/08/14707989592943.jpg"                      alt="sony xperia unlock code"                ></p><ul><li>2. Tap <strong>Service info</strong> then <strong>Sim lock</strong>.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2016/08/14707989592897.jpg"                      alt="unlock with sony xperia unlock code"                ></p><ul><li>3. The number beside <strong>Network</strong> indicates how many attempts you have to unlock the phone. If it says ‘7’ it means you have seven attempts; ‘0’ simply means it is hard locked and cannot be unlocked using this method.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2016/08/14707989597664.jpg"                      alt="unlock code sony xperia"                ></p><ul><li>4. Find the <strong>IMEI number</strong> by dialing <strong>*#06#</strong>. Jot it down as this will be your code.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2016/08/14707998453087.jpg"                      alt="sony unlock code"                ></p><ul><li>5. Insert your new SIM card and tap in the IMEI number when it asks you for SIM network unlock PIN.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2016/08/unlock-screen.jpg"                      alt="sony unlock screen"                ></p><p>If you have followed these steps to a tee, you should have unlocked your device. If you had to abort after Step 2, look at the other two methods below.</p><h2 id="Part-2-The-Best-Poco-C55-SIM-Unlock-Code-Generator"><a href="#Part-2-The-Best-Poco-C55-SIM-Unlock-Code-Generator" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: The Best Poco C55 SIM Unlock Code Generator"></a>Part 2: The Best Poco C55 SIM Unlock Code Generator</h2><p>To safely and successfully sim unlock your Poco C55, it is important to find a trustworthy <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/unlock-android-screen/" >sim network unlock pin software <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. Here I am going you present to you DoctorSIM - SIM Unlock Service. It definitely is one of the best sim unlocking code generators in the market. It helps you permanently sim unlock your phone so you can use it on any carrier provider you want in the world.</p><h3 id="How-to-use-SIM-Unlock-Service"><a href="#How-to-use-SIM-Unlock-Service" class="headerlink" title="How to use SIM Unlock Service"></a>How to use SIM Unlock Service</h3><p>Step 1. Visit Doctor - SIM Unlock Service official website, click on the Select Your Poco C55 button, and then select Poco among all the phone brands.</p><p>Step 2. On the new window, fill in your phone IMEI number, model, your contact email, and other required information. Once your order is processed, the system will then send you the unlock code and instructions. You can follow the instruction to unlock your phone easily.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Poco-C55-Unlock-Carrier"><a href="#Part-3-Poco-C55-Unlock-Carrier" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Poco C55 Unlock Carrier"></a>Part 3: Poco C55 Unlock Carrier</h2><p>If your Poco C55 is hard locked, this is your best bet in getting your device unlocked. Actually, it is the safest method among all three:</p><ol><li>Get a new SIM card from a new carrier.</li><li>Call your carrier’s customer service line and ask what are the requirements to qualify you to get your Poco C55 unlocked. If you have honored your contract, there should not be any problems. However, do ask your carrier if there are any additional requirements. Do note that there may be fees involved.</li><li>Once your customer service representative has determined if you have met all their requirements, they should give you the SIM network unlock PIN Poco C55. Again, depending on your carrier, they might either give you the code over the phone, through email or via SMS. If you have the choice, always opt for email or SMS so that you are able to jot down the right number.</li><li>Once you have gotten the code, insert the new SIM card (from your new carrier). You will receive a prompt to enter your code. Make sure that you key in the right code—entering the wrong code will cause your phone to be locked (possibly forever).</li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2016/08/unlock-screen.jpg"                      alt="sony unlock screen"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2137227/26400" target="_top" id="2137227">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2137227" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/i/5597632/2137227/26400"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-4-Poco-C55-Unlock-App-Software"><a href="#Part-4-Poco-C55-Unlock-App-Software" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: Poco C55 Unlock App&#x2F;Software"></a>Part 4: Poco C55 Unlock App&#x2F;Software</h2><p>There are some of us out there who are just not confident with doing things ourselves or trusting our own carrier.</p><p>HOWEVER, if your first instinct is to head to Google Play to look for SIM unlock tools, heed these cautions. There are currently many apps that claim that they can unlock your phone but it is just a scam. You should also avoid torrent files available online. These apps and software are usually laced with Trojans and other types of malware. So do sort through the reviews so that you will not fall into a malicious trap.</p><p>One that we can attest to is  <strong><a class="link"   href="http://mymobileunlocking.com/" >MyMobileUnlocking.com <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong>; it is fast and affordable.

Therefore, if you travel frequently around the world, having an unlocked Poco C55 would be beneficial. Using a local SIM card is much cheaper than paying for exorbitant roaming charges.</p><p>You can also benefit from an unlocked Poco C55 if you are the kind of person who likes to take advantage of current offers provided by your local carriers. Prepaid plans are always changing in terms of offering so having the flexibility of changing carriers and prepaid plans can help you save money in the long run.</p><h2 id="Part-6-The-downside-of-an-unlocked-Poco-C55"><a href="#Part-6-The-downside-of-an-unlocked-Poco-C55" class="headerlink" title="Part 6: The downside of an unlocked Poco C55"></a>Part 6: The downside of an unlocked Poco C55</h2><p>Are you thinking “Well, why can’t I just buy an unlocked Poco C55 in the first place?” right about now? Well, you can but think of the amount of money it will cost you.</p><p>For example, in Australia, an unlocked Poco C55 will cost around $499 from any Poco outlet but $0 for the Poco C55 device when you pair it with a 24-month postpaid plan. While this may look attractive now, you may be paying more for a locked Poco C55 in the long run.</p><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>Now that you know the three ways of unlocking your Poco C55, all you need to do is find one that is most compatible with you. Just remember to think of everything through and carefully. Most importantly, if you have a locked device, always seek advice from your carrier to see if this is possible.</p><h2 id="Easily-Unlock-Your-Poco-C55-Device-SIM"><a href="#Easily-Unlock-Your-Poco-C55-Device-SIM" class="headerlink" title="Easily Unlock Your Poco C55 Device SIM"></a>Easily Unlock Your Poco C55 Device SIM</h2><p>Is your Android phone SIM locked? Having an unlocked device can have its benefits but most of the time most people don’t even know whether their device is SIM locked or not. In this article we are going to address this issue. We are going to begin by helping you find out whether your phone is locked or not and if it is, how you can <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/unlock-android-screen/" >sim unlock <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> the Poco C55 device and enjoy the benefits of an unlocked phone.</p><h2 id="Part-1-How-to-Know-if-your-Android-is-SIM-Locked"><a href="#Part-1-How-to-Know-if-your-Android-is-SIM-Locked" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: How to Know if your Android is SIM Locked"></a>Part 1: How to Know if your Android is SIM Locked</h2><p>It is important to note that not all phones are SIM locked. You can find out if yours is by checking the Poco C55 device’s documentation. If you see the words “unlocked” on the initial receipt then you know that the Poco C55 device is not SIM locked.</p><p>Another easy way to find out is to ask your carrier if the Poco C55 device is locked on to their network. You can also just try inserting another carrier’s SIM into your device. If it doesn’t work, you will know that the Poco C55 device is SIM locked.</p><p>If you bought your device from a third party re-seller such as Amazon you are more likely to be in possession of an unlocked device.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-SIM-Unlock-your-Android-Device"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-SIM-Unlock-your-Android-Device" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to SIM Unlock your Android Device"></a>Part 2: How to SIM Unlock your Android Device</h2><p>If you find that your SIM is locked, here’s a few things you can do to unlock the Poco C55 device.</p><p>Avoid all of the apps on the Google Play Store that promise to unlock your device, most of them don’t work and may even harbour a lot of Trojans and malware that will cause further problems for you and your device.</p><p>There are safe and very legal ways to unlock your device. Just try one of the following.</p><p><strong><em>Ask your Carrier to Unlock your Device</em></strong></p><p>This is the best option when you want to safely unlock your device. By February 2015, American cell phone owners got the option to request their carriers to unlock their device for them. Before that the law didn’t allow for carriers to unlock SIM cards in the United States. This unpopular law was reversed following a similar move by the European Union in 2013. The same law also requires that the carriers inform customers every month whether their device is eligible for unlocking.</p><p>If your device is eligible for unlocking, all you need to do is contact the carrier provide and request for the <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/unlock/unlock-samsung-sim-network-unlock-pin.html" >sim network unlock pin <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. But if your Smartphone was bought on a contract, you may need to pay a termination fee to break the contract of you want to unlock the Poco C55 device before the contact term expires. For Smartphones that are not on contract, you have to wait 12 months from the date of purchase and ensure that your bill is paid before the carrier can give you the unlock code.</p><p><strong><em>How to Unlock your Android Phone</em></strong></p><p>To begin with, you need to confirm your IMEI number. Dial *#06# on your device and the IMEI number will appear on the screen. Copy this number to a secure location or wrote it down somewhere.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2016/06/14670084741192.jpg"                      alt="How to Unlock your Android Phone"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/c/5597632/2134221/18498" target="_top" id="2134221">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18498-2134221" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/i/5597632/2134221/18498"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>The next step is to find a reputable service that will unlock your Android device for you. This is action you should take only if you are absolutely desperate and your carrier can’t unlock your device for you. This is because many of these sites are unregulated and many of them are not reliable.</p><p>You should also know that many of them will charge a certain amount for your service. You can try <a class="link"   href="https://www.safeunlockcode.com/" >https://www.safeunlockcode.com/ <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> which is one of the more reputable ones we have found.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2016/06/14670084936436.jpg"                      alt="android SIM unlock-safeunlockcode"                ></p><p>You will need to enter the IMEI number as part of the information you need to provide before they can unlock your device.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Troubleshooting-Android-SIM-Unlock"><a href="#Part-3-Troubleshooting-Android-SIM-Unlock" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Troubleshooting Android SIM Unlock"></a>Part 3: Troubleshooting Android SIM Unlock</h2><p>There are lots of issues you may face when you try to unlock your device. The following are just some of the troubleshooting actions you can take if you encounter these problems.</p><p><strong><em>Unlocking Code Fails to work</em></strong></p><p>If you asked your carrier to unlock your device for you, chances are that they sent you a code. If the unlocking code fails to work double check that the IMEI number you used is the correct one and ensure that you purchased that device from that carrier and then try again.</p><p><strong><em>Samsung Device Freezes during unlocking</em></strong></p><p>If your device freezes during the unlocking process it typically means that you entered wrong unlocking code too many times.

You loved the Nubia Z50 Ultra device but your network provider does not have any plans that exactly suit your needs. To release your device from your current network’s clutches, you will need to unlock your phone.</p><p>There are three ways you can do it and this post will go through each method so that you can find one that you are most comfortable with. Do note that if your contract has ended with your network provider, this “How to unlock Nubia Z50 Ultra” post can be skipped as you can just ask them to unlock your phone or purchase a <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/unlock/unlock-samsung-sim-network-unlock-pin.html" >sim network unlock pin <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> for a minimal price.</p><h2 id="Part-1-Nubia-Z50-Ultra-Unlock-Code"><a href="#Part-1-Nubia-Z50-Ultra-Unlock-Code" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Nubia Z50 Ultra Unlock Code"></a>Part 1: Nubia Z50 Ultra Unlock Code</h2><p>This is probably the easiest, no-fuss method to <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/unlock-android-screen/" >sim unlock <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> Nubia Z50 Ultra. Follow these steps carefully to successfully perform Nubia Z50 Ultra unlock code.</p><p>Do take note that this process may not work with your carrier. Therefore, always check if this is the right way to obtain the necessary code:</p><ul><li>1. Check the SIM lock status—you can do this by dialing <strong>*#*#7378423#*#*</strong>.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2016/08/14707989592943.jpg"                      alt="sony xperia unlock code"                ></p><ul><li>2. Tap <strong>Service info</strong> then <strong>Sim lock</strong>.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2016/08/14707989592897.jpg"                      alt="unlock with sony xperia unlock code"                ></p><ul><li>3. The number beside <strong>Network</strong> indicates how many attempts you have to unlock the phone. If it says ‘7’ it means you have seven attempts; ‘0’ simply means it is hard locked and cannot be unlocked using this method.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2016/08/14707989597664.jpg"                      alt="unlock code sony xperia"                ></p><ul><li>4. Find the <strong>IMEI number</strong> by dialing <strong>*#06#</strong>. Jot it down as this will be your code.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2016/08/14707998453087.jpg"                      alt="sony unlock code"                ></p><ul><li>5. Insert your new SIM card and tap in the IMEI number when it asks you for SIM network unlock PIN.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2016/08/unlock-screen.jpg"                      alt="sony unlock screen"                ></p><p>If you have followed these steps to a tee, you should have unlocked your device.

Visit Doctor - SIM Unlock Service official website, click on the Select Your Nubia Z50 Ultra button, and then select Nubia among all the phone brands.</p><p>Step 2. On the new window, fill in your phone IMEI number, model, your contact email, and other required information. Once your order is processed, the system will then send you the unlock code and instructions. You can follow the instruction to unlock your phone easily.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Nubia-Z50-Ultra-Unlock-Carrier"><a href="#Part-3-Nubia-Z50-Ultra-Unlock-Carrier" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Nubia Z50 Ultra Unlock Carrier"></a>Part 3: Nubia Z50 Ultra Unlock Carrier</h2><p>If your Nubia Z50 Ultra is hard locked, this is your best bet in getting your device unlocked. Actually, it is the safest method among all three:</p><ol><li>Get a new SIM card from a new carrier.</li><li>Call your carrier’s customer service line and ask what are the requirements to qualify you to get your Nubia Z50 Ultra unlocked. If you have honored your contract, there should not be any problems. However, do ask your carrier if there are any additional requirements. Do note that there may be fees involved.</li><li>Once your customer service representative has determined if you have met all their requirements, they should give you the SIM network unlock PIN Nubia Z50 Ultra. Again, depending on your carrier, they might either give you the code over the phone, through email or via SMS. If you have the choice, always opt for email or SMS so that you are able to jot down the right number.</li><li>Once you have gotten the code, insert the new SIM card (from your new carrier). You will receive a prompt to enter your code. Make sure that you key in the right code—entering the wrong code will cause your phone to be locked (possibly forever).</li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2016/08/unlock-screen.jpg"                      alt="sony unlock screen"                ></p><h2 id="Part-4-Nubia-Z50-Ultra-Unlock-App-Software"><a href="#Part-4-Nubia-Z50-Ultra-Unlock-App-Software" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: Nubia Z50 Ultra Unlock App&#x2F;Software"></a>Part 4: Nubia Z50 Ultra Unlock App&#x2F;Software</h2><p>There are some of us out there who are just not confident with doing things ourselves or trusting our own carrier.</p><p>HOWEVER, if your first instinct is to head to Google Play to look for SIM unlock tools, heed these cautions. There are currently many apps that claim that they can unlock your phone but it is just a scam. You should also avoid torrent files available online. These apps and software are usually laced with Trojans and other types of malware. So do sort through the reviews so that you will not fall into a malicious trap.</p><p>One that we can attest to is  <strong><a class="link"   href="http://mymobileunlocking.com/" >MyMobileUnlocking.com <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong>; it is fast and affordable.

Therefore, if you travel frequently around the world, having an unlocked Nubia Z50 Ultra would be beneficial. Using a local SIM card is much cheaper than paying for exorbitant roaming charges.</p><p>You can also benefit from an unlocked Nubia Z50 Ultra if you are the kind of person who likes to take advantage of current offers provided by your local carriers. Prepaid plans are always changing in terms of offering so having the flexibility of changing carriers and prepaid plans can help you save money in the long run.</p><h2 id="Part-6-The-downside-of-an-unlocked-Nubia-Z50-Ultra"><a href="#Part-6-The-downside-of-an-unlocked-Nubia-Z50-Ultra" class="headerlink" title="Part 6: The downside of an unlocked Nubia Z50 Ultra"></a>Part 6: The downside of an unlocked Nubia Z50 Ultra</h2><p>Are you thinking “Well, why can’t I just buy an unlocked Nubia Z50 Ultra in the first place?” right about now? Well, you can but think of the amount of money it will cost you.</p><p>For example, in Australia, an unlocked Nubia Z50 Ultra will cost around $499 from any Nubia outlet but $0 for the Nubia Z50 Ultra device when you pair it with a 24-month postpaid plan.

But your phone pops up with a request for a PIN code to unlock it. What’s that all about, and what do you enter? There are two main reasons why your phone might be asking for a SIM PIN or unlock code:</p><p>SIM Network Lock</p><p>The SIM Network Lock is a restriction placed by your phone’s original network provider, locking it to their network. It means you can only use the Nubia Z50 Ultra device with SIM cards from that specific carrier. Carriers use this to ensure that the phones they sell work only with their service. When you buy a subsidized phone, they want to ensure you stick around for the contract duration.</p><p>If you insert a SIM card from a different carrier, your phone will ask for a <strong>SIM Network Unlock PIN</strong> or Network Unlock Code (NUC). You’ll learn more about it in the upcoming sections of this article.</p><p>SIM Card Lock</p><p>SIM Card Lock is a security feature that protects your SIM card from unauthorized use on other devices. It requires you to enter a PIN (Personal Identification Number) to unlock the SIM card before you can use it.</p><p>The default PIN is usually printed on the back of the SIM card or its packaging. If you haven’t changed your PIN, use the 4-8 digit code provided by the carrier when you get your SIM card.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/02/sim-network-unlock-pin-02.jpg"                      alt="sim card lock pin"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2049379/7443" target="_top" id="2049379">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2049379" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2049379/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>If you’ve forgotten the <strong>SIM PIN code</strong>, you can use the PUK (PIN Unlock Key) code to unlock the SIM and set a new PIN.

Get Your Realme Note 50 Phone Network-Ready</h2><p>A network-locked device tethers you to one carrier, limiting your choices. You might miss out on better deals, struggle with roaming charges abroad, or feel inconvenienced by limited coverage. And you can’t avoid these things without the right <strong>SIM network unlock PIN</strong>.</p><p>That’s why we’ve created this comprehensive guide to help you unlock your phone’s potential. This article will explain what a <strong>SIM network unlock PIN</strong> is, the process involved, and answer any questions you might have. Keep scrolling to learn more.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/02/sim-network-unlock-pin-01.jpg"                      alt="enter sim network unlock pin"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-Why-Is-Your-Realme-Note-50-Asking-for-a-SIM-Network-Unlock-PIN"><a href="#Part-1-Why-Is-Your-Realme-Note-50-Asking-for-a-SIM-Network-Unlock-PIN" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Why Is Your Realme Note 50 Asking for a SIM Network Unlock PIN?"></a>Part 1: Why Is Your Realme Note 50 Asking for a SIM Network Unlock PIN?</h2><p>You just bought a new phone, excited to use it with a new SIM card. But your phone pops up with a request for a PIN code to unlock it. What’s that all about, and what do you enter? There are two main reasons why your phone might be asking for a SIM PIN or unlock code:</p><p>SIM Network Lock</p><p>The SIM Network Lock is a restriction placed by your phone’s original network provider, locking it to their network. It means you can only use the Realme Note 50 device with SIM cards from that specific carrier. Carriers use this to ensure that the phones they sell work only with their service. When you buy a subsidized phone, they want to ensure you stick around for the contract duration.</p><p>If you insert a SIM card from a different carrier, your phone will ask for a <strong>SIM Network Unlock PIN</strong> or Network Unlock Code (NUC). You’ll learn more about it in the upcoming sections of this article.</p><p>SIM Card Lock</p><p>SIM Card Lock is a security feature that protects your SIM card from unauthorized use on other devices. It requires you to enter a PIN (Personal Identification Number) to unlock the SIM card before you can use it.</p><p>The default PIN is usually printed on the back of the SIM card or its packaging. If you haven’t changed your PIN, use the 4-8 digit code provided by the carrier when you get your SIM card.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/02/sim-network-unlock-pin-02.jpg"                      alt="sim card lock pin"                ></p><p>If you’ve forgotten the <strong>SIM PIN code</strong>, you can use the PUK (PIN Unlock Key) code to unlock the SIM and set a new PIN. The PUK code is also printed on the SIM card packaging, but be careful, as entering the wrong PUK code too many times can permanently lock the SIM card.</p><p>Not knowing the <strong>SIM unlock PIN</strong> code can be frustrating, especially if you want to switch mobile carriers. So, in the next part, we’ll explore whether it’s possible to unlock a SIM network-locked iPhone device.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Can-a-SIM-Network-Locked-iPhone-Be-Unlocked"><a href="#Part-2-Can-a-SIM-Network-Locked-iPhone-Be-Unlocked" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Can a SIM Network Locked iPhone Be Unlocked?"></a>Part 2: Can a SIM Network Locked iPhone Be Unlocked?</h2><p>Yes, a SIM network-locked iPhone can be unlocked by your network provider. Insert a new SIM card, and you’ll be prompted to enter the <strong>SIM Network Unlock PIN</strong>. After inputting the correct unlock code, your iPhone is ready to use with any carrier.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/02/sim-network-unlock-pin-03.jpg"                      alt="sim not valid message on iphone"                ></p><p>If you are thinking about unlocking your iPhone, it’s crucial to grasp what a <strong>SIM Network Unlock PIN</strong> is and how it functions.</p><h2 id="Part-3-What-Is-a-SIM-Network-Unlock-PIN"><a href="#Part-3-What-Is-a-SIM-Network-Unlock-PIN" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: What Is a SIM Network Unlock PIN?"></a>Part 3: What Is a SIM Network Unlock PIN?</h2><p>A <strong>SIM network unlock PIN</strong> is a code allowing you to remove your phone’s network lock. It means you can use your phone with a SIM card from any compatible network provider, not just the one you originally bought it from. It is also known as Network Unlock PIN (NUP), Network Control Key (NCK), or Network Unlock Code (NUC).</p><p>Unlocking your device can be useful if you:</p><ul><li>Bought a phone locked to a specific carrier and want to switch to a different one.</li><li>Are planning a trip abroad and want to use a local SIM card instead.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/02/sim-network-unlock-pin-04.jpg"                      alt="international travel illustration"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2016148/19272" target="_top" id="2016148">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2016148" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2016148/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><ul><li>Still haven’t finished your contract with your original carrier and want to keep the phone but use a different service.</li><li>Bought a phone second-hand locked to the previous owner’s network.</li><li>Want to increase your phone’s resale value; unlocked phones generally have a higher resale value than locked phones, as various buyers can use them.</li><li>Want more carrier flexibility; you are not tied to one carrier and can choose the provider that best suits your needs in terms of price, coverage, data plans, and other features.</li></ul><p>Things To Consider</p><p>Before you proceed, here are some key points to remember:</p><ul><li>Eligibility: Not all phones are eligible for network unlocking. Check with your carrier or manufacturer for details.</li><li>Costs: While some carriers can give <strong>SIM network unlock PIN for free</strong>, others may charge a fee. Third-party unlocking services also typically charge a fee.</li><li>Waiting time: It can take days or even weeks to receive your <strong>SIM unlock PIN</strong>code from your carrier and process it. For instance, Vodafone usually unlocks the Realme Note 50 device within 72 hours to 10 days if they have to reach the manufacturer.</li><li>Risks: Using an unauthorized unlocking method could damage your phone or void its warranty.</li><li>Backup: Before unlocking your phone, back up your data, as the process may erase it.</li></ul><p>Now that you understand <strong>SIM Network Unlock PIN</strong>, let’s get down to business!

However, there are ways to unlock your phone without granting permission from the network.</p><h3 id="Rooting-for-Android"><a href="#Rooting-for-Android" class="headerlink" title="Rooting (for Android)"></a>Rooting (for Android)</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/09/root-android.jpg"                      alt="androi root"                ></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/root/reasons-to-root-android.html" >Rooting a phone <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> means gaining “root access” on another phone. <strong>This process works for Android only.</strong> However, it can also be used on some specific Linux-based devices. Root access allows you to do almost everything on the phone you’ve gained access to, like installing or uninstalling applications or changing the settings.</p><p>Root access is not all fun, and games as this process will lead you to the security architect of your operating system, which will be hard to deal with even if you’re a professional.

Get Your Infinix Note 30 5G Phone Network-Ready</h2><p>A network-locked device tethers you to one carrier, limiting your choices. You might miss out on better deals, struggle with roaming charges abroad, or feel inconvenienced by limited coverage. And you can’t avoid these things without the right <strong>SIM network unlock PIN</strong>.</p><p>That’s why we’ve created this comprehensive guide to help you unlock your phone’s potential. This article will explain what a <strong>SIM network unlock PIN</strong> is, the process involved, and answer any questions you might have. Keep scrolling to learn more.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/02/sim-network-unlock-pin-01.jpg"                      alt="enter sim network unlock pin"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-Why-Is-Your-Infinix-Note-30-5G-Asking-for-a-SIM-Network-Unlock-PIN"><a href="#Part-1-Why-Is-Your-Infinix-Note-30-5G-Asking-for-a-SIM-Network-Unlock-PIN" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Why Is Your Infinix Note 30 5G Asking for a SIM Network Unlock PIN?"></a>Part 1: Why Is Your Infinix Note 30 5G Asking for a SIM Network Unlock PIN?</h2><p>You just bought a new phone, excited to use it with a new SIM card. But your phone pops up with a request for a PIN code to unlock it. What’s that all about, and what do you enter? There are two main reasons why your phone might be asking for a SIM PIN or unlock code:</p><p>SIM Network Lock</p><p>The SIM Network Lock is a restriction placed by your phone’s original network provider, locking it to their network. It means you can only use the Infinix Note 30 5G device with SIM cards from that specific carrier. Carriers use this to ensure that the phones they sell work only with their service. When you buy a subsidized phone, they want to ensure you stick around for the contract duration.</p><p>If you insert a SIM card from a different carrier, your phone will ask for a <strong>SIM Network Unlock PIN</strong> or Network Unlock Code (NUC). You’ll learn more about it in the upcoming sections of this article.</p><p>SIM Card Lock</p><p>SIM Card Lock is a security feature that protects your SIM card from unauthorized use on other devices. It requires you to enter a PIN (Personal Identification Number) to unlock the SIM card before you can use it.</p><p>The default PIN is usually printed on the back of the SIM card or its packaging. If you haven’t changed your PIN, use the 4-8 digit code provided by the carrier when you get your SIM card.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/02/sim-network-unlock-pin-02.jpg"                      alt="sim card lock pin"                ></p><p>If you’ve forgotten the <strong>SIM PIN code</strong>, you can use the PUK (PIN Unlock Key) code to unlock the SIM and set a new PIN. The PUK code is also printed on the SIM card packaging, but be careful, as entering the wrong PUK code too many times can permanently lock the SIM card.</p><p>Not knowing the <strong>SIM unlock PIN</strong> code can be frustrating, especially if you want to switch mobile carriers. So, in the next part, we’ll explore whether it’s possible to unlock a SIM network-locked iPhone device.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Can-a-SIM-Network-Locked-iPhone-Be-Unlocked"><a href="#Part-2-Can-a-SIM-Network-Locked-iPhone-Be-Unlocked" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Can a SIM Network Locked iPhone Be Unlocked?"></a>Part 2: Can a SIM Network Locked iPhone Be Unlocked?</h2><p>Yes, a SIM network-locked iPhone can be unlocked by your network provider. Insert a new SIM card, and you’ll be prompted to enter the <strong>SIM Network Unlock PIN</strong>. After inputting the correct unlock code, your iPhone is ready to use with any carrier.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/02/sim-network-unlock-pin-03.jpg"                      alt="sim not valid message on iphone"                ></p><p>If you are thinking about unlocking your iPhone, it’s crucial to grasp what a <strong>SIM Network Unlock PIN</strong> is and how it functions.</p><h2 id="Part-3-What-Is-a-SIM-Network-Unlock-PIN"><a href="#Part-3-What-Is-a-SIM-Network-Unlock-PIN" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: What Is a SIM Network Unlock PIN?"></a>Part 3: What Is a SIM Network Unlock PIN?</h2><p>A <strong>SIM network unlock PIN</strong> is a code allowing you to remove your phone’s network lock. It means you can use your phone with a SIM card from any compatible network provider, not just the one you originally bought it from. It is also known as Network Unlock PIN (NUP), Network Control Key (NCK), or Network Unlock Code (NUC).</p><p>Unlocking your device can be useful if you:</p><ul><li>Bought a phone locked to a specific carrier and want to switch to a different one.</li><li>Are planning a trip abroad and want to use a local SIM card instead.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/02/sim-network-unlock-pin-04.jpg"                      alt="international travel illustration"                ></p><ul><li>Still haven’t finished your contract with your original carrier and want to keep the phone but use a different service.</li><li>Bought a phone second-hand locked to the previous owner’s network.</li><li>Want to increase your phone’s resale value; unlocked phones generally have a higher resale value than locked phones, as various buyers can use them.</li><li>Want more carrier flexibility; you are not tied to one carrier and can choose the provider that best suits your needs in terms of price, coverage, data plans, and other features.</li></ul><p>Things To Consider</p><p>Before you proceed, here are some key points to remember:</p><ul><li>Eligibility: Not all phones are eligible for network unlocking. Check with your carrier or manufacturer for details.</li><li>Costs: While some carriers can give <strong>SIM network unlock PIN for free</strong>, others may charge a fee. Third-party unlocking services also typically charge a fee.</li><li>Waiting time: It can take days or even weeks to receive your <strong>SIM unlock PIN</strong>code from your carrier and process it. For instance, Vodafone usually unlocks the Infinix Note 30 5G device within 72 hours to 10 days if they have to reach the manufacturer.</li><li>Risks: Using an unauthorized unlocking method could damage your phone or void its warranty.</li><li>Backup: Before unlocking your phone, back up your data, as the process may erase it.</li></ul><p>Now that you understand <strong>SIM Network Unlock PIN</strong>, let’s get down to business! In the final part, we’ll guide you through the two ways of unlocking your iPhone for a new carrier.</p><h2 id="Part-4-How-To-Unlock-Your-iPhone-for-a-New-Carrier"><a href="#Part-4-How-To-Unlock-Your-iPhone-for-a-New-Carrier" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: How To Unlock Your iPhone for a New Carrier?"></a>Part 4: How To Unlock Your iPhone for a New Carrier?</h2><p>Ready to unlock your iPhone and explore your carrier options?

Get Your Realme GT Neo 5 SE Phone Network-Ready</h2><p>A network-locked device tethers you to one carrier, limiting your choices. You might miss out on better deals, struggle with roaming charges abroad, or feel inconvenienced by limited coverage. And you can’t avoid these things without the right <strong>SIM network unlock PIN</strong>.</p><p>That’s why we’ve created this comprehensive guide to help you unlock your phone’s potential. This article will explain what a <strong>SIM network unlock PIN</strong> is, the process involved, and answer any questions you might have. Keep scrolling to learn more.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/02/sim-network-unlock-pin-01.jpg"                      alt="enter sim network unlock pin"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-Why-Is-Your-Realme-GT-Neo-5-SE-Asking-for-a-SIM-Network-Unlock-PIN"><a href="#Part-1-Why-Is-Your-Realme-GT-Neo-5-SE-Asking-for-a-SIM-Network-Unlock-PIN" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Why Is Your Realme GT Neo 5 SE Asking for a SIM Network Unlock PIN?"></a>Part 1: Why Is Your Realme GT Neo 5 SE Asking for a SIM Network Unlock PIN?</h2><p>You just bought a new phone, excited to use it with a new SIM card. But your phone pops up with a request for a PIN code to unlock it. What’s that all about, and what do you enter? There are two main reasons why your phone might be asking for a SIM PIN or unlock code:</p><p>SIM Network Lock</p><p>The SIM Network Lock is a restriction placed by your phone’s original network provider, locking it to their network. It means you can only use the Realme GT Neo 5 SE device with SIM cards from that specific carrier. Carriers use this to ensure that the phones they sell work only with their service. When you buy a subsidized phone, they want to ensure you stick around for the contract duration.</p><p>If you insert a SIM card from a different carrier, your phone will ask for a <strong>SIM Network Unlock PIN</strong> or Network Unlock Code (NUC). You’ll learn more about it in the upcoming sections of this article.</p><p>SIM Card Lock</p><p>SIM Card Lock is a security feature that protects your SIM card from unauthorized use on other devices. It requires you to enter a PIN (Personal Identification Number) to unlock the SIM card before you can use it.</p><p>The default PIN is usually printed on the back of the SIM card or its packaging. If you haven’t changed your PIN, use the 4-8 digit code provided by the carrier when you get your SIM card.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/02/sim-network-unlock-pin-02.jpg"                      alt="sim card lock pin"                ></p><p>If you’ve forgotten the <strong>SIM PIN code</strong>, you can use the PUK (PIN Unlock Key) code to unlock the SIM and set a new PIN. The PUK code is also printed on the SIM card packaging, but be careful, as entering the wrong PUK code too many times can permanently lock the SIM card.</p><p>Not knowing the <strong>SIM unlock PIN</strong> code can be frustrating, especially if you want to switch mobile carriers. So, in the next part, we’ll explore whether it’s possible to unlock a SIM network-locked iPhone device.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Can-a-SIM-Network-Locked-iPhone-Be-Unlocked"><a href="#Part-2-Can-a-SIM-Network-Locked-iPhone-Be-Unlocked" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Can a SIM Network Locked iPhone Be Unlocked?"></a>Part 2: Can a SIM Network Locked iPhone Be Unlocked?</h2><p>Yes, a SIM network-locked iPhone can be unlocked by your network provider. Insert a new SIM card, and you’ll be prompted to enter the <strong>SIM Network Unlock PIN</strong>. After inputting the correct unlock code, your iPhone is ready to use with any carrier.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/02/sim-network-unlock-pin-03.jpg"                      alt="sim not valid message on iphone"                ></p><p>If you are thinking about unlocking your iPhone, it’s crucial to grasp what a <strong>SIM Network Unlock PIN</strong> is and how it functions.</p><h2 id="Part-3-What-Is-a-SIM-Network-Unlock-PIN"><a href="#Part-3-What-Is-a-SIM-Network-Unlock-PIN" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: What Is a SIM Network Unlock PIN?"></a>Part 3: What Is a SIM Network Unlock PIN?</h2><p>A <strong>SIM network unlock PIN</strong> is a code allowing you to remove your phone’s network lock. It means you can use your phone with a SIM card from any compatible network provider, not just the one you originally bought it from. It is also known as Network Unlock PIN (NUP), Network Control Key (NCK), or Network Unlock Code (NUC).</p><p>Unlocking your device can be useful if you:</p><ul><li>Bought a phone locked to a specific carrier and want to switch to a different one.</li><li>Are planning a trip abroad and want to use a local SIM card instead.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/02/sim-network-unlock-pin-04.jpg"                      alt="international travel illustration"                ></p><ul><li>Still haven’t finished your contract with your original carrier and want to keep the phone but use a different service.</li><li>Bought a phone second-hand locked to the previous owner’s network.</li><li>Want to increase your phone’s resale value; unlocked phones generally have a higher resale value than locked phones, as various buyers can use them.</li><li>Want more carrier flexibility; you are not tied to one carrier and can choose the provider that best suits your needs in terms of price, coverage, data plans, and other features.</li></ul><p>Things To Consider</p><p>Before you proceed, here are some key points to remember:</p><ul><li>Eligibility: Not all phones are eligible for network unlocking. Check with your carrier or manufacturer for details.</li><li>Costs: While some carriers can give <strong>SIM network unlock PIN for free</strong>, others may charge a fee. Third-party unlocking services also typically charge a fee.</li><li>Waiting time: It can take days or even weeks to receive your <strong>SIM unlock PIN</strong>code from your carrier and process it. For instance, Vodafone usually unlocks the Realme GT Neo 5 SE device within 72 hours to 10 days if they have to reach the manufacturer.</li><li>Risks: Using an unauthorized unlocking method could damage your phone or void its warranty.</li><li>Backup: Before unlocking your phone, back up your data, as the process may erase it.</li></ul><p>Now that you understand <strong>SIM Network Unlock PIN</strong>, let’s get down to business! In the final part, we’ll guide you through the two ways of unlocking your iPhone for a new carrier.</p><h2 id="Part-4-How-To-Unlock-Your-iPhone-for-a-New-Carrier"><a href="#Part-4-How-To-Unlock-Your-iPhone-for-a-New-Carrier" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: How To Unlock Your iPhone for a New Carrier?"></a>Part 4: How To Unlock Your iPhone for a New Carrier?</h2><p>Ready to unlock your iPhone and explore your carrier options?

Resetting these errors can help unlock your <strong>network locked SIM card inserted</strong> device. Service providers decided to provide a formal SIM unlocking option as a result.</p><p>Because of this, any locked SIM may be readily unlocked, and once a device opens, it can work like a conventional mobile phone and with any SIM card of the user’s choosing.</p><p><strong>Carrier Lock</strong></p><p>The consumer must stick with the same service provider for a specific time after purchasing the bundled device and data pack. This is called a carrier lock on the Realme GT Neo 5 SE device and is one of the most common errors in <strong>network locked SIM card inserted</strong> devices. During that time, the Realme GT Neo 5 SE device will be network- or SIM-locked, prohibiting the user from changing service providers.</p><p>The user cannot change the SIM. The service provider will offer the SIM Unlock code needed to unlock the handset when the contract expires. The gadget can be used with any other SIM card and exported to another country without problems when the network lock has been removed.</p><p><strong>Region Lock</strong></p><p>Apple and AT&amp;T initially worked together to implement the SIM lock and the SIM locked devices. The original purpose was to force the user to continue using the same service provider in a specific area or time.</p><p>However, some telecom service providers sell the handsets with select data plans as bundled plans in collaboration with the Realme GT Neo 5 SE device manufacturers. As a result, the handset will cost less than it would otherwise. Sometimes, these offers are particular to a specific region, called a carrier lock.</p><p><strong>Firmware Problems</strong></p><p>Sometimes, the Realme GT Neo 5 SE device manufacturers release many versions of the same firmware for different geographical locations.</p><p>As a result, it may be possible that the user may face contradictions in the agreement of device firmware and the network-locked SIM card that was supposed to be used on the Realme GT Neo 5 SE device. Due to firmware problems, the users may also face a network-locked SIM card-inserted device.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/11/fix-network-locked-simcard-inserted-03.png"                      alt="unlock sim card"                ></p><h2 id="Part-3-How-to-Unlock-Network-Locked-SIM-Card-Inserted"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-Unlock-Network-Locked-SIM-Card-Inserted" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How to Unlock Network Locked SIM Card Inserted?"></a>Part 3: How to Unlock Network Locked SIM Card Inserted?</h2><p>Unlocking a network-locked SIM card may seem like a complex task.

This guarantees that the Realme GT Neo 5 SE device is only being used with the original SIM card for each provider. This locking also has a lot of drawbacks because it is incompatible with any other SIM card.</p><ol><li>The phone cannot be used with other SIM cards if the SIM lock is enabled. Customers must therefore adhere to the current plan as is.</li><li>Since nobody wants to purchase a locked phone, it is hard for someone to sell or gift the mobile.</li><li>Traveling abroad with a SIM-locked phone could provide some challenges because you won’t be able to use a local SIM card on the phone while you’re there.</li></ol><p>All the problems can be fixed, and the SIM works in any nation with the removed SIM lock.</p><h3 id="Conclusion-1"><a href="#Conclusion-1" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h3><p>Any of the methods above can work to get around the prohibition against using other SIM cards with your Android handset.

You loved the Realme 12 5G device but your network provider does not have any plans that exactly suit your needs. To release your device from your current network’s clutches, you will need to unlock your phone.</p><p>There are three ways you can do it and this post will go through each method so that you can find one that you are most comfortable with. Do note that if your contract has ended with your network provider, this “How to unlock Realme 12 5G” post can be skipped as you can just ask them to unlock your phone or purchase a <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/unlock/unlock-samsung-sim-network-unlock-pin.html" >sim network unlock pin <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> for a minimal price.</p><h2 id="Part-1-Realme-12-5G-Unlock-Code"><a href="#Part-1-Realme-12-5G-Unlock-Code" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Realme 12 5G Unlock Code"></a>Part 1: Realme 12 5G Unlock Code</h2><p>This is probably the easiest, no-fuss method to <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/unlock-android-screen/" >sim unlock <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> Realme 12 5G. Follow these steps carefully to successfully perform Realme 12 5G unlock code.</p><p>Do take note that this process may not work with your carrier. Therefore, always check if this is the right way to obtain the necessary code:</p><ul><li>1. Check the SIM lock status—you can do this by dialing <strong>*#*#7378423#*#*</strong>.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2016/08/14707989592943.jpg"                      alt="sony xperia unlock code"                ></p><ul><li>2. Tap <strong>Service info</strong> then <strong>Sim lock</strong>.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2016/08/14707989592897.jpg"                      alt="unlock with sony xperia unlock code"                ></p><ul><li>3. The number beside <strong>Network</strong> indicates how many attempts you have to unlock the phone. If it says ‘7’ it means you have seven attempts; ‘0’ simply means it is hard locked and cannot be unlocked using this method.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2016/08/14707989597664.jpg"                      alt="unlock code sony xperia"                ></p><ul><li>4. Find the <strong>IMEI number</strong> by dialing <strong>*#06#</strong>. Jot it down as this will be your code.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2016/08/14707998453087.jpg"                      alt="sony unlock code"                ></p><ul><li>5. Insert your new SIM card and tap in the IMEI number when it asks you for SIM network unlock PIN.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2016/08/unlock-screen.jpg"                      alt="sony unlock screen"                ></p><p>If you have followed these steps to a tee, you should have unlocked your device. If you had to abort after Step 2, look at the other two methods below.</p><h2 id="Part-2-The-Best-Realme-12-5G-SIM-Unlock-Code-Generator"><a href="#Part-2-The-Best-Realme-12-5G-SIM-Unlock-Code-Generator" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: The Best Realme 12 5G SIM Unlock Code Generator"></a>Part 2: The Best Realme 12 5G SIM Unlock Code Generator</h2><p>To safely and successfully sim unlock your Realme 12 5G, it is important to find a trustworthy <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/unlock-android-screen/" >sim network unlock pin software <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. Here I am going you present to you DoctorSIM - SIM Unlock Service. It definitely is one of the best sim unlocking code generators in the market. It helps you permanently sim unlock your phone so you can use it on any carrier provider you want in the world.</p><h3 id="How-to-use-SIM-Unlock-Service"><a href="#How-to-use-SIM-Unlock-Service" class="headerlink" title="How to use SIM Unlock Service"></a>How to use SIM Unlock Service</h3><p>Step 1. Visit Doctor - SIM Unlock Service official website, click on the Select Your Realme 12 5G button, and then select Realme among all the phone brands.</p><p>Step 2. On the new window, fill in your phone IMEI number, model, your contact email, and other required information. Once your order is processed, the system will then send you the unlock code and instructions. You can follow the instruction to unlock your phone easily.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Realme-12-5G-Unlock-Carrier"><a href="#Part-3-Realme-12-5G-Unlock-Carrier" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Realme 12 5G Unlock Carrier"></a>Part 3: Realme 12 5G Unlock Carrier</h2><p>If your Realme 12 5G is hard locked, this is your best bet in getting your device unlocked. Actually, it is the safest method among all three:</p><ol><li>Get a new SIM card from a new carrier.</li><li>Call your carrier’s customer service line and ask what are the requirements to qualify you to get your Realme 12 5G unlocked. If you have honored your contract, there should not be any problems. However, do ask your carrier if there are any additional requirements. Do note that there may be fees involved.</li><li>Once your customer service representative has determined if you have met all their requirements, they should give you the SIM network unlock PIN Realme 12 5G. Again, depending on your carrier, they might either give you the code over the phone, through email or via SMS. If you have the choice, always opt for email or SMS so that you are able to jot down the right number.</li><li>Once you have gotten the code, insert the new SIM card (from your new carrier). You will receive a prompt to enter your code. Make sure that you key in the right code—entering the wrong code will cause your phone to be locked (possibly forever).</li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2016/08/unlock-screen.jpg"                      alt="sony unlock screen"                ></p><h2 id="Part-4-Realme-12-5G-Unlock-App-Software"><a href="#Part-4-Realme-12-5G-Unlock-App-Software" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: Realme 12 5G Unlock App&#x2F;Software"></a>Part 4: Realme 12 5G Unlock App&#x2F;Software</h2><p>There are some of us out there who are just not confident with doing things ourselves or trusting our own carrier.</p><p>HOWEVER, if your first instinct is to head to Google Play to look for SIM unlock tools, heed these cautions. There are currently many apps that claim that they can unlock your phone but it is just a scam. You should also avoid torrent files available online. These apps and software are usually laced with Trojans and other types of malware. So do sort through the reviews so that you will not fall into a malicious trap.</p><p>One that we can attest to is  <strong><a class="link"   href="http://mymobileunlocking.com/" >MyMobileUnlocking.com <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong>; it is fast and affordable.

Therefore, if you travel frequently around the world, having an unlocked Realme 12 5G would be beneficial. Using a local SIM card is much cheaper than paying for exorbitant roaming charges.</p><p>You can also benefit from an unlocked Realme 12 5G if you are the kind of person who likes to take advantage of current offers provided by your local carriers. Prepaid plans are always changing in terms of offering so having the flexibility of changing carriers and prepaid plans can help you save money in the long run.</p><h2 id="Part-6-The-downside-of-an-unlocked-Realme-12-5G"><a href="#Part-6-The-downside-of-an-unlocked-Realme-12-5G" class="headerlink" title="Part 6: The downside of an unlocked Realme 12 5G"></a>Part 6: The downside of an unlocked Realme 12 5G</h2><p>Are you thinking “Well, why can’t I just buy an unlocked Realme 12 5G in the first place?” right about now? Well, you can but think of the amount of money it will cost you.</p><p>For example, in Australia, an unlocked Realme 12 5G will cost around $499 from any Realme outlet but $0 for the Realme 12 5G device when you pair it with a 24-month postpaid plan. While this may look attractive now, you may be paying more for a locked Realme 12 5G in the long run.</p><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>Now that you know the three ways of unlocking your Realme 12 5G, all you need to do is find one that is most compatible with you. Just remember to think of everything through and carefully. Most importantly, if you have a locked device, always seek advice from your carrier to see if this is possible.</p><h2 id="How-To-Unlock-SIM-Cards-Of-Realme-12-5G-Without-PUK-Codes"><a href="#How-To-Unlock-SIM-Cards-Of-Realme-12-5G-Without-PUK-Codes" class="headerlink" title="How To Unlock SIM Cards Of Realme 12 5G Without PUK Codes"></a>How To Unlock SIM Cards Of Realme 12 5G Without PUK Codes</h2><p>Unintentionally locking your SIM card with an incorrect PIN is a common occurrence. It’s frustrating because it prevents you from accessing your essential mobile services. Thankfully, Personal Unblocking Key (PUK) codes offer a way to unlock it. However, what happens if you lose them?</p><p>This comprehensive guide explores <strong>how to unlock SIM cards without the PUK Codes</strong>. Whether you’re a techie or a tech noob, you’ll be sure to find easy solutions in this article. From directly contacting your mobile carrier to utilizing alternative unlocking techniques, you will see clear and concise instructions that empower you to navigate this technical hurdle.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/02/unlock-sim-without-puk-code-01.jpg"                      alt="back of sim packaging puk code"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-Official-Ways-To-Unlock-SIM-Cards-With-a-Lost-PUK-Code"><a href="#Part-1-Official-Ways-To-Unlock-SIM-Cards-With-a-Lost-PUK-Code" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Official Ways To Unlock SIM Cards With a Lost PUK Code"></a>Part 1: Official Ways To Unlock SIM Cards With a Lost PUK Code</h2><p>Locking your SIM card with a forgotten PIN can be a frustrating experience, especially when your trusty PUK code seems to have vanished. While unauthorized methods exist to unlock your SIM card, venturing down that path can lead to complications and potential security risks.

But it doesn’t affect the Realme 12 5G device’s hardware identification, including the IMEI.</p><p>The IMEI is embedded into the hardware of the Realme 12 5G device. It is typically printed on the Realme 12 5G device’s packaging or can be found by dialing *#06# on the phone’s keypad.

As far as we know, it is legal in Africa and Asia, and illegal in Europe.</li><li>The IMEI number is hardcoded into your device. Therefore, changing your device’s IMEI number may void your device warranty and cause other issues such as network problems and software instability.</li><li>Legally, you have forfeited your ownership of your mobile device. When you purchase your device, the seller will jot down the original IMEI number on your receipt. So if you changed your IMEI and lost it, you may not be able to claim it. This is because authorities cannot see if it is truly yours.

This 4-digit code protects your phone number from unauthorized calls, texts, and data use. It’s essential to change the default PIN to one that’s both memorable for you and difficult for others to guess.</p><p>So, <strong>how to change the PIN on an Android phone</strong>’s SIM card? This article will provide a step-by-step guide to help you secure your data. But first, let’s explore why changing the default one is important.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/02/how-to-change-pin-on-android-phone-01.jpg"                      alt="a phone sim card"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-Why-Does-Changing-Your-SIM-PIN-Code-Matter-on-a-New-Phone"><a href="#Part-1-Why-Does-Changing-Your-SIM-PIN-Code-Matter-on-a-New-Phone" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Why Does Changing Your SIM PIN Code Matter on a New Phone?"></a>Part 1: Why Does Changing Your SIM PIN Code Matter on a New Phone?</h2><p>Your SIM PIN code acts as a password for your SIM card, which stores your phone number, contacts, and other essential data. Unlike the PIN you use to unlock your phone, the SIM PIN code is a separate layer of security. If someone tries to use your SIM card in another phone without the correct PIN, they won’t be able to access your network or data.</p><p>Here are more reasons why <strong>changing the PIN code of a SIM card</strong> is a smart move:</p><ul><li>Default PINs are easy to guess</li></ul><p>Most carriers use generic PINs like “1234” or “0000”. Change it to something unique and harder to crack.</p><ul><li>Protects data in case of loss or theft</li></ul><p>If you lose your phone or it gets stolen, a strong PIN code hinders the thief’s ability to make calls, send messages, or access your data stored on the SIM. It buys you time to report the loss and block your SIM card before they can do any damage.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/02/how-to-change-pin-on-android-phone-02.jpg"                      alt="sim card locked"                ></p><ul><li>Prevents accidental PIN lockouts</li></ul><p>Using a memorable PIN minimizes the risk of accidentally locking yourself out of your SIM card.</p><ul><li>Peace of mind</li></ul><p>It is crucial if you store sensitive info on your SIM or use your phone for work. Knowing about this extra safeguard is reassuring, ensuring your data stays protected.</p><p><strong>Remember:</strong></p><p>Choose a PIN code for your SIM that’s easy for you to remember but challenging for others to guess. Avoid using birthdays, anniversaries, or other easily identifiable information. By taking a few minutes to <strong>change the PIN code of the SIM card</strong>, you’ll gain a significant security advantage for your new phone and data.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-To-Change-Pin-on-Android-Phone-SIM-Cards"><a href="#Part-2-How-To-Change-Pin-on-Android-Phone-SIM-Cards" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How To Change Pin on Android Phone SIM Cards?"></a>Part 2: How To Change Pin on Android Phone SIM Cards?</h2><p>Keeping your SIM card secure is crucial for protecting your data and privacy. Thankfully, Android allows you to easily change your SIM card PIN to a more personal and memorable code. But before you begin:</p><ul><li>Contact your network carrier to get your PUK code if you already have it. You’ll need this if you enter the wrong PIN three times and lock your SIM card.</li><li>Remember the temporary default PIN: Most SIM cards have a default PIN, often 1234 or 0123. If you haven’t changed it, this is the PIN you’ll use initially.</li></ul><p><strong>Note:</strong></p><p>Entering the wrong PIN three times will lock your SIM card. You’ll need your network carrier’s PUK code to unlock it. Use it cautiously, as exceeding the maximum number of attempts will permanently block your SIM card. So, it’s best to memorize your PIN or store it securely to avoid relying on the PUK altogether.</p><p>Steps To Change Your SIM PIN</p><p>Here’s <strong>how to find and manage the SIM PIN code on Android</strong>:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Navigate to your phone’s <strong>Settings</strong> app. Next, look for the <strong>Security and privacy</strong> or <strong>Lock screen and security</strong> (or other similar option) depending on your device’s model.</li><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Scroll down and tap on <strong>More security settings</strong> or <strong>Other security settings</strong>.</li><li><strong>Step 3:</strong> Tap <strong>SIM card security</strong> or <strong>Set up SIM card lock</strong> (or something similar).</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/02/how-to-change-pin-on-android-phone-03.jpg"                      alt="sim card security in settings"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Step 4:</strong> If you have multiple SIMs, select the one you want to change the PIN code.</li><li><strong>Step 5:</strong> Tap <strong>Change SIM PIN</strong>.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/02/how-to-change-pin-on-android-phone-04.jpg"                      alt="change sim pin code on android"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Step 6:</strong> Input your current SIM card PIN code and tap <strong>OK</strong>.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/02/how-to-change-pin-on-android-phone-05.jpg"                      alt="enter old sim pin"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Step 7:</strong> Enter your desired new PIN code and tap <strong>OK</strong>.</li><li><strong>Step 8:</strong> Re-enter your new SIM card PIN code and tap <strong>OK</strong> to confirm.</li></ul><p>Success!

You cannot escape the carriers once you begin using a cell phone.</p><p>Customers can purchase a new handset via carriers or the mobile phone market. You may need an unlocked phone if you wish to use a different carrier’s service on your smartphone. However, if you want a gadget linked to a specific SIM card, you may buy one from the carriers for a reduced price.</p><h2 id="Part-1-What-Does-It-Mean-If-Your-Infinix-Note-30-VIP-Racing-Edition-Asks-for-SIM-Network-PIN"><a href="#Part-1-What-Does-It-Mean-If-Your-Infinix-Note-30-VIP-Racing-Edition-Asks-for-SIM-Network-PIN" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What Does It Mean If Your Infinix Note 30 VIP Racing Edition Asks for SIM Network PIN?"></a>Part 1: What Does It Mean If Your Infinix Note 30 VIP Racing Edition Asks for SIM Network PIN?</h2><p>When your phone prompts you to enter a SIM Network Unlock PIN, it means that your device is currently locked to a specific mobile network carrier, and it can only be used with SIM cards from that carrier. This locking mechanism is usually put in place by the carrier or the phone manufacturer to ensure that you continue to use their services, typically for the duration of a contract. As a result, your phone cannot be freely used with SIM cards from other carriers until it’s unlocked using the correct PIN or code.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/11/fix-network-locked-simcard-inserted-01.jpg"                      alt="sim locked"                ></p><h2 id="Part-2-Why-Does-Your-Infinix-Note-30-VIP-Racing-Edition-Say-Invalid-SIM-Card-–-Network-Locked-SIM-Card-Inserted"><a href="#Part-2-Why-Does-Your-Infinix-Note-30-VIP-Racing-Edition-Say-Invalid-SIM-Card-–-Network-Locked-SIM-Card-Inserted" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Why Does Your Infinix Note 30 VIP Racing Edition Say Invalid SIM Card – Network Locked SIM Card Inserted?"></a>Part 2: Why Does Your Infinix Note 30 VIP Racing Edition Say Invalid SIM Card – Network Locked SIM Card Inserted?</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/11/fix-network-locked-simcard-inserted-2.jpg"                      alt="remove network lock"                ></p><p><strong>System Errors</strong></p><p>Since SIM locking is a smartphone restriction implemented to stop it from being used on other networks, Android system errors can cause network-locked SIM cards. Resetting these errors can help unlock your <strong>network locked SIM card inserted</strong> device. Service providers decided to provide a formal SIM unlocking option as a result.</p><p>Because of this, any locked SIM may be readily unlocked, and once a device opens, it can work like a conventional mobile phone and with any SIM card of the user’s choosing.</p><p><strong>Carrier Lock</strong></p><p>The consumer must stick with the same service provider for a specific time after purchasing the bundled device and data pack. This is called a carrier lock on the Infinix Note 30 VIP Racing Edition device and is one of the most common errors in <strong>network locked SIM card inserted</strong> devices. During that time, the Infinix Note 30 VIP Racing Edition device will be network- or SIM-locked, prohibiting the user from changing service providers.</p><p>The user cannot change the SIM. The service provider will offer the SIM Unlock code needed to unlock the handset when the contract expires. The gadget can be used with any other SIM card and exported to another country without problems when the network lock has been removed.</p><p><strong>Region Lock</strong></p><p>Apple and AT&amp;T initially worked together to implement the SIM lock and the SIM locked devices. The original purpose was to force the user to continue using the same service provider in a specific area or time.</p><p>However, some telecom service providers sell the handsets with select data plans as bundled plans in collaboration with the Infinix Note 30 VIP Racing Edition device manufacturers. As a result, the handset will cost less than it would otherwise. Sometimes, these offers are particular to a specific region, called a carrier lock.</p><p><strong>Firmware Problems</strong></p><p>Sometimes, the Infinix Note 30 VIP Racing Edition device manufacturers release many versions of the same firmware for different geographical locations.</p><p>As a result, it may be possible that the user may face contradictions in the agreement of device firmware and the network-locked SIM card that was supposed to be used on the Infinix Note 30 VIP Racing Edition device. Due to firmware problems, the users may also face a network-locked SIM card-inserted device.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/11/fix-network-locked-simcard-inserted-03.png"                      alt="unlock sim card"                ></p><h2 id="Part-3-How-to-Unlock-Network-Locked-SIM-Card-Inserted"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-Unlock-Network-Locked-SIM-Card-Inserted" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How to Unlock Network Locked SIM Card Inserted?"></a>Part 3: How to Unlock Network Locked SIM Card Inserted?</h2><p>Unlocking a network-locked SIM card may seem like a complex task.

How to Unlock Network Locked Sim Card Inserted on iPhone?"></a>Bonus Tip. How to Unlock Network Locked Sim Card Inserted on iPhone?</h3><p>If you want a fast and easy method to unlock your network-locked iPhone, you can use a third-party tool such as Dr.Fone – Screen Unlock (iOS). It is the best sim-unlock tool for iPhone users. It enables users to safely unlock their devices within five minutes. With Dr.Fone, you don’t have to wait for the sim-unlock code or reset your device firmware that can remove all your data.</p><p>You can download Dr.Fone on your PC and use it to unlock your iPhone without data loss. You can also use Dr.Fone to unlock your iPhone’s screen lock and Apple ID. Although Dr.Fone is a one-stop solution for all of your phone-related problems, its sim-unlock only works for Apple devices. Here is how you unlock your carrier-locked iPhone with Dr.Fone – Screen Unlock (IOS).</p><ul><li>Download and install Dr.Fone on your PC. Launch the application and select the “Screen Unlock” tab from the list on the homepage.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/drfone-home.png"                      alt="homepage"                ></p><ul><li>Now, click on the “Remove SIM Locked” tab on the next page. You can only use it to unlock iPhones.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/remove-iphone-sim-1.png"                      alt="screen unlock page"                ></p><ul><li>Connect your iPhone and PC with a USB cable. Once your device is ready, click on the “Start” option to proceed with the sim unlock process.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/remove-iphone-sim-2.png"                      alt="remove sim locks"                ></p><ul><li>Next, the system will detect the Infinix Note 30 VIP Racing Edition device connection, then its information will show up on your PC screen. If all of it is OK, click on the “Unlock Now” option.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/remove-iphone-sim-3.png"                      alt="verify your device"                ></p><ul><li>You cannot unlock your iPhone without a jailbreak, so you must do it before the system unlocks it. You can learn about the jailbreak process via the guide, or watching the video provided by Dr.Fone to jailbreak your iPhone is also feasible. The process is compatible with devices running iOS 12 to iOS 14.8.1.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/remove-iphone-sim-4.png"                      alt="jailbreak instructions"                ></p><ul><li>Now, you have to complete three tasks on your iPhone. First, put the SIM card out of your device. Open “Settings” and tap on the “WIFI” option. Tap on the blue exclamation mark next to all the connected networks and select “Forget This Network.” Now, switch off the “WIFI” and insert the locked SIM card in your iPhone. Click on the “Continue” option on your computer.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/remove-iphone-sim-5.png"                      alt="insert sim card"                ></p><ul><li>After that, Dr.Fone will automatically start the SIM unlocking process. You can see its progress on your PC. The process only takes a few minutes to complete, so you don’t have to wait for a long time.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/remove-iphone-sim-6.png"                      alt="sim unlock progress"                ></p><ul><li>After the process ends, all the sim restrictions on your iOS device are now removed and you can use sim cards from any network carrier. Next, click on the “Done” option to end the sim unlocking process.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/remove-iphone-sim-7.png"                      alt="sim lock removed"                ></p><h2 id="Part-4-Why-is-SIM-Unlocking-Important"><a href="#Part-4-Why-is-SIM-Unlocking-Important" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: Why is SIM Unlocking Important?"></a>Part 4: Why is SIM Unlocking Important?</h2><p>As previously stated, a SIM lock enables a service provider to stop a customer from using the smartphone with the SIM cards of another service provider. This guarantees that the Infinix Note 30 VIP Racing Edition device is only being used with the original SIM card for each provider. This locking also has a lot of drawbacks because it is incompatible with any other SIM card.</p><ol><li>The phone cannot be used with other SIM cards if the SIM lock is enabled. Customers must therefore adhere to the current plan as is.</li><li>Since nobody wants to purchase a locked phone, it is hard for someone to sell or gift the mobile.</li><li>Traveling abroad with a SIM-locked phone could provide some challenges because you won’t be able to use a local SIM card on the phone while you’re there.</li></ol><p>All the problems can be fixed, and the SIM works in any nation with the removed SIM lock.</p><h3 id="Conclusion-1"><a href="#Conclusion-1" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h3><p>Any of the methods above can work to get around the prohibition against using other SIM cards with your Android handset. The best thing about using Dr.Fone-Screen Unlock is that you don’t need unlocking codes to complete the tasks.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins><br><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://fox-helps.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-the-ultimate-samsung-gear-360-camera-picks/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved The Ultimate Samsung Gear 360 Camera Picks</u></a></li><li><a href="https://desktop-recording.techidaily.com/updated-agriculture-pals-top-10-friendly-farm-games/"><u>[Updated] Agriculture Pals Top 10 Friendly Farm Games</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-cloud.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-elevate-the-experience-with-these-essential-flight-gears/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Elevate the Experience with These Essential Flight Gears</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-clips.techidaily.com/updated-integrating-social-networks-sharing-fb-videos-on-whatsapp/"><u>[Updated] Integrating Social Networks Sharing FB Videos on WhatsApp</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-blue.techidaily.com/in-2024-mastering-instagrams-podcast-post-and-story-distribution/"><u>In 2024, Mastering Instagram's Podcast Post & Story Distribution</u></a></li><li><a href="https://sim-unlock.techidaily.com/in-2024-the-best-android-sim-unlock-code-generators-unlock-your-tecno-pova-6-pro-5g-phone-hassle-free-by-drfone-android/"><u>In 2024, The Best Android SIM Unlock Code Generators Unlock Your Tecno Pova 6 Pro 5G Phone Hassle-Free</u></a></li><li><a href="https://sim-unlock.techidaily.com/in-2024-tutorial-to-change-honor-70-lite-5g-imei-without-root-a-comprehensive-guide-by-drfone-android/"><u>In 2024, Tutorial to Change Honor 70 Lite 5G IMEI without Root A Comprehensive Guide</u></a></li><li><a href="https://sim-unlock.techidaily.com/in-2024-what-does-enter-puk-code-mean-and-why-did-the-sim-get-puk-blocked-on-honor-play-40c-device-by-drfone-android/"><u>In 2024, What Does Enter PUK Code Mean And Why Did The Sim Get PUK Blocked On Honor Play 40C Device</u></a></li><li><a href="https://article-tips.techidaily.com/mastering-multimedia-meetings-fusing-zooms-potential-with-skype-for-2024/"><u>Mastering Multimedia Meetings Fusing Zoom's Potential with Skype for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-tips.techidaily.com/next-level-performance-meets-futuristic-elegance-in-dell-alienware-aurora-r9-game-rig/"><u>Next-Level Performance Meets Futuristic Elegance in Dell Alienware Aurora R9 Game Rig</u></a></li><li><a href="https://sim-unlock.techidaily.com/top-11-free-apps-to-check-imei-on-infinix-note-30-pro-phones-by-drfone-android/"><u>Top 11 Free Apps to Check IMEI on Infinix Note 30 Pro Phones</u></a></li><li><a href="https://sim-unlock.techidaily.com/top-imei-unlokers-for-your-honor-90-gt-phone-by-drfone-android/"><u>Top IMEI Unlokers for Your Honor 90 GT Phone</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

You loved the Honor Magic 5 Pro device but your network provider does not have any plans that exactly suit your needs. To release your device from your current network’s clutches, you will need to unlock your phone.</p><p>There are three ways you can do it and this post will go through each method so that you can find one that you are most comfortable with. Do note that if your contract has ended with your network provider, this “How to unlock Honor Magic 5 Pro” post can be skipped as you can just ask them to unlock your phone or purchase a <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/unlock/unlock-samsung-sim-network-unlock-pin.html" >sim network unlock pin <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> for a minimal price.</p><h2 id="Part-1-Honor-Magic-5-Pro-Unlock-Code"><a href="#Part-1-Honor-Magic-5-Pro-Unlock-Code" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Honor Magic 5 Pro Unlock Code"></a>Part 1: Honor Magic 5 Pro Unlock Code</h2><p>This is probably the easiest, no-fuss method to <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/unlock-android-screen/" >sim unlock <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> Honor Magic 5 Pro. Follow these steps carefully to successfully perform Honor Magic 5 Pro unlock code.</p><p>Do take note that this process may not work with your carrier. Therefore, always check if this is the right way to obtain the necessary code:</p><ul><li>1. Check the SIM lock status—you can do this by dialing <strong>*#*#7378423#*#*</strong>.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2016/08/14707989592943.jpg"                      alt="sony xperia unlock code"                ></p><ul><li>2. Tap <strong>Service info</strong> then <strong>Sim lock</strong>.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2016/08/14707989592897.jpg"                      alt="unlock with sony xperia unlock code"                ></p><ul><li>3. The number beside <strong>Network</strong> indicates how many attempts you have to unlock the phone. If it says ‘7’ it means you have seven attempts; ‘0’ simply means it is hard locked and cannot be unlocked using this method.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2016/08/14707989597664.jpg"                      alt="unlock code sony xperia"                ></p><ul><li>4. Find the <strong>IMEI number</strong> by dialing <strong>*#06#</strong>. Jot it down as this will be your code.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2016/08/14707998453087.jpg"                      alt="sony unlock code"                ></p><ul><li>5. Insert your new SIM card and tap in the IMEI number when it asks you for SIM network unlock PIN.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2016/08/unlock-screen.jpg"                      alt="sony unlock screen"                ></p><p>If you have followed these steps to a tee, you should have unlocked your device.

On the new window, fill in your phone IMEI number, model, your contact email, and other required information. Once your order is processed, the system will then send you the unlock code and instructions. You can follow the instruction to unlock your phone easily.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Honor-Magic-5-Pro-Unlock-Carrier"><a href="#Part-3-Honor-Magic-5-Pro-Unlock-Carrier" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Honor Magic 5 Pro Unlock Carrier"></a>Part 3: Honor Magic 5 Pro Unlock Carrier</h2><p>If your Honor Magic 5 Pro is hard locked, this is your best bet in getting your device unlocked. Actually, it is the safest method among all three:</p><ol><li>Get a new SIM card from a new carrier.</li><li>Call your carrier’s customer service line and ask what are the requirements to qualify you to get your Honor Magic 5 Pro unlocked. If you have honored your contract, there should not be any problems. However, do ask your carrier if there are any additional requirements. Do note that there may be fees involved.</li><li>Once your customer service representative has determined if you have met all their requirements, they should give you the SIM network unlock PIN Honor Magic 5 Pro. Again, depending on your carrier, they might either give you the code over the phone, through email or via SMS. If you have the choice, always opt for email or SMS so that you are able to jot down the right number.</li><li>Once you have gotten the code, insert the new SIM card (from your new carrier). You will receive a prompt to enter your code. Make sure that you key in the right code—entering the wrong code will cause your phone to be locked (possibly forever).</li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2016/08/unlock-screen.jpg"                      alt="sony unlock screen"                ></p><h2 id="Part-4-Honor-Magic-5-Pro-Unlock-App-Software"><a href="#Part-4-Honor-Magic-5-Pro-Unlock-App-Software" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: Honor Magic 5 Pro Unlock App&#x2F;Software"></a>Part 4: Honor Magic 5 Pro Unlock App&#x2F;Software</h2><p>There are some of us out there who are just not confident with doing things ourselves or trusting our own carrier.</p><p>HOWEVER, if your first instinct is to head to Google Play to look for SIM unlock tools, heed these cautions. There are currently many apps that claim that they can unlock your phone but it is just a scam. You should also avoid torrent files available online.

But your phone pops up with a request for a PIN code to unlock it. What’s that all about, and what do you enter? There are two main reasons why your phone might be asking for a SIM PIN or unlock code:</p><p>SIM Network Lock</p><p>The SIM Network Lock is a restriction placed by your phone’s original network provider, locking it to their network. It means you can only use the Honor Magic 5 Pro device with SIM cards from that specific carrier. Carriers use this to ensure that the phones they sell work only with their service. When you buy a subsidized phone, they want to ensure you stick around for the contract duration.</p><p>If you insert a SIM card from a different carrier, your phone will ask for a <strong>SIM Network Unlock PIN</strong> or Network Unlock Code (NUC). You’ll learn more about it in the upcoming sections of this article.</p><p>SIM Card Lock</p><p>SIM Card Lock is a security feature that protects your SIM card from unauthorized use on other devices. It requires you to enter a PIN (Personal Identification Number) to unlock the SIM card before you can use it.</p><p>The default PIN is usually printed on the back of the SIM card or its packaging. If you haven’t changed your PIN, use the 4-8 digit code provided by the carrier when you get your SIM card.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/02/sim-network-unlock-pin-02.jpg"                      alt="sim card lock pin"                ></p><p>If you’ve forgotten the <strong>SIM PIN code</strong>, you can use the PUK (PIN Unlock Key) code to unlock the SIM and set a new PIN. The PUK code is also printed on the SIM card packaging, but be careful, as entering the wrong PUK code too many times can permanently lock the SIM card.</p><p>Not knowing the <strong>SIM unlock PIN</strong> code can be frustrating, especially if you want to switch mobile carriers.

You loved the Realme 12+ 5G device but your network provider does not have any plans that exactly suit your needs. To release your device from your current network’s clutches, you will need to unlock your phone.</p><p>There are three ways you can do it and this post will go through each method so that you can find one that you are most comfortable with. Do note that if your contract has ended with your network provider, this “How to unlock Realme 12+ 5G” post can be skipped as you can just ask them to unlock your phone or purchase a <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/unlock/unlock-samsung-sim-network-unlock-pin.html" >sim network unlock pin <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> for a minimal price.</p><h2 id="Part-1-Realme-12-5G-Unlock-Code"><a href="#Part-1-Realme-12-5G-Unlock-Code" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Realme 12+ 5G Unlock Code"></a>Part 1: Realme 12+ 5G Unlock Code</h2><p>This is probably the easiest, no-fuss method to <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/unlock-android-screen/" >sim unlock <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> Realme 12+ 5G. Follow these steps carefully to successfully perform Realme 12+ 5G unlock code.</p><p>Do take note that this process may not work with your carrier. Therefore, always check if this is the right way to obtain the necessary code:</p><ul><li>1. Check the SIM lock status—you can do this by dialing <strong>*#*#7378423#*#*</strong>.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2016/08/14707989592943.jpg"                      alt="sony xperia unlock code"                ></p><ul><li>2. Tap <strong>Service info</strong> then <strong>Sim lock</strong>.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2016/08/14707989592897.jpg"                      alt="unlock with sony xperia unlock code"                ></p><ul><li>3. The number beside <strong>Network</strong> indicates how many attempts you have to unlock the phone. If it says ‘7’ it means you have seven attempts; ‘0’ simply means it is hard locked and cannot be unlocked using this method.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2016/08/14707989597664.jpg"                      alt="unlock code sony xperia"                ></p><ul><li>4. Find the <strong>IMEI number</strong> by dialing <strong>*#06#</strong>. Jot it down as this will be your code.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2016/08/14707998453087.jpg"                      alt="sony unlock code"                ></p><ul><li>5. Insert your new SIM card and tap in the IMEI number when it asks you for SIM network unlock PIN.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2016/08/unlock-screen.jpg"                      alt="sony unlock screen"                ></p><p>If you have followed these steps to a tee, you should have unlocked your device.

Visit Doctor - SIM Unlock Service official website, click on the Select Your Realme 12+ 5G button, and then select Realme among all the phone brands.</p><p>Step 2.

Actually, it is the safest method among all three:</p><ol><li>Get a new SIM card from a new carrier.</li><li>Call your carrier’s customer service line and ask what are the requirements to qualify you to get your Realme 12+ 5G unlocked. If you have honored your contract, there should not be any problems. However, do ask your carrier if there are any additional requirements. Do note that there may be fees involved.</li><li>Once your customer service representative has determined if you have met all their requirements, they should give you the SIM network unlock PIN Realme 12+ 5G. Again, depending on your carrier, they might either give you the code over the phone, through email or via SMS. If you have the choice, always opt for email or SMS so that you are able to jot down the right number.</li><li>Once you have gotten the code, insert the new SIM card (from your new carrier). You will receive a prompt to enter your code. Make sure that you key in the right code—entering the wrong code will cause your phone to be locked (possibly forever).</li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2016/08/unlock-screen.jpg"                      alt="sony unlock screen"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://bluettiit.sjv.io/c/5597632/2148127/17093" target="_top" id="2148127">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17093-2148127" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="120" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://bluettiit.sjv.io/i/5597632/2148127/17093"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-4-Realme-12-5G-Unlock-App-Software"><a href="#Part-4-Realme-12-5G-Unlock-App-Software" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: Realme 12+ 5G Unlock App&#x2F;Software"></a>Part 4: Realme 12+ 5G Unlock App&#x2F;Software</h2><p>There are some of us out there who are just not confident with doing things ourselves or trusting our own carrier.</p><p>HOWEVER, if your first instinct is to head to Google Play to look for SIM unlock tools, heed these cautions. There are currently many apps that claim that they can unlock your phone but it is just a scam. You should also avoid torrent files available online. These apps and software are usually laced with Trojans and other types of malware.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Three-Ways-to-Sim-Unlock-Honor-Magic-5"><a href="#Three-Ways-to-Sim-Unlock-Honor-Magic-5" class="headerlink" title="Three Ways to Sim Unlock Honor Magic 5"></a>Three Ways to Sim Unlock Honor Magic 5</h2><p>You probably purchased your Honor Magic 5 for a significant discount but are now stuck with the same network for a couple of years. You loved the Honor Magic 5 device but your network provider does not have any plans that exactly suit your needs. To release your device from your current network’s clutches, you will need to unlock your phone.</p><p>There are three ways you can do it and this post will go through each method so that you can find one that you are most comfortable with. Do note that if your contract has ended with your network provider, this “How to unlock Honor Magic 5” post can be skipped as you can just ask them to unlock your phone or purchase a <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/unlock/unlock-samsung-sim-network-unlock-pin.html" >sim network unlock pin <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> for a minimal price.</p><h2 id="Part-1-Honor-Magic-5-Unlock-Code"><a href="#Part-1-Honor-Magic-5-Unlock-Code" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Honor Magic 5 Unlock Code"></a>Part 1: Honor Magic 5 Unlock Code</h2><p>This is probably the easiest, no-fuss method to <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/unlock-android-screen/" >sim unlock <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> Honor Magic 5. Follow these steps carefully to successfully perform Honor Magic 5 unlock code.</p><p>Do take note that this process may not work with your carrier. Therefore, always check if this is the right way to obtain the necessary code:</p><ul><li>1. Check the SIM lock status—you can do this by dialing <strong>*#*#7378423#*#*</strong>.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2016/08/14707989592943.jpg"                      alt="sony xperia unlock code"                ></p><ul><li>2. Tap <strong>Service info</strong> then <strong>Sim lock</strong>.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2016/08/14707989592897.jpg"                      alt="unlock with sony xperia unlock code"                ></p><ul><li>3. The number beside <strong>Network</strong> indicates how many attempts you have to unlock the phone. If it says ‘7’ it means you have seven attempts; ‘0’ simply means it is hard locked and cannot be unlocked using this method.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2016/08/14707989597664.jpg"                      alt="unlock code sony xperia"                ></p><ul><li>4. Find the <strong>IMEI number</strong> by dialing <strong>*#06#</strong>. Jot it down as this will be your code.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2016/08/14707998453087.jpg"                      alt="sony unlock code"                ></p><ul><li>5. Insert your new SIM card and tap in the IMEI number when it asks you for SIM network unlock PIN.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2016/08/unlock-screen.jpg"                      alt="sony unlock screen"                ></p><p>If you have followed these steps to a tee, you should have unlocked your device. If you had to abort after Step 2, look at the other two methods below.</p><h2 id="Part-2-The-Best-Honor-Magic-5-SIM-Unlock-Code-Generator"><a href="#Part-2-The-Best-Honor-Magic-5-SIM-Unlock-Code-Generator" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: The Best Honor Magic 5 SIM Unlock Code Generator"></a>Part 2: The Best Honor Magic 5 SIM Unlock Code Generator</h2><p>To safely and successfully sim unlock your Honor Magic 5, it is important to find a trustworthy <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/unlock-android-screen/" >sim network unlock pin software <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. Here I am going you present to you DoctorSIM - SIM Unlock Service. It definitely is one of the best sim unlocking code generators in the market. It helps you permanently sim unlock your phone so you can use it on any carrier provider you want in the world.</p><h3 id="How-to-use-SIM-Unlock-Service"><a href="#How-to-use-SIM-Unlock-Service" class="headerlink" title="How to use SIM Unlock Service"></a>How to use SIM Unlock Service</h3><p>Step 1. Visit Doctor - SIM Unlock Service official website, click on the Select Your Honor Magic 5 button, and then select Honor among all the phone brands.</p><p>Step 2. On the new window, fill in your phone IMEI number, model, your contact email, and other required information. Once your order is processed, the system will then send you the unlock code and instructions. You can follow the instruction to unlock your phone easily.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Honor-Magic-5-Unlock-Carrier"><a href="#Part-3-Honor-Magic-5-Unlock-Carrier" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Honor Magic 5 Unlock Carrier"></a>Part 3: Honor Magic 5 Unlock Carrier</h2><p>If your Honor Magic 5 is hard locked, this is your best bet in getting your device unlocked. Actually, it is the safest method among all three:</p><ol><li>Get a new SIM card from a new carrier.</li><li>Call your carrier’s customer service line and ask what are the requirements to qualify you to get your Honor Magic 5 unlocked. If you have honored your contract, there should not be any problems. However, do ask your carrier if there are any additional requirements. Do note that there may be fees involved.</li><li>Once your customer service representative has determined if you have met all their requirements, they should give you the SIM network unlock PIN Honor Magic 5. Again, depending on your carrier, they might either give you the code over the phone, through email or via SMS. If you have the choice, always opt for email or SMS so that you are able to jot down the right number.</li><li>Once you have gotten the code, insert the new SIM card (from your new carrier). You will receive a prompt to enter your code. Make sure that you key in the right code—entering the wrong code will cause your phone to be locked (possibly forever).</li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2016/08/unlock-screen.jpg"                      alt="sony unlock screen"                ></p><h2 id="Part-4-Honor-Magic-5-Unlock-App-Software"><a href="#Part-4-Honor-Magic-5-Unlock-App-Software" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: Honor Magic 5 Unlock App&#x2F;Software"></a>Part 4: Honor Magic 5 Unlock App&#x2F;Software</h2><p>There are some of us out there who are just not confident with doing things ourselves or trusting our own carrier.</p><p>HOWEVER, if your first instinct is to head to Google Play to look for SIM unlock tools, heed these cautions. There are currently many apps that claim that they can unlock your phone but it is just a scam. You should also avoid torrent files available online. These apps and software are usually laced with Trojans and other types of malware. So do sort through the reviews so that you will not fall into a malicious trap.</p><p>One that we can attest to is  <strong><a class="link"   href="http://mymobileunlocking.com/" >MyMobileUnlocking.com <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong>; it is fast and affordable.

Therefore, if you travel frequently around the world, having an unlocked Honor Magic 5 would be beneficial. Using a local SIM card is much cheaper than paying for exorbitant roaming charges.</p><p>You can also benefit from an unlocked Honor Magic 5 if you are the kind of person who likes to take advantage of current offers provided by your local carriers. Prepaid plans are always changing in terms of offering so having the flexibility of changing carriers and prepaid plans can help you save money in the long run.</p><h2 id="Part-6-The-downside-of-an-unlocked-Honor-Magic-5"><a href="#Part-6-The-downside-of-an-unlocked-Honor-Magic-5" class="headerlink" title="Part 6: The downside of an unlocked Honor Magic 5"></a>Part 6: The downside of an unlocked Honor Magic 5</h2><p>Are you thinking “Well, why can’t I just buy an unlocked Honor Magic 5 in the first place?” right about now? Well, you can but think of the amount of money it will cost you.</p><p>For example, in Australia, an unlocked Honor Magic 5 will cost around $499 from any Honor outlet but $0 for the Honor Magic 5 device when you pair it with a 24-month postpaid plan. While this may look attractive now, you may be paying more for a locked Honor Magic 5 in the long run.</p><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>Now that you know the three ways of unlocking your Honor Magic 5, all you need to do is find one that is most compatible with you. Just remember to think of everything through and carefully.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Three-Ways-to-Sim-Unlock-Honor-Magic-5"><a href="#Three-Ways-to-Sim-Unlock-Honor-Magic-5" class="headerlink" title="Three Ways to Sim Unlock Honor Magic 5"></a>Three Ways to Sim Unlock Honor Magic 5</h2><p>You probably purchased your Honor Magic 5 for a significant discount but are now stuck with the same network for a couple of years. You loved the Honor Magic 5 device but your network provider does not have any plans that exactly suit your needs. To release your device from your current network’s clutches, you will need to unlock your phone.</p><p>There are three ways you can do it and this post will go through each method so that you can find one that you are most comfortable with. Do note that if your contract has ended with your network provider, this “How to unlock Honor Magic 5” post can be skipped as you can just ask them to unlock your phone or purchase a <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/unlock/unlock-samsung-sim-network-unlock-pin.html" >sim network unlock pin <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> for a minimal price.</p><h2 id="Part-1-Honor-Magic-5-Unlock-Code"><a href="#Part-1-Honor-Magic-5-Unlock-Code" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Honor Magic 5 Unlock Code"></a>Part 1: Honor Magic 5 Unlock Code</h2><p>This is probably the easiest, no-fuss method to <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/unlock-android-screen/" >sim unlock <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> Honor Magic 5. Follow these steps carefully to successfully perform Honor Magic 5 unlock code.</p><p>Do take note that this process may not work with your carrier. Therefore, always check if this is the right way to obtain the necessary code:</p><ul><li>1. Check the SIM lock status—you can do this by dialing <strong>*#*#7378423#*#*</strong>.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2016/08/14707989592943.jpg"                      alt="sony xperia unlock code"                ></p><ul><li>2. Tap <strong>Service info</strong> then <strong>Sim lock</strong>.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2016/08/14707989592897.jpg"                      alt="unlock with sony xperia unlock code"                ></p><ul><li>3. The number beside <strong>Network</strong> indicates how many attempts you have to unlock the phone. If it says ‘7’ it means you have seven attempts; ‘0’ simply means it is hard locked and cannot be unlocked using this method.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2016/08/14707989597664.jpg"                      alt="unlock code sony xperia"                ></p><ul><li>4. Find the <strong>IMEI number</strong> by dialing <strong>*#06#</strong>. Jot it down as this will be your code.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2016/08/14707998453087.jpg"                      alt="sony unlock code"                ></p><ul><li>5. Insert your new SIM card and tap in the IMEI number when it asks you for SIM network unlock PIN.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2016/08/unlock-screen.jpg"                      alt="sony unlock screen"                ></p><p>If you have followed these steps to a tee, you should have unlocked your device. If you had to abort after Step 2, look at the other two methods below.</p><h2 id="Part-2-The-Best-Honor-Magic-5-SIM-Unlock-Code-Generator"><a href="#Part-2-The-Best-Honor-Magic-5-SIM-Unlock-Code-Generator" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: The Best Honor Magic 5 SIM Unlock Code Generator"></a>Part 2: The Best Honor Magic 5 SIM Unlock Code Generator</h2><p>To safely and successfully sim unlock your Honor Magic 5, it is important to find a trustworthy <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/unlock-android-screen/" >sim network unlock pin software <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.

Visit Doctor - SIM Unlock Service official website, click on the Select Your Honor Magic 5 button, and then select Honor among all the phone brands.</p><p>Step 2. On the new window, fill in your phone IMEI number, model, your contact email, and other required information. Once your order is processed, the system will then send you the unlock code and instructions. You can follow the instruction to unlock your phone easily.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Honor-Magic-5-Unlock-Carrier"><a href="#Part-3-Honor-Magic-5-Unlock-Carrier" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Honor Magic 5 Unlock Carrier"></a>Part 3: Honor Magic 5 Unlock Carrier</h2><p>If your Honor Magic 5 is hard locked, this is your best bet in getting your device unlocked. Actually, it is the safest method among all three:</p><ol><li>Get a new SIM card from a new carrier.</li><li>Call your carrier’s customer service line and ask what are the requirements to qualify you to get your Honor Magic 5 unlocked. If you have honored your contract, there should not be any problems. However, do ask your carrier if there are any additional requirements. Do note that there may be fees involved.</li><li>Once your customer service representative has determined if you have met all their requirements, they should give you the SIM network unlock PIN Honor Magic 5. Again, depending on your carrier, they might either give you the code over the phone, through email or via SMS. If you have the choice, always opt for email or SMS so that you are able to jot down the right number.</li><li>Once you have gotten the code, insert the new SIM card (from your new carrier). You will receive a prompt to enter your code. Make sure that you key in the right code—entering the wrong code will cause your phone to be locked (possibly forever).</li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2016/08/unlock-screen.jpg"                      alt="sony unlock screen"                ></p><h2 id="Part-4-Honor-Magic-5-Unlock-App-Software"><a href="#Part-4-Honor-Magic-5-Unlock-App-Software" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: Honor Magic 5 Unlock App&#x2F;Software"></a>Part 4: Honor Magic 5 Unlock App&#x2F;Software</h2><p>There are some of us out there who are just not confident with doing things ourselves or trusting our own carrier.</p><p>HOWEVER, if your first instinct is to head to Google Play to look for SIM unlock tools, heed these cautions. There are currently many apps that claim that they can unlock your phone but it is just a scam. You should also avoid torrent files available online. These apps and software are usually laced with Trojans and other types of malware. So do sort through the reviews so that you will not fall into a malicious trap.</p><p>One that we can attest to is  <strong><a class="link"   href="http://mymobileunlocking.com/" >MyMobileUnlocking.com <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong>; it is fast and affordable.

Therefore, if you travel frequently around the world, having an unlocked Honor Magic 5 would be beneficial. Using a local SIM card is much cheaper than paying for exorbitant roaming charges.</p><p>You can also benefit from an unlocked Honor Magic 5 if you are the kind of person who likes to take advantage of current offers provided by your local carriers. Prepaid plans are always changing in terms of offering so having the flexibility of changing carriers and prepaid plans can help you save money in the long run.</p><h2 id="Part-6-The-downside-of-an-unlocked-Honor-Magic-5"><a href="#Part-6-The-downside-of-an-unlocked-Honor-Magic-5" class="headerlink" title="Part 6: The downside of an unlocked Honor Magic 5"></a>Part 6: The downside of an unlocked Honor Magic 5</h2><p>Are you thinking “Well, why can’t I just buy an unlocked Honor Magic 5 in the first place?” right about now? Well, you can but think of the amount of money it will cost you.</p><p>For example, in Australia, an unlocked Honor Magic 5 will cost around $499 from any Honor outlet but $0 for the Honor Magic 5 device when you pair it with a 24-month postpaid plan. While this may look attractive now, you may be paying more for a locked Honor Magic 5 in the long run.</p><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>Now that you know the three ways of unlocking your Honor Magic 5, all you need to do is find one that is most compatible with you. Just remember to think of everything through and carefully. Most importantly, if you have a locked device, always seek advice from your carrier to see if this is possible.</p><h2 id="Easily-Unlock-Your-Honor-Magic-5-Device-SIM"><a href="#Easily-Unlock-Your-Honor-Magic-5-Device-SIM" class="headerlink" title="Easily Unlock Your Honor Magic 5 Device SIM"></a>Easily Unlock Your Honor Magic 5 Device SIM</h2><p>Is your Android phone SIM locked?

You can find out if yours is by checking the Honor Magic 5 device’s documentation. If you see the words “unlocked” on the initial receipt then you know that the Honor Magic 5 device is not SIM locked.</p><p>Another easy way to find out is to ask your carrier if the Honor Magic 5 device is locked on to their network.

If it doesn’t work, you will know that the Honor Magic 5 device is SIM locked.</p><p>If you bought your device from a third party re-seller such as Amazon you are more likely to be in possession of an unlocked device.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-SIM-Unlock-your-Android-Device"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-SIM-Unlock-your-Android-Device" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to SIM Unlock your Android Device"></a>Part 2: How to SIM Unlock your Android Device</h2><p>If you find that your SIM is locked, here’s a few things you can do to unlock the Honor Magic 5 device.</p><p>Avoid all of the apps on the Google Play Store that promise to unlock your device, most of them don’t work and may even harbour a lot of Trojans and malware that will cause further problems for you and your device.</p><p>There are safe and very legal ways to unlock your device. Just try one of the following.</p><p><strong><em>Ask your Carrier to Unlock your Device</em></strong></p><p>This is the best option when you want to safely unlock your device. By February 2015, American cell phone owners got the option to request their carriers to unlock their device for them. Before that the law didn’t allow for carriers to unlock SIM cards in the United States. This unpopular law was reversed following a similar move by the European Union in 2013.

This will save you from long-term hassle as you will have the freedom to switch carriers and SIM cards whenever you like. On the other hand, if we talk about locked phones, they’re expensive and a headache to deal with because of the requirements and problems they come with.</p><p>If you’re concerned about a dual-SIM phone, then you can have one SIM pinned to a good quality carrier. The other SIM can be temporary and cheap. This is an amazing option for you if you’re traveling, as you’ll have the flexibility to change carriers for the temporary SIM no matter wherever you are.</p><h2 id="Conclusion-1"><a href="#Conclusion-1" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>As a crux, an unlocked phone is a better choice than a locked phone. We would personally advise you to go for unlocked phones as this will save your time and money. You will have much more freedom and flexibility for changing between SIM and SIM carriers. Whereas on the locked phones, you will be bound to one SIM.

But your phone pops up with a request for a PIN code to unlock it. What’s that all about, and what do you enter? There are two main reasons why your phone might be asking for a SIM PIN or unlock code:</p><p>SIM Network Lock</p><p>The SIM Network Lock is a restriction placed by your phone’s original network provider, locking it to their network. It means you can only use the Xiaomi Redmi K70E device with SIM cards from that specific carrier. Carriers use this to ensure that the phones they sell work only with their service. When you buy a subsidized phone, they want to ensure you stick around for the contract duration.</p><p>If you insert a SIM card from a different carrier, your phone will ask for a <strong>SIM Network Unlock PIN</strong> or Network Unlock Code (NUC). You’ll learn more about it in the upcoming sections of this article.</p><p>SIM Card Lock</p><p>SIM Card Lock is a security feature that protects your SIM card from unauthorized use on other devices. It requires you to enter a PIN (Personal Identification Number) to unlock the SIM card before you can use it.</p><p>The default PIN is usually printed on the back of the SIM card or its packaging. If you haven’t changed your PIN, use the 4-8 digit code provided by the carrier when you get your SIM card.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/02/sim-network-unlock-pin-02.jpg"                      alt="sim card lock pin"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2135401/19272" target="_top" id="2135401">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2135401" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="320" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2135401/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>If you’ve forgotten the <strong>SIM PIN code</strong>, you can use the PUK (PIN Unlock Key) code to unlock the SIM and set a new PIN. The PUK code is also printed on the SIM card packaging, but be careful, as entering the wrong PUK code too many times can permanently lock the SIM card.</p><p>Not knowing the <strong>SIM unlock PIN</strong> code can be frustrating, especially if you want to switch mobile carriers.

It is also known as Network Unlock PIN (NUP), Network Control Key (NCK), or Network Unlock Code (NUC).</p><p>Unlocking your device can be useful if you:</p><ul><li>Bought a phone locked to a specific carrier and want to switch to a different one.</li><li>Are planning a trip abroad and want to use a local SIM card instead.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/02/sim-network-unlock-pin-04.jpg"                      alt="international travel illustration"                ></p><ul><li>Still haven’t finished your contract with your original carrier and want to keep the phone but use a different service.</li><li>Bought a phone second-hand locked to the previous owner’s network.</li><li>Want to increase your phone’s resale value; unlocked phones generally have a higher resale value than locked phones, as various buyers can use them.</li><li>Want more carrier flexibility; you are not tied to one carrier and can choose the provider that best suits your needs in terms of price, coverage, data plans, and other features.</li></ul><p>Things To Consider</p><p>Before you proceed, here are some key points to remember:</p><ul><li>Eligibility: Not all phones are eligible for network unlocking. Check with your carrier or manufacturer for details.</li><li>Costs: While some carriers can give <strong>SIM network unlock PIN for free</strong>, others may charge a fee. Third-party unlocking services also typically charge a fee.</li><li>Waiting time: It can take days or even weeks to receive your <strong>SIM unlock PIN</strong>code from your carrier and process it. For instance, Vodafone usually unlocks the Xiaomi Redmi K70E device within 72 hours to 10 days if they have to reach the manufacturer.</li><li>Risks: Using an unauthorized unlocking method could damage your phone or void its warranty.</li><li>Backup: Before unlocking your phone, back up your data, as the process may erase it.</li></ul><p>Now that you understand <strong>SIM Network Unlock PIN</strong>, let’s get down to business!

Get Your Realme Narzo 60 Pro 5G Phone Network-Ready</h2><p>A network-locked device tethers you to one carrier, limiting your choices. You might miss out on better deals, struggle with roaming charges abroad, or feel inconvenienced by limited coverage. And you can’t avoid these things without the right <strong>SIM network unlock PIN</strong>.</p><p>That’s why we’ve created this comprehensive guide to help you unlock your phone’s potential. This article will explain what a <strong>SIM network unlock PIN</strong> is, the process involved, and answer any questions you might have. Keep scrolling to learn more.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/02/sim-network-unlock-pin-01.jpg"                      alt="enter sim network unlock pin"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-Why-Is-Your-Realme-Narzo-60-Pro-5G-Asking-for-a-SIM-Network-Unlock-PIN"><a href="#Part-1-Why-Is-Your-Realme-Narzo-60-Pro-5G-Asking-for-a-SIM-Network-Unlock-PIN" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Why Is Your Realme Narzo 60 Pro 5G Asking for a SIM Network Unlock PIN?"></a>Part 1: Why Is Your Realme Narzo 60 Pro 5G Asking for a SIM Network Unlock PIN?</h2><p>You just bought a new phone, excited to use it with a new SIM card. But your phone pops up with a request for a PIN code to unlock it. What’s that all about, and what do you enter? There are two main reasons why your phone might be asking for a SIM PIN or unlock code:</p><p>SIM Network Lock</p><p>The SIM Network Lock is a restriction placed by your phone’s original network provider, locking it to their network. It means you can only use the Realme Narzo 60 Pro 5G device with SIM cards from that specific carrier. Carriers use this to ensure that the phones they sell work only with their service. When you buy a subsidized phone, they want to ensure you stick around for the contract duration.</p><p>If you insert a SIM card from a different carrier, your phone will ask for a <strong>SIM Network Unlock PIN</strong> or Network Unlock Code (NUC). You’ll learn more about it in the upcoming sections of this article.</p><p>SIM Card Lock</p><p>SIM Card Lock is a security feature that protects your SIM card from unauthorized use on other devices. It requires you to enter a PIN (Personal Identification Number) to unlock the SIM card before you can use it.</p><p>The default PIN is usually printed on the back of the SIM card or its packaging. If you haven’t changed your PIN, use the 4-8 digit code provided by the carrier when you get your SIM card.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/02/sim-network-unlock-pin-02.jpg"                      alt="sim card lock pin"                ></p><p>If you’ve forgotten the <strong>SIM PIN code</strong>, you can use the PUK (PIN Unlock Key) code to unlock the SIM and set a new PIN. The PUK code is also printed on the SIM card packaging, but be careful, as entering the wrong PUK code too many times can permanently lock the SIM card.</p><p>Not knowing the <strong>SIM unlock PIN</strong> code can be frustrating, especially if you want to switch mobile carriers. So, in the next part, we’ll explore whether it’s possible to unlock a SIM network-locked iPhone device.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2006933/19272" target="_top" id="2006933">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2006933" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2006933/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-2-Can-a-SIM-Network-Locked-iPhone-Be-Unlocked"><a href="#Part-2-Can-a-SIM-Network-Locked-iPhone-Be-Unlocked" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Can a SIM Network Locked iPhone Be Unlocked?"></a>Part 2: Can a SIM Network Locked iPhone Be Unlocked?</h2><p>Yes, a SIM network-locked iPhone can be unlocked by your network provider.
