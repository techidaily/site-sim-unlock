Therefore, if you travel frequently around the world, having an unlocked Tecno Camon 30 Pro 5G would be beneficial. Using a local SIM card is much cheaper than paying for exorbitant roaming charges.</p><p>You can also benefit from an unlocked Tecno Camon 30 Pro 5G if you are the kind of person who likes to take advantage of current offers provided by your local carriers. Prepaid plans are always changing in terms of offering so having the flexibility of changing carriers and prepaid plans can help you save money in the long run.</p><h2 id="Part-6-The-downside-of-an-unlocked-Tecno-Camon-30-Pro-5G"><a href="#Part-6-The-downside-of-an-unlocked-Tecno-Camon-30-Pro-5G" class="headerlink" title="Part 6: The downside of an unlocked Tecno Camon 30 Pro 5G"></a>Part 6: The downside of an unlocked Tecno Camon 30 Pro 5G</h2><p>Are you thinking “Well, why can’t I just buy an unlocked Tecno Camon 30 Pro 5G in the first place?” right about now? Well, you can but think of the amount of money it will cost you.</p><p>For example, in Australia, an unlocked Tecno Camon 30 Pro 5G will cost around $499 from any Tecno outlet but $0 for the Tecno Camon 30 Pro 5G device when you pair it with a 24-month postpaid plan. While this may look attractive now, you may be paying more for a locked Tecno Camon 30 Pro 5G in the long run.</p><h2 id="Conclusion-1"><a href="#Conclusion-1" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>Now that you know the three ways of unlocking your Tecno Camon 30 Pro 5G, all you need to do is find one that is most compatible with you. Just remember to think of everything through and carefully. Most importantly, if you have a locked device, always seek advice from your carrier to see if this is possible.</p><h2 id="Easily-Unlock-Your-Tecno-Camon-30-Pro-5G-Device-SIM"><a href="#Easily-Unlock-Your-Tecno-Camon-30-Pro-5G-Device-SIM" class="headerlink" title="Easily Unlock Your Tecno Camon 30 Pro 5G Device SIM"></a>Easily Unlock Your Tecno Camon 30 Pro 5G Device SIM</h2><p>Is your Android phone SIM locked? Having an unlocked device can have its benefits but most of the time most people don’t even know whether their device is SIM locked or not. In this article we are going to address this issue.

You can find out if yours is by checking the Tecno Camon 30 Pro 5G device’s documentation. If you see the words “unlocked” on the initial receipt then you know that the Tecno Camon 30 Pro 5G device is not SIM locked.</p><p>Another easy way to find out is to ask your carrier if the Tecno Camon 30 Pro 5G device is locked on to their network. You can also just try inserting another carrier’s SIM into your device. If it doesn’t work, you will know that the Tecno Camon 30 Pro 5G device is SIM locked.</p><p>If you bought your device from a third party re-seller such as Amazon you are more likely to be in possession of an unlocked device.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1982508">                    <video width="576" height="240" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1982508.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/22993-1982508">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1982508.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:360px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Fhomestyler.sjv.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1982508%2F22993'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1982508/22993"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-SIM-Unlock-your-Android-Device"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-SIM-Unlock-your-Android-Device" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to SIM Unlock your Android Device"></a>Part 2: How to SIM Unlock your Android Device</h2><p>If you find that your SIM is locked, here’s a few things you can do to unlock the Tecno Camon 30 Pro 5G device.</p><p>Avoid all of the apps on the Google Play Store that promise to unlock your device, most of them don’t work and may even harbour a lot of Trojans and malware that will cause further problems for you and your device.</p><p>There are safe and very legal ways to unlock your device. Just try one of the following.</p><p><strong><em>Ask your Carrier to Unlock your Device</em></strong></p><p>This is the best option when you want to safely unlock your device. By February 2015, American cell phone owners got the option to request their carriers to unlock their device for them. Before that the law didn’t allow for carriers to unlock SIM cards in the United States. This unpopular law was reversed following a similar move by the European Union in 2013. The same law also requires that the carriers inform customers every month whether their device is eligible for unlocking.</p><p>If your device is eligible for unlocking, all you need to do is contact the carrier provide and request for the <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/unlock/unlock-samsung-sim-network-unlock-pin.html" >sim network unlock pin <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. But if your Smartphone was bought on a contract, you may need to pay a termination fee to break the contract of you want to unlock the Tecno Camon 30 Pro 5G device before the contact term expires. For Smartphones that are not on contract, you have to wait 12 months from the date of purchase and ensure that your bill is paid before the carrier can give you the unlock code.</p><p><strong><em>How to Unlock your Android Phone</em></strong></p><p>To begin with, you need to confirm your IMEI number. Dial *#06# on your device and the IMEI number will appear on the screen. Copy this number to a secure location or wrote it down somewhere.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2016/06/14670084741192.jpg"                      alt="How to Unlock your Android Phone"                ></p><p>The next step is to find a reputable service that will unlock your Android device for you. This is action you should take only if you are absolutely desperate and your carrier can’t unlock your device for you. This is because many of these sites are unregulated and many of them are not reliable.</p><p>You should also know that many of them will charge a certain amount for your service. You can try <a class="link"   href="https://www.safeunlockcode.com/" >https://www.safeunlockcode.com/ <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> which is one of the more reputable ones we have found.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2016/06/14670084936436.jpg"                      alt="android SIM unlock-safeunlockcode"                ></p><p>You will need to enter the IMEI number as part of the information you need to provide before they can unlock your device.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Troubleshooting-Android-SIM-Unlock"><a href="#Part-3-Troubleshooting-Android-SIM-Unlock" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Troubleshooting Android SIM Unlock"></a>Part 3: Troubleshooting Android SIM Unlock</h2><p>There are lots of issues you may face when you try to unlock your device. The following are just some of the troubleshooting actions you can take if you encounter these problems.</p><p><strong><em>Unlocking Code Fails to work</em></strong></p><p>If you asked your carrier to unlock your device for you, chances are that they sent you a code. If the unlocking code fails to work double check that the IMEI number you used is the correct one and ensure that you purchased that device from that carrier and then try again.</p><p><strong><em>Samsung Device Freezes during unlocking</em></strong></p><p>If your device freezes during the unlocking process it typically means that you entered wrong unlocking code too many times. In this case you need to contact the carrier for a Master Code.</p><p><strong><em>My LG device won’t unlock</em></strong></p><p>There are some LG models that cannot be unlocked. These models include LG U300, LG U310, LG U8180, LG U8330, LG U8120, LG U8360, LG U8380, LGU880, and LG U890. If your device is one of these it can’t be unlocked by your carrier. You may need to look into other ways of unlocking your device.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins><br><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://desktop-recording.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-screen-grab-analysis-a-comparative-look-at-leading-software/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved Screen Grab Analysis A Comparative Look at Leading Software</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-knowledge.techidaily.com/2024-approved-impart-rotational-luminosity-modification-in-photoshopping/"><u>2024 Approved Impart Rotational Luminosity Modification in Photoshopping</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-recording.techidaily.com/2024-approved-the-experts-guide-to-recording-live-streaming-on-diverse-tech-gadgets/"><u>2024 Approved The Expert's Guide to Recording Live Streaming on Diverse Tech Gadgets</u></a></li><li><a href="https://win-forum.techidaily.com/connecting-across-platforms-mastering-facebook-twitter-instagram-and-youtube-for-enhanced-engagement/"><u>Connecting Across Platforms: Mastering Facebook, Twitter, Instagram & YouTube for Enhanced Engagement</u></a></li><li><a href="https://win-howtos.techidaily.com/free-online-converter-transform-mp3-files-into-3gp-format-with-movavi/"><u>Free Online Converter - Transform MP3 Files Into 3GP Format with Movavi</u></a></li><li><a href="https://sim-unlock.techidaily.com/how-to-factory-unlock-your-telstra-iphone-11-by-drfone-ios/"><u>How To Factory Unlock Your Telstra iPhone 11</u></a></li><li><a href="https://sim-unlock.techidaily.com/in-2024-android-unlock-code-sim-unlock-your-samsung-galaxy-s23-fe-phone-and-remove-locked-screen-by-drfone-android/"><u>In 2024, Android Unlock Code Sim Unlock Your Samsung Galaxy S23 FE Phone and Remove Locked Screen</u></a></li><li><a href="https://sim-unlock.techidaily.com/in-2024-android-unlock-code-sim-unlock-your-xiaomi-redmi-13c-5g-phone-and-remove-locked-screen-by-drfone-android/"><u>In 2024, Android Unlock Code Sim Unlock Your Xiaomi Redmi 13C 5G Phone and Remove Locked Screen</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-blue.techidaily.com/in-2024-blending-and-bonding-creating-unique-image-collages/"><u>In 2024, Blending and Bonding Creating Unique Image Collages</u></a></li><li><a href="https://sim-unlock.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-to-unlock-sim-card-on-samsung-galaxy-m14-5g-online-without-jailbreak-by-drfone-android/"><u>In 2024, How to Unlock SIM Card on Samsung Galaxy M14 5G online without jailbreak</u></a></li><li><a href="https://sim-unlock.techidaily.com/in-2024-top-10-samsung-galaxy-a34-5g-android-sim-unlock-apk-by-drfone-android/"><u>In 2024, Top 10 Samsung Galaxy A34 5G Android SIM Unlock APK</u></a></li><li><a href="https://sim-unlock.techidaily.com/in-2024-unlock-your-boost-mobile-apple-iphone-11-before-the-plan-expires-by-drfone-ios/"><u>In 2024, Unlock Your Boost Mobile Apple iPhone 11 Before the Plan Expires</u></a></li><li><a href="https://sim-unlock.techidaily.com/in-2024-ways-to-find-unlocking-codes-for-huawei-nova-y71-phones-by-drfone-android/"><u>In 2024, Ways To Find Unlocking Codes For Huawei Nova Y71 Phones</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-zero.techidaily.com/eginners-roadmap-to-a-thriving-youtube-channel-for-2024/"><u>The Beginner's Roadmap to a Thriving YouTube Channel for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-guidance.techidaily.com/top-10-no-cost-dvd-duplication-programs-how-to-copy-dvds-without-paying-a-penny/"><u>Top 10 No-Cost DVD Duplication Programs: How to Copy DVDs Without Paying a Penny</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ai-video.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-how-to-use-korean-to-english-video-translators-for-creators/"><u>Updated 2024 Approved How To Use Korean to English Video Translators for Creators</u></a></li><li><a href="https://sim-unlock.techidaily.com/what-does-enter-puk-code-mean-and-why-did-the-sim-get-puk-blocked-on-asus-rog-phone-8-pro-device-by-drfone-android/"><u>What Does Enter PUK Code Mean And Why Did The Sim Get PUK Blocked On Asus ROG Phone 8 Pro Device</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

And you can’t avoid these things without the right <strong>SIM network unlock PIN</strong>.</p><p>That’s why we’ve created this comprehensive guide to help you unlock your phone’s potential.

But your phone pops up with a request for a PIN code to unlock it. What’s that all about, and what do you enter? There are two main reasons why your phone might be asking for a SIM PIN or unlock code:</p><p>SIM Network Lock</p><p>The SIM Network Lock is a restriction placed by your phone’s original network provider, locking it to their network. It means you can only use the Poco X5 device with SIM cards from that specific carrier. Carriers use this to ensure that the phones they sell work only with their service. When you buy a subsidized phone, they want to ensure you stick around for the contract duration.</p><p>If you insert a SIM card from a different carrier, your phone will ask for a <strong>SIM Network Unlock PIN</strong> or Network Unlock Code (NUC). You’ll learn more about it in the upcoming sections of this article.</p><p>SIM Card Lock</p><p>SIM Card Lock is a security feature that protects your SIM card from unauthorized use on other devices. It requires you to enter a PIN (Personal Identification Number) to unlock the SIM card before you can use it.</p><p>The default PIN is usually printed on the back of the SIM card or its packaging. If you haven’t changed your PIN, use the 4-8 digit code provided by the carrier when you get your SIM card.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/02/sim-network-unlock-pin-02.jpg"                      alt="sim card lock pin"                ></p><p>If you’ve forgotten the <strong>SIM PIN code</strong>, you can use the PUK (PIN Unlock Key) code to unlock the SIM and set a new PIN. The PUK code is also printed on the SIM card packaging, but be careful, as entering the wrong PUK code too many times can permanently lock the SIM card.</p><p>Not knowing the <strong>SIM unlock PIN</strong> code can be frustrating, especially if you want to switch mobile carriers. So, in the next part, we’ll explore whether it’s possible to unlock a SIM network-locked iPhone device.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Can-a-SIM-Network-Locked-iPhone-Be-Unlocked"><a href="#Part-2-Can-a-SIM-Network-Locked-iPhone-Be-Unlocked" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Can a SIM Network Locked iPhone Be Unlocked?"></a>Part 2: Can a SIM Network Locked iPhone Be Unlocked?</h2><p>Yes, a SIM network-locked iPhone can be unlocked by your network provider. Insert a new SIM card, and you’ll be prompted to enter the <strong>SIM Network Unlock PIN</strong>. After inputting the correct unlock code, your iPhone is ready to use with any carrier.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/02/sim-network-unlock-pin-03.jpg"                      alt="sim not valid message on iphone"                ></p><p>If you are thinking about unlocking your iPhone, it’s crucial to grasp what a <strong>SIM Network Unlock PIN</strong> is and how it functions.</p><h2 id="Part-3-What-Is-a-SIM-Network-Unlock-PIN"><a href="#Part-3-What-Is-a-SIM-Network-Unlock-PIN" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: What Is a SIM Network Unlock PIN?"></a>Part 3: What Is a SIM Network Unlock PIN?</h2><p>A <strong>SIM network unlock PIN</strong> is a code allowing you to remove your phone’s network lock. It means you can use your phone with a SIM card from any compatible network provider, not just the one you originally bought it from. It is also known as Network Unlock PIN (NUP), Network Control Key (NCK), or Network Unlock Code (NUC).</p><p>Unlocking your device can be useful if you:</p><ul><li>Bought a phone locked to a specific carrier and want to switch to a different one.</li><li>Are planning a trip abroad and want to use a local SIM card instead.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/02/sim-network-unlock-pin-04.jpg"                      alt="international travel illustration"                ></p><ul><li>Still haven’t finished your contract with your original carrier and want to keep the phone but use a different service.</li><li>Bought a phone second-hand locked to the previous owner’s network.</li><li>Want to increase your phone’s resale value; unlocked phones generally have a higher resale value than locked phones, as various buyers can use them.</li><li>Want more carrier flexibility; you are not tied to one carrier and can choose the provider that best suits your needs in terms of price, coverage, data plans, and other features.</li></ul><p>Things To Consider</p><p>Before you proceed, here are some key points to remember:</p><ul><li>Eligibility: Not all phones are eligible for network unlocking. Check with your carrier or manufacturer for details.</li><li>Costs: While some carriers can give <strong>SIM network unlock PIN for free</strong>, others may charge a fee. Third-party unlocking services also typically charge a fee.</li><li>Waiting time: It can take days or even weeks to receive your <strong>SIM unlock PIN</strong>code from your carrier and process it. For instance, Vodafone usually unlocks the Poco X5 device within 72 hours to 10 days if they have to reach the manufacturer.</li><li>Risks: Using an unauthorized unlocking method could damage your phone or void its warranty.</li><li>Backup: Before unlocking your phone, back up your data, as the process may erase it.</li></ul><p>Now that you understand <strong>SIM Network Unlock PIN</strong>, let’s get down to business!

But that’s not really true. There are few ways that could help alleviate this problem or which could come as a help in such circumstances when the Smartphone is carrier locked. This problem often requires help from the carrier or network and can be easily sorted on doing so.</p><p>Now, having talked about SIM lock or carrier lock, it is also important to know whether a device is SIM locked or not, because not all phones are SIM locked. So, to find out whether your phone is network locked, you can check the documentation of the Realme GT 5 Pro device that you received while purchasing. If the phone is unlocked, the “unlocked word would certainly appear on the receipt. To be sure and precise whether the phone is SIM locked, the best thing that can be done is to contact the carrier and check if the phone is carrier locked. Before that, you can even check the phone yourself by placing a different SIM in the phone and check whether it works. If the same issue persists even with different SIMs, then there is a good chance that the phone is carrier locked. Now that we know how to check if the phone is SIM locked, it is imperative to know how to unlock Android phone for different carrier. It is not that difficult a task to unlock carrier locked phones and there are a few methods to unlock such locked phones.</p><h2 id="Part-1-Asking-the-Carrier-to-Unlock"><a href="#Part-1-Asking-the-Carrier-to-Unlock" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Asking the Carrier to Unlock"></a>Part 1: Asking the Carrier to Unlock</h2><p>One of the best options is getting in touch with the carrier and asking them to unlock the SIM locked phone. For that to happen, it is important to first know whether the phone is SIM locked and then whether the phone can be unlocked and if you are eligible to unlock the phone. There is an eligibility clause in contract for Smartphones bought on contract and if a specific time period is not up yet, then a termination fee is required to be paid by the user to break the contract in order to be able to use any SIM on the Realme GT 5 Pro device after getting the unlock code.</p><p><strong><em>Pros</em></strong></p><p>• This is the best way to unlock carrier locked devices.</p><p>• This is legal and everything happens based on the clause mentioned in the contract.</p><p><strong>_Cons<br>_</strong></p><p>• Sometimes, even the network providers or carrier refuse to unlock Smartphone</p><p>• There is a certain time period which if not over yet, unlocking the phone would require termination fee.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Professional-Reputable-Smartphone-Unlock-Service"><a href="#Part-2-Professional-Reputable-Smartphone-Unlock-Service" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Professional Reputable Smartphone Unlock Service"></a>Part 2: Professional Reputable Smartphone Unlock Service</h2><p>If you have tried out contacting the carrier and there is no way the carrier is unlocking your phone, you can opt for professional unlock service which could be of help. But finding such a professional service is not an easy task. There are some sites and service providers which require the IMEI number of the phone to create unlock codes. IMEI number of the phone is given to the professional SIM unlock service post which, they generate a special character combination which can be used to get the cell phone out of network restrictions. So, the phone can be unlocked remotely by using the special remote unlock codes.</p><p>Sometimes, the professional Smartphone service providers even ask for the phone to be sent to them to get the phone unlocked.</p><p><strong><em>Pros</em></strong></p><p>• This method could be opted as a last resort if there is no help from the carrier.</p><p>• Professional and reputable Smartphone unlock service providers tend to serve the purpose as they are specialized in this task.</p><p>• There are not many obligations involved.</p><p><strong>_Cons<br>_</strong></p><p>• This might attract legal actions against the user.</p><p>• It is very difficult to find such professional Smartphone unlock service providers.</p><p>• Reliability on such service providers is also another factor which requires attention.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Unlock-Android-to-Use-Any-SIM-via-Doctor-SIM"><a href="#Part-3-Unlock-Android-to-Use-Any-SIM-via-Doctor-SIM" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Unlock Android to Use Any SIM via Doctor SIM"></a>Part 3: Unlock Android to Use Any SIM via Doctor SIM</h2><p>Compared to connecting with your network provider, choosing an unlocking software may be a quicker and easier way. <a class="link"   href="https://www.doctorsim.com/gb-en/?scp" >Doctor SIM <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> could be a good option.

Unlock It Now"></a>Network Locked SIM Card Inserted On Your Honor 90 Phone? Unlock It Now</h2><p>Carriers provide cellular connections so you can access the Internet, send text messages, and make phone calls without Wi-Fi. You cannot escape the carriers once you begin using a cell phone.</p><p>Customers can purchase a new handset via carriers or the mobile phone market. You may need an unlocked phone if you wish to use a different carrier’s service on your smartphone. However, if you want a gadget linked to a specific SIM card, you may buy one from the carriers for a reduced price.</p><h2 id="Part-1-What-Does-It-Mean-If-Your-Honor-90-Asks-for-SIM-Network-PIN"><a href="#Part-1-What-Does-It-Mean-If-Your-Honor-90-Asks-for-SIM-Network-PIN" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What Does It Mean If Your Honor 90 Asks for SIM Network PIN?"></a>Part 1: What Does It Mean If Your Honor 90 Asks for SIM Network PIN?</h2><p>When your phone prompts you to enter a SIM Network Unlock PIN, it means that your device is currently locked to a specific mobile network carrier, and it can only be used with SIM cards from that carrier. This locking mechanism is usually put in place by the carrier or the phone manufacturer to ensure that you continue to use their services, typically for the duration of a contract. As a result, your phone cannot be freely used with SIM cards from other carriers until it’s unlocked using the correct PIN or code.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/11/fix-network-locked-simcard-inserted-01.jpg"                      alt="sim locked"                ></p><h2 id="Part-2-Why-Does-Your-Honor-90-Say-Invalid-SIM-Card-–-Network-Locked-SIM-Card-Inserted"><a href="#Part-2-Why-Does-Your-Honor-90-Say-Invalid-SIM-Card-–-Network-Locked-SIM-Card-Inserted" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Why Does Your Honor 90 Say Invalid SIM Card – Network Locked SIM Card Inserted?"></a>Part 2: Why Does Your Honor 90 Say Invalid SIM Card – Network Locked SIM Card Inserted?</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/11/fix-network-locked-simcard-inserted-2.jpg"                      alt="remove network lock"                ></p><p><strong>System Errors</strong></p><p>Since SIM locking is a smartphone restriction implemented to stop it from being used on other networks, Android system errors can cause network-locked SIM cards. Resetting these errors can help unlock your <strong>network locked SIM card inserted</strong> device. Service providers decided to provide a formal SIM unlocking option as a result.</p><p>Because of this, any locked SIM may be readily unlocked, and once a device opens, it can work like a conventional mobile phone and with any SIM card of the user’s choosing.</p><p><strong>Carrier Lock</strong></p><p>The consumer must stick with the same service provider for a specific time after purchasing the bundled device and data pack. This is called a carrier lock on the Honor 90 device and is one of the most common errors in <strong>network locked SIM card inserted</strong> devices. During that time, the Honor 90 device will be network- or SIM-locked, prohibiting the user from changing service providers.</p><p>The user cannot change the SIM. The service provider will offer the SIM Unlock code needed to unlock the handset when the contract expires. The gadget can be used with any other SIM card and exported to another country without problems when the network lock has been removed.</p><p><strong>Region Lock</strong></p><p>Apple and AT&amp;T initially worked together to implement the SIM lock and the SIM locked devices. The original purpose was to force the user to continue using the same service provider in a specific area or time.</p><p>However, some telecom service providers sell the handsets with select data plans as bundled plans in collaboration with the Honor 90 device manufacturers. As a result, the handset will cost less than it would otherwise. Sometimes, these offers are particular to a specific region, called a carrier lock.</p><p><strong>Firmware Problems</strong></p><p>Sometimes, the Honor 90 device manufacturers release many versions of the same firmware for different geographical locations.</p><p>As a result, it may be possible that the user may face contradictions in the agreement of device firmware and the network-locked SIM card that was supposed to be used on the Honor 90 device. Due to firmware problems, the users may also face a network-locked SIM card-inserted device.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/11/fix-network-locked-simcard-inserted-03.png"                      alt="unlock sim card"                ></p><h2 id="Part-3-How-to-Unlock-Network-Locked-SIM-Card-Inserted"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-Unlock-Network-Locked-SIM-Card-Inserted" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How to Unlock Network Locked SIM Card Inserted?"></a>Part 3: How to Unlock Network Locked SIM Card Inserted?</h2><p>Unlocking a network-locked SIM card may seem like a complex task.

It is the best sim-unlock tool for iPhone users. It enables users to safely unlock their devices within five minutes. With Dr.Fone, you don’t have to wait for the sim-unlock code or reset your device firmware that can remove all your data.</p><p>You can download Dr.Fone on your PC and use it to unlock your iPhone without data loss.

While typically requiring compliance with specific criteria, this method ensures you stay within your carrier’s policies.</p><p>Most carriers offer two common methods for unlocking their phones:</p><ul><li>**Paying an upfront fee.**If your contract period is still ongoing, certain carriers allow unlocking upon payment of a predetermined fee. Check your carrier’s website or contact customer support for eligibility and fee details.</li><li>**Requesting a SIM unlock.**Once your contract has expired and you meet the carrier’s eligibility criteria (e.g., device payment completion), you can submit an official unlock request. Carriers typically have dedicated online portals or customer service channels for this process.</li></ul><p>Remember, each carrier has its policies and procedures regarding unlocking. Consult your carrier’s official website or contact customer support for specific instructions and eligibility requirements.</p><h2 id="Conclusion-2"><a href="#Conclusion-2" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>Navigating the world of phone locks and restrictions can be daunting, but with the right information, you can unlock your device’s full potential.

No need to buy a new phone</strong></li></ul><p>If you want to switch to a different carrier, you may be tempted to buy a new phone that is compatible with that carrier.

But your phone pops up with a request for a PIN code to unlock it. What’s that all about, and what do you enter? There are two main reasons why your phone might be asking for a SIM PIN or unlock code:</p><p>SIM Network Lock</p><p>The SIM Network Lock is a restriction placed by your phone’s original network provider, locking it to their network. It means you can only use the Honor 90 Lite device with SIM cards from that specific carrier. Carriers use this to ensure that the phones they sell work only with their service. When you buy a subsidized phone, they want to ensure you stick around for the contract duration.</p><p>If you insert a SIM card from a different carrier, your phone will ask for a <strong>SIM Network Unlock PIN</strong> or Network Unlock Code (NUC). You’ll learn more about it in the upcoming sections of this article.</p><p>SIM Card Lock</p><p>SIM Card Lock is a security feature that protects your SIM card from unauthorized use on other devices. It requires you to enter a PIN (Personal Identification Number) to unlock the SIM card before you can use it.</p><p>The default PIN is usually printed on the back of the SIM card or its packaging. If you haven’t changed your PIN, use the 4-8 digit code provided by the carrier when you get your SIM card.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/02/sim-network-unlock-pin-02.jpg"                      alt="sim card lock pin"                ></p><p>If you’ve forgotten the <strong>SIM PIN code</strong>, you can use the PUK (PIN Unlock Key) code to unlock the SIM and set a new PIN. The PUK code is also printed on the SIM card packaging, but be careful, as entering the wrong PUK code too many times can permanently lock the SIM card.</p><p>Not knowing the <strong>SIM unlock PIN</strong> code can be frustrating, especially if you want to switch mobile carriers. So, in the next part, we’ll explore whether it’s possible to unlock a SIM network-locked iPhone device.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Can-a-SIM-Network-Locked-iPhone-Be-Unlocked"><a href="#Part-2-Can-a-SIM-Network-Locked-iPhone-Be-Unlocked" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Can a SIM Network Locked iPhone Be Unlocked?"></a>Part 2: Can a SIM Network Locked iPhone Be Unlocked?</h2><p>Yes, a SIM network-locked iPhone can be unlocked by your network provider.

It means you can use your phone with a SIM card from any compatible network provider, not just the one you originally bought it from. It is also known as Network Unlock PIN (NUP), Network Control Key (NCK), or Network Unlock Code (NUC).</p><p>Unlocking your device can be useful if you:</p><ul><li>Bought a phone locked to a specific carrier and want to switch to a different one.</li><li>Are planning a trip abroad and want to use a local SIM card instead.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/02/sim-network-unlock-pin-04.jpg"                      alt="international travel illustration"                ></p><ul><li>Still haven’t finished your contract with your original carrier and want to keep the phone but use a different service.</li><li>Bought a phone second-hand locked to the previous owner’s network.</li><li>Want to increase your phone’s resale value; unlocked phones generally have a higher resale value than locked phones, as various buyers can use them.</li><li>Want more carrier flexibility; you are not tied to one carrier and can choose the provider that best suits your needs in terms of price, coverage, data plans, and other features.</li></ul><p>Things To Consider</p><p>Before you proceed, here are some key points to remember:</p><ul><li>Eligibility: Not all phones are eligible for network unlocking. Check with your carrier or manufacturer for details.</li><li>Costs: While some carriers can give <strong>SIM network unlock PIN for free</strong>, others may charge a fee. Third-party unlocking services also typically charge a fee.</li><li>Waiting time: It can take days or even weeks to receive your <strong>SIM unlock PIN</strong>code from your carrier and process it. For instance, Vodafone usually unlocks the Honor 90 Lite device within 72 hours to 10 days if they have to reach the manufacturer.</li><li>Risks: Using an unauthorized unlocking method could damage your phone or void its warranty.</li><li>Backup: Before unlocking your phone, back up your data, as the process may erase it.</li></ul><p>Now that you understand <strong>SIM Network Unlock PIN</strong>, let’s get down to business!

Unlock It Now"></a>Network Locked SIM Card Inserted On Your Infinix Hot 40 Phone? Unlock It Now</h2><p>Carriers provide cellular connections so you can access the Internet, send text messages, and make phone calls without Wi-Fi. You cannot escape the carriers once you begin using a cell phone.</p><p>Customers can purchase a new handset via carriers or the mobile phone market. You may need an unlocked phone if you wish to use a different carrier’s service on your smartphone. However, if you want a gadget linked to a specific SIM card, you may buy one from the carriers for a reduced price.</p><h2 id="Part-1-What-Does-It-Mean-If-Your-Infinix-Hot-40-Asks-for-SIM-Network-PIN"><a href="#Part-1-What-Does-It-Mean-If-Your-Infinix-Hot-40-Asks-for-SIM-Network-PIN" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What Does It Mean If Your Infinix Hot 40 Asks for SIM Network PIN?"></a>Part 1: What Does It Mean If Your Infinix Hot 40 Asks for SIM Network PIN?</h2><p>When your phone prompts you to enter a SIM Network Unlock PIN, it means that your device is currently locked to a specific mobile network carrier, and it can only be used with SIM cards from that carrier. This locking mechanism is usually put in place by the carrier or the phone manufacturer to ensure that you continue to use their services, typically for the duration of a contract. As a result, your phone cannot be freely used with SIM cards from other carriers until it’s unlocked using the correct PIN or code.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/11/fix-network-locked-simcard-inserted-01.jpg"                      alt="sim locked"                ></p><h2 id="Part-2-Why-Does-Your-Infinix-Hot-40-Say-Invalid-SIM-Card-–-Network-Locked-SIM-Card-Inserted"><a href="#Part-2-Why-Does-Your-Infinix-Hot-40-Say-Invalid-SIM-Card-–-Network-Locked-SIM-Card-Inserted" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Why Does Your Infinix Hot 40 Say Invalid SIM Card – Network Locked SIM Card Inserted?"></a>Part 2: Why Does Your Infinix Hot 40 Say Invalid SIM Card – Network Locked SIM Card Inserted?</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/11/fix-network-locked-simcard-inserted-2.jpg"                      alt="remove network lock"                ></p><p><strong>System Errors</strong></p><p>Since SIM locking is a smartphone restriction implemented to stop it from being used on other networks, Android system errors can cause network-locked SIM cards. Resetting these errors can help unlock your <strong>network locked SIM card inserted</strong> device. Service providers decided to provide a formal SIM unlocking option as a result.</p><p>Because of this, any locked SIM may be readily unlocked, and once a device opens, it can work like a conventional mobile phone and with any SIM card of the user’s choosing.</p><p><strong>Carrier Lock</strong></p><p>The consumer must stick with the same service provider for a specific time after purchasing the bundled device and data pack. This is called a carrier lock on the Infinix Hot 40 device and is one of the most common errors in <strong>network locked SIM card inserted</strong> devices. During that time, the Infinix Hot 40 device will be network- or SIM-locked, prohibiting the user from changing service providers.</p><p>The user cannot change the SIM. The service provider will offer the SIM Unlock code needed to unlock the handset when the contract expires. The gadget can be used with any other SIM card and exported to another country without problems when the network lock has been removed.</p><p><strong>Region Lock</strong></p><p>Apple and AT&amp;T initially worked together to implement the SIM lock and the SIM locked devices. The original purpose was to force the user to continue using the same service provider in a specific area or time.</p><p>However, some telecom service providers sell the handsets with select data plans as bundled plans in collaboration with the Infinix Hot 40 device manufacturers. As a result, the handset will cost less than it would otherwise. Sometimes, these offers are particular to a specific region, called a carrier lock.</p><p><strong>Firmware Problems</strong></p><p>Sometimes, the Infinix Hot 40 device manufacturers release many versions of the same firmware for different geographical locations.</p><p>As a result, it may be possible that the user may face contradictions in the agreement of device firmware and the network-locked SIM card that was supposed to be used on the Infinix Hot 40 device. Due to firmware problems, the users may also face a network-locked SIM card-inserted device.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/11/fix-network-locked-simcard-inserted-03.png"                      alt="unlock sim card"                ></p><h2 id="Part-3-How-to-Unlock-Network-Locked-SIM-Card-Inserted"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-Unlock-Network-Locked-SIM-Card-Inserted" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How to Unlock Network Locked SIM Card Inserted?"></a>Part 3: How to Unlock Network Locked SIM Card Inserted?</h2><p>Unlocking a network-locked SIM card may seem like a complex task. However, it can be a straightforward process if you follow the right steps. In this section, we will guide you through the process of unlocking your network-locked SIM card. We will discuss 3 different ways you can unlock a <strong>network-locked SIM card inserted</strong>:</p><h3 id="Method-1-Contact-Network-Carrier-to-Unlock-Network-Locked-SIM"><a href="#Method-1-Contact-Network-Carrier-to-Unlock-Network-Locked-SIM" class="headerlink" title="Method 1. Contact Network Carrier to Unlock Network Locked SIM"></a>Method 1. Contact Network Carrier to Unlock Network Locked SIM</h3><p>Contacting your network carrier is often the most recommended choice. It is a straightforward and reliable method to unlock your network-locked SIM card. Unlocking your network-locked SIM card through your carrier is a reliable and legal method. Before contacting your carrier, get information like your device’s IMEI number and account details. There are several ways to get in touch with your network carrier’s customer support.</p><p>You can call the customer support hotline, visit the website, or go to a physical store. The process usually involves receiving an unlock network code, which you need to use. Once you’ve entered the unlock code, your phone should display that it’s now unlocked. Test it with the new SIM card to ensure that it can make calls, send texts, and access mobile data without any issues.</p><h3 id="Method-2-Use-Online-Unlock-Service-to-Unlock-Network-Locked-SIM"><a href="#Method-2-Use-Online-Unlock-Service-to-Unlock-Network-Locked-SIM" class="headerlink" title="Method 2. Use Online Unlock Service to Unlock Network Locked SIM"></a>Method 2. Use Online Unlock Service to Unlock Network Locked SIM</h3><p>There are many online services available for unlocking a <strong>network-locked SIM card</strong>. In case you don’t want to go through your network carrier, these can be a good alternative. These services employ the IMEI number of the Infinix Hot 40 device to unlock smartphones.</p><p>One such service is <a class="link"   href="https://canadaunlocking.com/" >Canada Unlocking <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, which offers to unlock your network-locked SIM card via email.

How to Unlock Network Locked Sim Card Inserted on iPhone?</h3><p>If you want a fast and easy method to unlock your network-locked iPhone, you can use a third-party tool such as Dr.Fone – Screen Unlock (iOS). It is the best sim-unlock tool for iPhone users. It enables users to safely unlock their devices within five minutes. With Dr.Fone, you don’t have to wait for the sim-unlock code or reset your device firmware that can remove all your data.</p><p>You can download Dr.Fone on your PC and use it to unlock your iPhone without data loss. You can also use Dr.Fone to unlock your iPhone’s screen lock and Apple ID. Although Dr.Fone is a one-stop solution for all of your phone-related problems, its sim-unlock only works for Apple devices. Here is how you unlock your carrier-locked iPhone with Dr.Fone – Screen Unlock (IOS).</p><ul><li>Download and install Dr.Fone on your PC. Launch the application and select the “Screen Unlock” tab from the list on the homepage.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/drfone-home.png"                      alt="homepage"                ></p><ul><li>Now, click on the “Remove SIM Locked” tab on the next page.

The process is compatible with devices running iOS 12 to iOS 14.8.1.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/remove-iphone-sim-4.png"                      alt="jailbreak instructions"                ></p><ul><li>Now, you have to complete three tasks on your iPhone. First, put the SIM card out of your device. Open “Settings” and tap on the “WIFI” option.

This guarantees that the Infinix Hot 40 device is only being used with the original SIM card for each provider. This locking also has a lot of drawbacks because it is incompatible with any other SIM card.</p><ol><li>The phone cannot be used with other SIM cards if the SIM lock is enabled. Customers must therefore adhere to the current plan as is.</li><li>Since nobody wants to purchase a locked phone, it is hard for someone to sell or gift the mobile.</li><li>Traveling abroad with a SIM-locked phone could provide some challenges because you won’t be able to use a local SIM card on the phone while you’re there.</li></ol><p>All the problems can be fixed, and the SIM works in any nation with the removed SIM lock.</p><h3 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h3><p>Any of the methods above can work to get around the prohibition against using other SIM cards with your Android handset. The best thing about using Dr.Fone-Screen Unlock is that you don’t need unlocking codes to complete the tasks.</p><h2 id="Top-10-Infinix-Hot-40-Android-SIM-Unlock-APK"><a href="#Top-10-Infinix-Hot-40-Android-SIM-Unlock-APK" class="headerlink" title="Top 10 Infinix Hot 40 Android SIM Unlock APK"></a>Top 10 Infinix Hot 40 Android SIM Unlock APK</h2><h2 id="Part-1-Top-10-Android-SIM-Unlock-APKs"><a href="#Part-1-Top-10-Android-SIM-Unlock-APKs" class="headerlink" title="Part 1.

Unlock It Now"></a>Network Locked SIM Card Inserted On Your Google Pixel 8 Phone? Unlock It Now</h2><p>Carriers provide cellular connections so you can access the Internet, send text messages, and make phone calls without Wi-Fi. You cannot escape the carriers once you begin using a cell phone.</p><p>Customers can purchase a new handset via carriers or the mobile phone market. You may need an unlocked phone if you wish to use a different carrier’s service on your smartphone. However, if you want a gadget linked to a specific SIM card, you may buy one from the carriers for a reduced price.</p><h2 id="Part-1-What-Does-It-Mean-If-Your-Google-Pixel-8-Asks-for-SIM-Network-PIN"><a href="#Part-1-What-Does-It-Mean-If-Your-Google-Pixel-8-Asks-for-SIM-Network-PIN" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What Does It Mean If Your Google Pixel 8 Asks for SIM Network PIN?"></a>Part 1: What Does It Mean If Your Google Pixel 8 Asks for SIM Network PIN?</h2><p>When your phone prompts you to enter a SIM Network Unlock PIN, it means that your device is currently locked to a specific mobile network carrier, and it can only be used with SIM cards from that carrier. This locking mechanism is usually put in place by the carrier or the phone manufacturer to ensure that you continue to use their services, typically for the duration of a contract. As a result, your phone cannot be freely used with SIM cards from other carriers until it’s unlocked using the correct PIN or code.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/11/fix-network-locked-simcard-inserted-01.jpg"                      alt="sim locked"                ></p><h2 id="Part-2-Why-Does-Your-Google-Pixel-8-Say-Invalid-SIM-Card-–-Network-Locked-SIM-Card-Inserted"><a href="#Part-2-Why-Does-Your-Google-Pixel-8-Say-Invalid-SIM-Card-–-Network-Locked-SIM-Card-Inserted" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Why Does Your Google Pixel 8 Say Invalid SIM Card – Network Locked SIM Card Inserted?"></a>Part 2: Why Does Your Google Pixel 8 Say Invalid SIM Card – Network Locked SIM Card Inserted?</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/11/fix-network-locked-simcard-inserted-2.jpg"                      alt="remove network lock"                ></p><p><strong>System Errors</strong></p><p>Since SIM locking is a smartphone restriction implemented to stop it from being used on other networks, Android system errors can cause network-locked SIM cards. Resetting these errors can help unlock your <strong>network locked SIM card inserted</strong> device. Service providers decided to provide a formal SIM unlocking option as a result.</p><p>Because of this, any locked SIM may be readily unlocked, and once a device opens, it can work like a conventional mobile phone and with any SIM card of the user’s choosing.</p><p><strong>Carrier Lock</strong></p><p>The consumer must stick with the same service provider for a specific time after purchasing the bundled device and data pack. This is called a carrier lock on the Google Pixel 8 device and is one of the most common errors in <strong>network locked SIM card inserted</strong> devices. During that time, the Google Pixel 8 device will be network- or SIM-locked, prohibiting the user from changing service providers.</p><p>The user cannot change the SIM. The service provider will offer the SIM Unlock code needed to unlock the handset when the contract expires. The gadget can be used with any other SIM card and exported to another country without problems when the network lock has been removed.</p><p><strong>Region Lock</strong></p><p>Apple and AT&amp;T initially worked together to implement the SIM lock and the SIM locked devices. The original purpose was to force the user to continue using the same service provider in a specific area or time.</p><p>However, some telecom service providers sell the handsets with select data plans as bundled plans in collaboration with the Google Pixel 8 device manufacturers. As a result, the handset will cost less than it would otherwise. Sometimes, these offers are particular to a specific region, called a carrier lock.</p><p><strong>Firmware Problems</strong></p><p>Sometimes, the Google Pixel 8 device manufacturers release many versions of the same firmware for different geographical locations.</p><p>As a result, it may be possible that the user may face contradictions in the agreement of device firmware and the network-locked SIM card that was supposed to be used on the Google Pixel 8 device. Due to firmware problems, the users may also face a network-locked SIM card-inserted device.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/11/fix-network-locked-simcard-inserted-03.png"                      alt="unlock sim card"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2136625/26400" target="_top" id="2136625">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2136625" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/i/5597632/2136625/26400"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-3-How-to-Unlock-Network-Locked-SIM-Card-Inserted"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-Unlock-Network-Locked-SIM-Card-Inserted" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How to Unlock Network Locked SIM Card Inserted?"></a>Part 3: How to Unlock Network Locked SIM Card Inserted?</h2><p>Unlocking a network-locked SIM card may seem like a complex task.

This guarantees that the Google Pixel 8 device is only being used with the original SIM card for each provider. This locking also has a lot of drawbacks because it is incompatible with any other SIM card.</p><ol><li>The phone cannot be used with other SIM cards if the SIM lock is enabled. Customers must therefore adhere to the current plan as is.</li><li>Since nobody wants to purchase a locked phone, it is hard for someone to sell or gift the mobile.</li><li>Traveling abroad with a SIM-locked phone could provide some challenges because you won’t be able to use a local SIM card on the phone while you’re there.</li></ol><p>All the problems can be fixed, and the SIM works in any nation with the removed SIM lock.</p><h3 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h3><p>Any of the methods above can work to get around the prohibition against using other SIM cards with your Android handset.

Phones are our life source in this global age, it’s our tether to reality, to the world! But if you have a carrier locked phone, then that connection is basically under contract by an external agency! You can’t change your networks, there are limitations on how you use your phone, and when you have to travel abroad you have no option other than paying the roaming charges. If you, say, have an iPhone 5c and have these frustrations, it’s likely you’re already wondering how to unlock the iPhone 5c.</p><p>Chances are that if you’ve had a carrier locked phone for a while, you might have already forgotten what cellular freedom feels like. But we’re here to remind you. All you have to do is break that carrier-lock, and you’re good to go. However, you should be careful when doing so, cause if you try using a jailbreaking technique, it could have major repercussions. So we’re here to give you some valuable advice about how to unlock iPhone 5, iPhone 5c, or even Android phones.</p><h2 id="Part-1-Unlock-SIM-Card-on-Google-Pixel-8-via-jailbreak"><a href="#Part-1-Unlock-SIM-Card-on-Google-Pixel-8-via-jailbreak" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Unlock SIM Card on Google Pixel 8 via jailbreak"></a>Part 1: Unlock SIM Card on Google Pixel 8 via jailbreak</h2><p>Before we get into telling you how to unlock iPhone 5, or the SIM Card on iPhone or Android, we should first tell you what Jailbreaking is. You might have heard of this term before, and I’m sure it sounded ominous to you. Jailbreak? It sounds awfully close to ‘Prison break.’ Well, considering the carrier lock is sort of like a prison for your cell, it is an accurate terminology. But Jailbreak isn’t just about breaking the carrier lock. That might happen as a by-product, but the real purpose is to break free of the software restrictions which are generally applied to Apple devices. This might seem like a good option because, well, who doesn’t want to break free of all of Apple’s restrictions? But that always comes at several heavy risks.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1934188/19272" target="_top" id="1934188">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1934188" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1934188/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Threats-of-unlocking-SIM-via-Jailbreak"><a href="#Threats-of-unlocking-SIM-via-Jailbreak" class="headerlink" title="Threats of unlocking SIM via Jailbreak"></a>Threats of unlocking SIM via Jailbreak</h3><h4 id="1-Not-Permanent"><a href="#1-Not-Permanent" class="headerlink" title="1. Not Permanent"></a>1. Not Permanent</h4><p>This has got to be one of the biggest reasons for not jailbreaking your phone. It is not at all permanent! In fact, the moment you update your system, your jailbreak is lost and if you’ve started using a different SIM it will no longer function, and you’re gonna have to go back to using that Carrier you tried so hard to escape from! It’s really not worth the effort. Of course, you could stop updating altogether, but then that will bring us to…</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2016/10/14771444107532.jpg"                      alt="Unlock SIM Card on iPhone and Android via jailbreak"                ></p><h4 id="2-Risky"><a href="#2-Risky" class="headerlink" title="2.

Now those who do jailbreak regularly will give you all kinds of excuses like it happens only rarely or that you can retrieve your data simply from the cloud, et al.

By unlocking your phone’s SIM card, you will be able to use any carrier’s SIM card, giving you the freedom to choose the carrier that best suits your needs.</p><ul><li><strong>2. Cost savings</strong></li></ul><p>By unlocking your phone’s SIM card, you can save money on roaming charges when traveling.

Resale value</strong></li></ul><p>An unlocked phone has a higher resale value than a carrier-locked phone. This is because an unlocked phone can be used with any carrier’s SIM card, making it more attractive to buyers.</p><ul><li><strong>4. No need to buy a new phone</strong></li></ul><p>If you want to switch to a different carrier, you may be tempted to buy a new phone that is compatible with that carrier.

Your SIM locks itself after three to five wrong inputs, on average. Although it might be annoying, doing these guards against unauthorized access to your phone and personal data. If your cell phone is lost or stolen, PUK blocked will prevent prospective hackers from making calls.</p><p>Your mobile phone display can say “PIN blocked” or “Enter PUK code.” PUK stands for PIN Unblocking Key in the PUK code. The PUK code is seldom given to you when you receive your membership in the US. Contact Your Itel P55T provider’s customer support if you don’t know your PUK code.</p><h2 id="Part-1-Why-Was-My-Sim-Card-Blocked"><a href="#Part-1-Why-Was-My-Sim-Card-Blocked" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Why Was My Sim Card Blocked?"></a>Part 1: Why Was My Sim Card Blocked?</h2><h3 id="1-3-times-incorrect-Pin-entered"><a href="#1-3-times-incorrect-Pin-entered" class="headerlink" title="1. 3 times incorrect Pin entered"></a>1. 3 times incorrect Pin entered</h3><p>Sometimes when you forget your pin and keep on entering the wrong one, you can get PUK Blocked.

Wrong PUK code entered"></a>2. Wrong PUK code entered</h3><p>Sims are frequently blocked; therefore, if you have your PUK, keep it in a secure location separate from your phone. This is because it is the key to unlocking your SIM. The SIM will be permanently disabled, and you will have to buy a new SIM card if you input the wrong PUK ten times in a row.</p><h2 id="Part-2-What-To-Do-When-I-Blocked-My-Sim-Card"><a href="#Part-2-What-To-Do-When-I-Blocked-My-Sim-Card" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: What To Do When I Blocked My Sim Card?"></a>Part 2: What To Do When I Blocked My Sim Card?</h2><p>Your SIM card has been disabled to protect your security if you enter three wrong PINs and your phone shows “SIM card banned” or “Enter PUK code”.</p><p>You must input a PUK (PIN Unlock Key) code to unlock your SIM card.</p><p>Go to your phone’s settings to customize your PIN code after using a PUK code to unlock your SIM card.

Have it from carrier website</h3><p>In all honesty, I doubt I’ll ever be able to locate my SIM card package again, and I imagine most people feel the same way.</p><p>But happily, a lot of cell companies let you access your account on their app or website to check your SIM card PUK. Please log in to the appropriate website or app, then go to your profile to see whether anything about “PUK” is available there.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/10/how-to-unlock-puk-blocked-sim-card-5.jpg"                      alt="go to career website and check your sim card puk"                ></p><p>It shouldn’t be an issue if you were utilizing or signed in to the platform before your SIM was disabled. However, if not, you might not be able to access anything since you could be asked to input an OTP to verify your identity.</p><p>Please remove the SIM card and try again if you can’t access your phone to utilize the app or website because of the SIM lock. After receiving the PUK code, you can re-insert the SIM and input it.</p><h3 id="3-Contact-your-carrier"><a href="#3-Contact-your-carrier" class="headerlink" title="3. Contact your carrier"></a>3. Contact your carrier</h3><p>It’s time to call customer support, which should be simpler for most individuals if none of the above options work for you. For example, your mobile service provider created your SIM card. Therefore, they have all the information you would require. Before they divulge anything to you, though, they should be able to verify your identity.</p><p>Use a different phone to call your customer service number and describe the issue. And following a series of inquiries, they should offer your PUK number as identification.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/10/how-to-unlock-puk-blocked-sim-card-6.jpg"                      alt="solve the sim card not accessed issue"                ></p><p>However, customer service won’t release the code if you can’t back yourself up. And at that point, there’s probably nothing further you can do. Therefore, make sure you have some information, such as your name, address, date of birth, etc., before you call them.</p><h2 id="Part-4-Easy-Tool-For-Sim-Card-Unlock"><a href="#Part-4-Easy-Tool-For-Sim-Card-Unlock" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: Easy Tool For Sim Card Unlock"></a>Part 4: Easy Tool For Sim Card Unlock</h2><p>If you want to unlock your PUK blocked sim card, you can use a network unlock tool like Dr.Fone.

Unlock It Now"></a>Network Locked SIM Card Inserted On Your Xiaomi 14 Ultra Phone? Unlock It Now</h2><p>Carriers provide cellular connections so you can access the Internet, send text messages, and make phone calls without Wi-Fi. You cannot escape the carriers once you begin using a cell phone.</p><p>Customers can purchase a new handset via carriers or the mobile phone market. You may need an unlocked phone if you wish to use a different carrier’s service on your smartphone. However, if you want a gadget linked to a specific SIM card, you may buy one from the carriers for a reduced price.</p><h2 id="Part-1-What-Does-It-Mean-If-Your-Xiaomi-14-Ultra-Asks-for-SIM-Network-PIN"><a href="#Part-1-What-Does-It-Mean-If-Your-Xiaomi-14-Ultra-Asks-for-SIM-Network-PIN" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What Does It Mean If Your Xiaomi 14 Ultra Asks for SIM Network PIN?"></a>Part 1: What Does It Mean If Your Xiaomi 14 Ultra Asks for SIM Network PIN?</h2><p>When your phone prompts you to enter a SIM Network Unlock PIN, it means that your device is currently locked to a specific mobile network carrier, and it can only be used with SIM cards from that carrier. This locking mechanism is usually put in place by the carrier or the phone manufacturer to ensure that you continue to use their services, typically for the duration of a contract. As a result, your phone cannot be freely used with SIM cards from other carriers until it’s unlocked using the correct PIN or code.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/11/fix-network-locked-simcard-inserted-01.jpg"                      alt="sim locked"                ></p><h2 id="Part-2-Why-Does-Your-Xiaomi-14-Ultra-Say-Invalid-SIM-Card-–-Network-Locked-SIM-Card-Inserted"><a href="#Part-2-Why-Does-Your-Xiaomi-14-Ultra-Say-Invalid-SIM-Card-–-Network-Locked-SIM-Card-Inserted" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Why Does Your Xiaomi 14 Ultra Say Invalid SIM Card – Network Locked SIM Card Inserted?"></a>Part 2: Why Does Your Xiaomi 14 Ultra Say Invalid SIM Card – Network Locked SIM Card Inserted?</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/11/fix-network-locked-simcard-inserted-2.jpg"                      alt="remove network lock"                ></p><p><strong>System Errors</strong></p><p>Since SIM locking is a smartphone restriction implemented to stop it from being used on other networks, Android system errors can cause network-locked SIM cards. Resetting these errors can help unlock your <strong>network locked SIM card inserted</strong> device. Service providers decided to provide a formal SIM unlocking option as a result.</p><p>Because of this, any locked SIM may be readily unlocked, and once a device opens, it can work like a conventional mobile phone and with any SIM card of the user’s choosing.</p><p><strong>Carrier Lock</strong></p><p>The consumer must stick with the same service provider for a specific time after purchasing the bundled device and data pack. This is called a carrier lock on the Xiaomi 14 Ultra device and is one of the most common errors in <strong>network locked SIM card inserted</strong> devices. During that time, the Xiaomi 14 Ultra device will be network- or SIM-locked, prohibiting the user from changing service providers.</p><p>The user cannot change the SIM. The service provider will offer the SIM Unlock code needed to unlock the handset when the contract expires. The gadget can be used with any other SIM card and exported to another country without problems when the network lock has been removed.</p><p><strong>Region Lock</strong></p><p>Apple and AT&amp;T initially worked together to implement the SIM lock and the SIM locked devices. The original purpose was to force the user to continue using the same service provider in a specific area or time.</p><p>However, some telecom service providers sell the handsets with select data plans as bundled plans in collaboration with the Xiaomi 14 Ultra device manufacturers. As a result, the handset will cost less than it would otherwise. Sometimes, these offers are particular to a specific region, called a carrier lock.</p><p><strong>Firmware Problems</strong></p><p>Sometimes, the Xiaomi 14 Ultra device manufacturers release many versions of the same firmware for different geographical locations.</p><p>As a result, it may be possible that the user may face contradictions in the agreement of device firmware and the network-locked SIM card that was supposed to be used on the Xiaomi 14 Ultra device. Due to firmware problems, the users may also face a network-locked SIM card-inserted device.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/11/fix-network-locked-simcard-inserted-03.png"                      alt="unlock sim card"                ></p><h2 id="Part-3-How-to-Unlock-Network-Locked-SIM-Card-Inserted"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-Unlock-Network-Locked-SIM-Card-Inserted" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How to Unlock Network Locked SIM Card Inserted?"></a>Part 3: How to Unlock Network Locked SIM Card Inserted?</h2><p>Unlocking a network-locked SIM card may seem like a complex task.

This guarantees that the Xiaomi 14 Ultra device is only being used with the original SIM card for each provider. This locking also has a lot of drawbacks because it is incompatible with any other SIM card.</p><ol><li>The phone cannot be used with other SIM cards if the SIM lock is enabled. Customers must therefore adhere to the current plan as is.</li><li>Since nobody wants to purchase a locked phone, it is hard for someone to sell or gift the mobile.</li><li>Traveling abroad with a SIM-locked phone could provide some challenges because you won’t be able to use a local SIM card on the phone while you’re there.</li></ol><p>All the problems can be fixed, and the SIM works in any nation with the removed SIM lock.</p><h3 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h3><p>Any of the methods above can work to get around the prohibition against using other SIM cards with your Android handset.

Therefore, if you travel frequently around the world, having an unlocked Xiaomi 14 Ultra would be beneficial. Using a local SIM card is much cheaper than paying for exorbitant roaming charges.</p><p>You can also benefit from an unlocked Xiaomi 14 Ultra if you are the kind of person who likes to take advantage of current offers provided by your local carriers. Prepaid plans are always changing in terms of offering so having the flexibility of changing carriers and prepaid plans can help you save money in the long run.</p><h2 id="Part-6-The-downside-of-an-unlocked-Xiaomi-14-Ultra"><a href="#Part-6-The-downside-of-an-unlocked-Xiaomi-14-Ultra" class="headerlink" title="Part 6: The downside of an unlocked Xiaomi 14 Ultra"></a>Part 6: The downside of an unlocked Xiaomi 14 Ultra</h2><p>Are you thinking “Well, why can’t I just buy an unlocked Xiaomi 14 Ultra in the first place?” right about now? Well, you can but think of the amount of money it will cost you.</p><p>For example, in Australia, an unlocked Xiaomi 14 Ultra will cost around $499 from any Xiaomi outlet but $0 for the Xiaomi 14 Ultra device when you pair it with a 24-month postpaid plan. While this may look attractive now, you may be paying more for a locked Xiaomi 14 Ultra in the long run.</p><h2 id="Conclusion-1"><a href="#Conclusion-1" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>Now that you know the three ways of unlocking your Xiaomi 14 Ultra, all you need to do is find one that is most compatible with you.

But your phone pops up with a request for a PIN code to unlock it. What’s that all about, and what do you enter? There are two main reasons why your phone might be asking for a SIM PIN or unlock code:</p><p>SIM Network Lock</p><p>The SIM Network Lock is a restriction placed by your phone’s original network provider, locking it to their network. It means you can only use the Xiaomi 14 Ultra device with SIM cards from that specific carrier. Carriers use this to ensure that the phones they sell work only with their service. When you buy a subsidized phone, they want to ensure you stick around for the contract duration.</p><p>If you insert a SIM card from a different carrier, your phone will ask for a <strong>SIM Network Unlock PIN</strong> or Network Unlock Code (NUC). You’ll learn more about it in the upcoming sections of this article.</p><p>SIM Card Lock</p><p>SIM Card Lock is a security feature that protects your SIM card from unauthorized use on other devices. It requires you to enter a PIN (Personal Identification Number) to unlock the SIM card before you can use it.</p><p>The default PIN is usually printed on the back of the SIM card or its packaging. If you haven’t changed your PIN, use the 4-8 digit code provided by the carrier when you get your SIM card.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/02/sim-network-unlock-pin-02.jpg"                      alt="sim card lock pin"                ></p><p>If you’ve forgotten the <strong>SIM PIN code</strong>, you can use the PUK (PIN Unlock Key) code to unlock the SIM and set a new PIN. The PUK code is also printed on the SIM card packaging, but be careful, as entering the wrong PUK code too many times can permanently lock the SIM card.</p><p>Not knowing the <strong>SIM unlock PIN</strong> code can be frustrating, especially if you want to switch mobile carriers. So, in the next part, we’ll explore whether it’s possible to unlock a SIM network-locked iPhone device.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2115937/19272" target="_top" id="2115937">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2115937" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2115937/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-2-Can-a-SIM-Network-Locked-iPhone-Be-Unlocked"><a href="#Part-2-Can-a-SIM-Network-Locked-iPhone-Be-Unlocked" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Can a SIM Network Locked iPhone Be Unlocked?"></a>Part 2: Can a SIM Network Locked iPhone Be Unlocked?</h2><p>Yes, a SIM network-locked iPhone can be unlocked by your network provider.

Check with your carrier or manufacturer for details.</li><li>Costs: While some carriers can give <strong>SIM network unlock PIN for free</strong>, others may charge a fee. Third-party unlocking services also typically charge a fee.</li><li>Waiting time: It can take days or even weeks to receive your <strong>SIM unlock PIN</strong>code from your carrier and process it. For instance, Vodafone usually unlocks the Xiaomi 14 Ultra device within 72 hours to 10 days if they have to reach the manufacturer.</li><li>Risks: Using an unauthorized unlocking method could damage your phone or void its warranty.</li><li>Backup: Before unlocking your phone, back up your data, as the process may erase it.</li></ul><p>Now that you understand <strong>SIM Network Unlock PIN</strong>, let’s get down to business!

Get Your Honor 90 Lite Phone Network-Ready</h2><p>A network-locked device tethers you to one carrier, limiting your choices. You might miss out on better deals, struggle with roaming charges abroad, or feel inconvenienced by limited coverage. And you can’t avoid these things without the right <strong>SIM network unlock PIN</strong>.</p><p>That’s why we’ve created this comprehensive guide to help you unlock your phone’s potential. This article will explain what a <strong>SIM network unlock PIN</strong> is, the process involved, and answer any questions you might have. Keep scrolling to learn more.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/02/sim-network-unlock-pin-01.jpg"                      alt="enter sim network unlock pin"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-Why-Is-Your-Honor-90-Lite-Asking-for-a-SIM-Network-Unlock-PIN"><a href="#Part-1-Why-Is-Your-Honor-90-Lite-Asking-for-a-SIM-Network-Unlock-PIN" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Why Is Your Honor 90 Lite Asking for a SIM Network Unlock PIN?"></a>Part 1: Why Is Your Honor 90 Lite Asking for a SIM Network Unlock PIN?</h2><p>You just bought a new phone, excited to use it with a new SIM card. But your phone pops up with a request for a PIN code to unlock it. What’s that all about, and what do you enter? There are two main reasons why your phone might be asking for a SIM PIN or unlock code:</p><p>SIM Network Lock</p><p>The SIM Network Lock is a restriction placed by your phone’s original network provider, locking it to their network. It means you can only use the Honor 90 Lite device with SIM cards from that specific carrier. Carriers use this to ensure that the phones they sell work only with their service. When you buy a subsidized phone, they want to ensure you stick around for the contract duration.</p><p>If you insert a SIM card from a different carrier, your phone will ask for a <strong>SIM Network Unlock PIN</strong> or Network Unlock Code (NUC). You’ll learn more about it in the upcoming sections of this article.</p><p>SIM Card Lock</p><p>SIM Card Lock is a security feature that protects your SIM card from unauthorized use on other devices. It requires you to enter a PIN (Personal Identification Number) to unlock the SIM card before you can use it.</p><p>The default PIN is usually printed on the back of the SIM card or its packaging. If you haven’t changed your PIN, use the 4-8 digit code provided by the carrier when you get your SIM card.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/02/sim-network-unlock-pin-02.jpg"                      alt="sim card lock pin"                ></p><p>If you’ve forgotten the <strong>SIM PIN code</strong>, you can use the PUK (PIN Unlock Key) code to unlock the SIM and set a new PIN. The PUK code is also printed on the SIM card packaging, but be careful, as entering the wrong PUK code too many times can permanently lock the SIM card.</p><p>Not knowing the <strong>SIM unlock PIN</strong> code can be frustrating, especially if you want to switch mobile carriers. So, in the next part, we’ll explore whether it’s possible to unlock a SIM network-locked iPhone device.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1880956/19272" target="_top" id="1880956">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1880956" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1880956/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-2-Can-a-SIM-Network-Locked-iPhone-Be-Unlocked"><a href="#Part-2-Can-a-SIM-Network-Locked-iPhone-Be-Unlocked" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Can a SIM Network Locked iPhone Be Unlocked?"></a>Part 2: Can a SIM Network Locked iPhone Be Unlocked?</h2><p>Yes, a SIM network-locked iPhone can be unlocked by your network provider.

It means you can use your phone with a SIM card from any compatible network provider, not just the one you originally bought it from. It is also known as Network Unlock PIN (NUP), Network Control Key (NCK), or Network Unlock Code (NUC).</p><p>Unlocking your device can be useful if you:</p><ul><li>Bought a phone locked to a specific carrier and want to switch to a different one.</li><li>Are planning a trip abroad and want to use a local SIM card instead.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/02/sim-network-unlock-pin-04.jpg"                      alt="international travel illustration"                ></p><ul><li>Still haven’t finished your contract with your original carrier and want to keep the phone but use a different service.</li><li>Bought a phone second-hand locked to the previous owner’s network.</li><li>Want to increase your phone’s resale value; unlocked phones generally have a higher resale value than locked phones, as various buyers can use them.</li><li>Want more carrier flexibility; you are not tied to one carrier and can choose the provider that best suits your needs in terms of price, coverage, data plans, and other features.</li></ul><p>Things To Consider</p><p>Before you proceed, here are some key points to remember:</p><ul><li>Eligibility: Not all phones are eligible for network unlocking. Check with your carrier or manufacturer for details.</li><li>Costs: While some carriers can give <strong>SIM network unlock PIN for free</strong>, others may charge a fee. Third-party unlocking services also typically charge a fee.</li><li>Waiting time: It can take days or even weeks to receive your <strong>SIM unlock PIN</strong>code from your carrier and process it. For instance, Vodafone usually unlocks the Honor 90 Lite device within 72 hours to 10 days if they have to reach the manufacturer.</li><li>Risks: Using an unauthorized unlocking method could damage your phone or void its warranty.</li><li>Backup: Before unlocking your phone, back up your data, as the process may erase it.</li></ul><p>Now that you understand <strong>SIM Network Unlock PIN</strong>, let’s get down to business!

Just try one of the following.</p><p><strong><em>Ask your Carrier to Unlock your Device</em></strong></p><p>This is the best option when you want to safely unlock your device. By February 2015, American cell phone owners got the option to request their carriers to unlock their device for them. Before that the law didn’t allow for carriers to unlock SIM cards in the United States. This unpopular law was reversed following a similar move by the European Union in 2013. The same law also requires that the carriers inform customers every month whether their device is eligible for unlocking.</p><p>If your device is eligible for unlocking, all you need to do is contact the carrier provide and request for the <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/unlock/unlock-samsung-sim-network-unlock-pin.html" >sim network unlock pin <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.

For Smartphones that are not on contract, you have to wait 12 months from the date of purchase and ensure that your bill is paid before the carrier can give you the unlock code.</p><p><strong><em>How to Unlock your Android Phone</em></strong></p><p>To begin with, you need to confirm your IMEI number. Dial *#06# on your device and the IMEI number will appear on the screen. Copy this number to a secure location or wrote it down somewhere.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2016/06/14670084741192.jpg"                      alt="How to Unlock your Android Phone"                ></p><p>The next step is to find a reputable service that will unlock your Android device for you. This is action you should take only if you are absolutely desperate and your carrier can’t unlock your device for you. This is because many of these sites are unregulated and many of them are not reliable.</p><p>You should also know that many of them will charge a certain amount for your service. You can try <a class="link"   href="https://www.safeunlockcode.com/" >https://www.safeunlockcode.com/ <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> which is one of the more reputable ones we have found.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2016/06/14670084936436.jpg"                      alt="android SIM unlock-safeunlockcode"                ></p><p>You will need to enter the IMEI number as part of the information you need to provide before they can unlock your device.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Troubleshooting-Android-SIM-Unlock"><a href="#Part-3-Troubleshooting-Android-SIM-Unlock" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Troubleshooting Android SIM Unlock"></a>Part 3: Troubleshooting Android SIM Unlock</h2><p>There are lots of issues you may face when you try to unlock your device. The following are just some of the troubleshooting actions you can take if you encounter these problems.</p><p><strong><em>Unlocking Code Fails to work</em></strong></p><p>If you asked your carrier to unlock your device for you, chances are that they sent you a code. If the unlocking code fails to work double check that the IMEI number you used is the correct one and ensure that you purchased that device from that carrier and then try again.</p><p><strong><em>Samsung Device Freezes during unlocking</em></strong></p><p>If your device freezes during the unlocking process it typically means that you entered wrong unlocking code too many times. In this case you need to contact the carrier for a Master Code.</p><p><strong><em>My LG device won’t unlock</em></strong></p><p>There are some LG models that cannot be unlocked. These models include LG U300, LG U310, LG U8180, LG U8330, LG U8120, LG U8360, LG U8380, LGU880, and LG U890. If your device is one of these it can’t be unlocked by your carrier.

Therefore, changing your device’s IMEI number may void your device warranty and cause other issues such as network problems and software instability.</li><li>Legally, you have forfeited your ownership of your mobile device. When you purchase your device, the seller will jot down the original IMEI number on your receipt. So if you changed your IMEI and lost it, you may not be able to claim it.

Therefore, if you travel frequently around the world, having an unlocked Xiaomi Redmi K70 Pro would be beneficial. Using a local SIM card is much cheaper than paying for exorbitant roaming charges.</p><p>You can also benefit from an unlocked Xiaomi Redmi K70 Pro if you are the kind of person who likes to take advantage of current offers provided by your local carriers. Prepaid plans are always changing in terms of offering so having the flexibility of changing carriers and prepaid plans can help you save money in the long run.</p><h2 id="Part-6-The-downside-of-an-unlocked-Xiaomi-Redmi-K70-Pro"><a href="#Part-6-The-downside-of-an-unlocked-Xiaomi-Redmi-K70-Pro" class="headerlink" title="Part 6: The downside of an unlocked Xiaomi Redmi K70 Pro"></a>Part 6: The downside of an unlocked Xiaomi Redmi K70 Pro</h2><p>Are you thinking “Well, why can’t I just buy an unlocked Xiaomi Redmi K70 Pro in the first place?” right about now? Well, you can but think of the amount of money it will cost you.</p><p>For example, in Australia, an unlocked Xiaomi Redmi K70 Pro will cost around $499 from any Xiaomi outlet but $0 for the Xiaomi Redmi K70 Pro device when you pair it with a 24-month postpaid plan. While this may look attractive now, you may be paying more for a locked Xiaomi Redmi K70 Pro in the long run.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2111981/7443" target="_top" id="2111981">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2111981" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2111981/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Conclusion-1"><a href="#Conclusion-1" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>Now that you know the three ways of unlocking your Xiaomi Redmi K70 Pro, all you need to do is find one that is most compatible with you.

This would cause problems if for instance you wanted to travel outside the country and want to switch to that country’s carrier for the duration of your stay. Or maybe you just want to switch carriers because you don’t like your current provider.</p><p>Whatever the reason, you should be able to unlock your device easily. But this has often proven difficult because of the fact that you need unlock codes. The problem is that many sites promise free unlocking codes for your device and many turn out to be fraudulent sites that use the word “free” in their advertising but actually require you to pay for the service. If you have been unsuccessfully searching for free unlocking codes for your device, look no further. This article compiles three of the best for Android and iPhone.</p><h2 id="Part-1-3-Ways-to-Find-Unlocking-Codes-for-Android-Devices"><a href="#Part-1-3-Ways-to-Find-Unlocking-Codes-for-Android-Devices" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: 3 Ways to Find Unlocking Codes for Android Devices"></a>Part 1: 3 Ways to Find Unlocking Codes for Android Devices</h2><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/c/5597632/2134494/18498" target="_top" id="2134494">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18498-2134494" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="721" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/i/5597632/2134494/18498"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="1-Unlock-it-Free"><a href="#1-Unlock-it-Free" class="headerlink" title="1.

Phones are our life source in this global age, it’s our tether to reality, to the world! But if you have a carrier locked phone, then that connection is basically under contract by an external agency! You can’t change your networks, there are limitations on how you use your phone, and when you have to travel abroad you have no option other than paying the roaming charges. If you, say, have an iPhone 5c and have these frustrations, it’s likely you’re already wondering how to unlock the iPhone 5c.</p><p>Chances are that if you’ve had a carrier locked phone for a while, you might have already forgotten what cellular freedom feels like. But we’re here to remind you. All you have to do is break that carrier-lock, and you’re good to go. However, you should be careful when doing so, cause if you try using a jailbreaking technique, it could have major repercussions. So we’re here to give you some valuable advice about how to unlock iPhone 5, iPhone 5c, or even Android phones.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1915805/19272" target="_top" id="1915805">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1915805" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1915805/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-1-Unlock-SIM-Card-on-Poco-X6-Pro-via-jailbreak"><a href="#Part-1-Unlock-SIM-Card-on-Poco-X6-Pro-via-jailbreak" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Unlock SIM Card on Poco X6 Pro via jailbreak"></a>Part 1: Unlock SIM Card on Poco X6 Pro via jailbreak</h2><p>Before we get into telling you how to unlock iPhone 5, or the SIM Card on iPhone or Android, we should first tell you what Jailbreaking is. You might have heard of this term before, and I’m sure it sounded ominous to you. Jailbreak? It sounds awfully close to ‘Prison break.’ Well, considering the carrier lock is sort of like a prison for your cell, it is an accurate terminology. But Jailbreak isn’t just about breaking the carrier lock. That might happen as a by-product, but the real purpose is to break free of the software restrictions which are generally applied to Apple devices. This might seem like a good option because, well, who doesn’t want to break free of all of Apple’s restrictions? But that always comes at several heavy risks.</p><h3 id="Threats-of-unlocking-SIM-via-Jailbreak"><a href="#Threats-of-unlocking-SIM-via-Jailbreak" class="headerlink" title="Threats of unlocking SIM via Jailbreak"></a>Threats of unlocking SIM via Jailbreak</h3><h4 id="1-Not-Permanent"><a href="#1-Not-Permanent" class="headerlink" title="1.

In fact, the moment you update your system, your jailbreak is lost and if you’ve started using a different SIM it will no longer function, and you’re gonna have to go back to using that Carrier you tried so hard to escape from! It’s really not worth the effort. Of course, you could stop updating altogether, but then that will bring us to…</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2016/10/14771444107532.jpg"                      alt="Unlock SIM Card on iPhone and Android via jailbreak"                ></p><h4 id="2-Risky"><a href="#2-Risky" class="headerlink" title="2.

Warranty"></a>3. Warranty</h4><p>Jailbreaking has now become kind-of-legal, in a very tenuous sense, but that doesn’t mean Apple wholeheartedly welcomes jailbreaking. If you do so, you will never again be able to avail of the warranty on your phone. And with the kind of major bucks you have to shell out for those iPhones, you best keep that warranty intact.</p><h4 id="4-Lack-of-Apps"><a href="#4-Lack-of-Apps" class="headerlink" title="4. Lack of Apps"></a>4. Lack of Apps</h4><p>Many top-notch and crucial app companies and organizations simply refuse to make their applications usable in jailbreak phones, as they are extremely risky and prone to hacking. As a result, you would have to rely on a bunch of non-professional apps made by amateurs, which is more likely to put your phone in harm’s way.</p><h4 id="5-Bricking"><a href="#5-Bricking" class="headerlink" title="5. Bricking"></a>5. Bricking</h4><p>This basically means your whole system may crash and stop functioning. As a result, you’re gonna’ have to restore the whole thing and try to salvage whatever information you can. Now those who do jailbreak regularly will give you all kinds of excuses like it happens only rarely or that you can retrieve your data simply from the cloud, et al. But do you really want to divest all your time and energy trying to fight off malware, backing up all your data, etc, especially when there is a much more convenient option just around the corner?</p><p>Didn’t think so.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-unlock-SIM-Card-on-iPhone-without-jailbreak-Bonus"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-unlock-SIM-Card-on-iPhone-without-jailbreak-Bonus" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to unlock SIM Card on iPhone without jailbreak[Bonus]"></a>Part 2: How to unlock SIM Card on iPhone without jailbreak[Bonus]</h2><p>As mentioned above, unlocking by jailbreaking is risky and only temporary.

Up until a while back, one of the reasons people chose to jailbreak their phones is because the legitimate means was such a headache in which you had to contact the carrier and request a change, and even then they could refuse after several weeks of ‘verification.’ However, now with the slow introduction of apps that can essentially do all the work for you, within a matter of 48 hours, it really makes no sense to jailbreak. So now we’ll tell you how to unlock iPhone 5c using an Online iPhone unlock tool called DoctorSIM Unlock Service.</p><p>SIM Unlock Service is really quite the revolutionary tool which just needs your IMEI code and can do all the work for you and send you the unlock code within a guaranteed period of 48 hours! It is safe, it is legal, it is hassle-free, and it doesn’t even lapse your warranty, which proves that it is an officially approved means of unlocking your iPhone. However, before we tell you how to unlock iPhone 5, you should probably be able to verify if your phone is unlocked already.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2135408/19272" target="_top" id="2135408">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2135408" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="120" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2135408/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-4-How-to-unlock-SIM-Card-on-iPhone-with-iPhoneIMEI-net-without-jailbreak"><a href="#Part-4-How-to-unlock-SIM-Card-on-iPhone-with-iPhoneIMEI-net-without-jailbreak" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: How to unlock SIM Card on iPhone with iPhoneIMEI.net without jailbreak"></a>Part 4: How to unlock SIM Card on iPhone with iPhoneIMEI.net without jailbreak</h2><p><a class="link"   href="https://appleiphoneunlock.uk/network/Special%20Services/Activation%20Lock?aff=wondershare" >iPhoneIMEI.net <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> uses an official method to unlock iPhone devices and whitelist your IMEI from Apple’s database.

You loved the Tecno Pova 5 device but your network provider does not have any plans that exactly suit your needs. To release your device from your current network’s clutches, you will need to unlock your phone.</p><p>There are three ways you can do it and this post will go through each method so that you can find one that you are most comfortable with. Do note that if your contract has ended with your network provider, this “How to unlock Tecno Pova 5” post can be skipped as you can just ask them to unlock your phone or purchase a <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/unlock/unlock-samsung-sim-network-unlock-pin.html" >sim network unlock pin <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> for a minimal price.</p><h2 id="Part-1-Tecno-Pova-5-Unlock-Code"><a href="#Part-1-Tecno-Pova-5-Unlock-Code" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Tecno Pova 5 Unlock Code"></a>Part 1: Tecno Pova 5 Unlock Code</h2><p>This is probably the easiest, no-fuss method to <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/unlock-android-screen/" >sim unlock <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> Tecno Pova 5. Follow these steps carefully to successfully perform Tecno Pova 5 unlock code.</p><p>Do take note that this process may not work with your carrier. Therefore, always check if this is the right way to obtain the necessary code:</p><ul><li>1. Check the SIM lock status—you can do this by dialing <strong>*#*#7378423#*#*</strong>.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2016/08/14707989592943.jpg"                      alt="sony xperia unlock code"                ></p><ul><li>2.

Find the <strong>IMEI number</strong> by dialing <strong>*#06#</strong>. Jot it down as this will be your code.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2016/08/14707998453087.jpg"                      alt="sony unlock code"                ></p><ul><li>5. Insert your new SIM card and tap in the IMEI number when it asks you for SIM network unlock PIN.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2016/08/unlock-screen.jpg"                      alt="sony unlock screen"                ></p><p>If you have followed these steps to a tee, you should have unlocked your device.

Do note that there may be fees involved.</li><li>Once your customer service representative has determined if you have met all their requirements, they should give you the SIM network unlock PIN Tecno Pova 5. Again, depending on your carrier, they might either give you the code over the phone, through email or via SMS. If you have the choice, always opt for email or SMS so that you are able to jot down the right number.</li><li>Once you have gotten the code, insert the new SIM card (from your new carrier). You will receive a prompt to enter your code. Make sure that you key in the right code—entering the wrong code will cause your phone to be locked (possibly forever).</li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2016/08/unlock-screen.jpg"                      alt="sony unlock screen"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2049390/7443" target="_top" id="2049390">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2049390" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2049390/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-4-Tecno-Pova-5-Unlock-App-Software"><a href="#Part-4-Tecno-Pova-5-Unlock-App-Software" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: Tecno Pova 5 Unlock App&#x2F;Software"></a>Part 4: Tecno Pova 5 Unlock App&#x2F;Software</h2><p>There are some of us out there who are just not confident with doing things ourselves or trusting our own carrier.</p><p>HOWEVER, if your first instinct is to head to Google Play to look for SIM unlock tools, heed these cautions.

Therefore, if you travel frequently around the world, having an unlocked Tecno Pova 5 would be beneficial. Using a local SIM card is much cheaper than paying for exorbitant roaming charges.</p><p>You can also benefit from an unlocked Tecno Pova 5 if you are the kind of person who likes to take advantage of current offers provided by your local carriers. Prepaid plans are always changing in terms of offering so having the flexibility of changing carriers and prepaid plans can help you save money in the long run.</p><h2 id="Part-6-The-downside-of-an-unlocked-Tecno-Pova-5"><a href="#Part-6-The-downside-of-an-unlocked-Tecno-Pova-5" class="headerlink" title="Part 6: The downside of an unlocked Tecno Pova 5"></a>Part 6: The downside of an unlocked Tecno Pova 5</h2><p>Are you thinking “Well, why can’t I just buy an unlocked Tecno Pova 5 in the first place?” right about now? Well, you can but think of the amount of money it will cost you.</p><p>For example, in Australia, an unlocked Tecno Pova 5 will cost around $499 from any Tecno outlet but $0 for the Tecno Pova 5 device when you pair it with a 24-month postpaid plan. While this may look attractive now, you may be paying more for a locked Tecno Pova 5 in the long run.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2100526/7443" target="_top" id="2100526">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2100526" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2100526/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>Now that you know the three ways of unlocking your Tecno Pova 5, all you need to do is find one that is most compatible with you.

Just try one of the following.</p><p><strong><em>Ask your Carrier to Unlock your Device</em></strong></p><p>This is the best option when you want to safely unlock your device. By February 2015, American cell phone owners got the option to request their carriers to unlock their device for them. Before that the law didn’t allow for carriers to unlock SIM cards in the United States. This unpopular law was reversed following a similar move by the European Union in 2013. The same law also requires that the carriers inform customers every month whether their device is eligible for unlocking.</p><p>If your device is eligible for unlocking, all you need to do is contact the carrier provide and request for the <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/unlock/unlock-samsung-sim-network-unlock-pin.html" >sim network unlock pin <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. But if your Smartphone was bought on a contract, you may need to pay a termination fee to break the contract of you want to unlock the Tecno Pova 5 device before the contact term expires. For Smartphones that are not on contract, you have to wait 12 months from the date of purchase and ensure that your bill is paid before the carrier can give you the unlock code.</p><p><strong><em>How to Unlock your Android Phone</em></strong></p><p>To begin with, you need to confirm your IMEI number. Dial *#06# on your device and the IMEI number will appear on the screen. Copy this number to a secure location or wrote it down somewhere.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2016/06/14670084741192.jpg"                      alt="How to Unlock your Android Phone"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2144310/7443" target="_top" id="2144310">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2144310" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2144310/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>The next step is to find a reputable service that will unlock your Android device for you. This is action you should take only if you are absolutely desperate and your carrier can’t unlock your device for you. This is because many of these sites are unregulated and many of them are not reliable.</p><p>You should also know that many of them will charge a certain amount for your service. You can try <a class="link"   href="https://www.safeunlockcode.com/" >https://www.safeunlockcode.com/ <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> which is one of the more reputable ones we have found.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2016/06/14670084936436.jpg"                      alt="android SIM unlock-safeunlockcode"                ></p><p>You will need to enter the IMEI number as part of the information you need to provide before they can unlock your device.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Troubleshooting-Android-SIM-Unlock"><a href="#Part-3-Troubleshooting-Android-SIM-Unlock" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Troubleshooting Android SIM Unlock"></a>Part 3: Troubleshooting Android SIM Unlock</h2><p>There are lots of issues you may face when you try to unlock your device. The following are just some of the troubleshooting actions you can take if you encounter these problems.</p><p><strong><em>Unlocking Code Fails to work</em></strong></p><p>If you asked your carrier to unlock your device for you, chances are that they sent you a code. If the unlocking code fails to work double check that the IMEI number you used is the correct one and ensure that you purchased that device from that carrier and then try again.</p><p><strong><em>Samsung Device Freezes during unlocking</em></strong></p><p>If your device freezes during the unlocking process it typically means that you entered wrong unlocking code too many times. In this case you need to contact the carrier for a Master Code.</p><p><strong><em>My LG device won’t unlock</em></strong></p><p>There are some LG models that cannot be unlocked. These models include LG U300, LG U310, LG U8180, LG U8330, LG U8120, LG U8360, LG U8380, LGU880, and LG U890. If your device is one of these it can’t be unlocked by your carrier.

This would cause problems if for instance you wanted to travel outside the country and want to switch to that country’s carrier for the duration of your stay. Or maybe you just want to switch carriers because you don’t like your current provider.</p><p>Whatever the reason, you should be able to unlock your device easily. But this has often proven difficult because of the fact that you need unlock codes. The problem is that many sites promise free unlocking codes for your device and many turn out to be fraudulent sites that use the word “free” in their advertising but actually require you to pay for the service. If you have been unsuccessfully searching for free unlocking codes for your device, look no further.

Therefore, changing your device’s IMEI number may void your device warranty and cause other issues such as network problems and software instability.</li><li>Legally, you have forfeited your ownership of your mobile device. When you purchase your device, the seller will jot down the original IMEI number on your receipt. So if you changed your IMEI and lost it, you may not be able to claim it. This is because authorities cannot see if it is truly yours.

Locked phones may look much safer to you, but they are very inconvenient when it comes to normal use. These phones are bound to one carrier only, which is their biggest disadvantage. At the same time, unlocked phones save you from this hassle.</p><p>If you’ve bought a locked phone and facing problems, you need not worry as there are multiple ways to unlock your phone.

An unlocked phone is not pinned to a single SIM carrier; rather, it lets you switch carriers. SIM Card lets your phone connect to a specific network, but it depends on your phone’s hardware compatibility. If it’s not compatible with a specific network, then nothing can change that.</p><p>To unlock your phone, you have to enter a specific code to remove the restrictions of the network.

Root access allows you to do almost everything on the phone you’ve gained access to, like installing or uninstalling applications or changing the settings.</p><p>Root access is not all fun, and games as this process will lead you to the security architect of your operating system, which will be hard to deal with even if you’re a professional.

It is also considered free booting, and Apple or any other company does not approve of it.</p><p>In summary, unlocking is primarily about freeing a device from carrier restrictions, rooting is specific to Android devices and involves gaining administrative access, while jailbreaking is specific to iOS devices and involves bypassing Apple’s restrictions for more customization. All these processes come with potential risks and may void warranties, so users should carefully consider the implications before proceeding.</p><p>It is advisable to always go for the safest method, unlocking your phone.

The International Mobile Equipment Identity (IMEI) is a unique 15-digit number assigned to every mobile device, such as smartphones and tablets. This number serves as an identifier, helping to distinguish your device from millions of others. One of the main reasons people want to change their Android IMEI number is to unblock a device that has been blacklisted by their network provider. Other reasons include accessing certain network features and services or maintaining anonymity.</p><p>Changing your Android IMEI without root access may seem like a daunting task, but this comprehensive guide will walk you through the process step-by-step. Before proceeding, please note that altering your device’s IMEI number can be illegal in some countries, and may void your warranty. Proceed with caution and at your own risk. Get to know <strong>how to change IMEI number</strong> now!</p><h2 id="Part-1-What-is-IMEI-and-Why-People-Change-The-IMEI-Number"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-IMEI-and-Why-People-Change-The-IMEI-Number" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What is IMEI and Why People Change The IMEI Number"></a>Part 1: What is IMEI and Why People Change The IMEI Number</h2><p>The International Mobile Equipment Identity (IMEI) is a unique identifier for every mobile device. It allows network providers and manufacturers to track and block devices if they are reported as lost or stolen. Changing your device’s IMEI can help to unblock a blacklisted device, access certain network features and services, or maintain anonymity. However, be aware that altering your IMEI number is illegal in some countries and may void your warranty.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/05/imei-number.jpg"                      alt="imei number"                ></p><h3 id="There-are-several-uses-of-the-IMEI-number"><a href="#There-are-several-uses-of-the-IMEI-number" class="headerlink" title="There are several uses of the IMEI number"></a>There are several uses of the IMEI number</h3><ol><li>As the use of mobile devices increases, the statistics of stolen and lost devices have been increasing as well. Users can block stolen or lost devices for further usage if they know their IMEI number. All users need to call their network carrier and report that the Realme 12+ 5G device is stolen or lost. The carrier can block the specific device from running on their network and notify other carriers.</li><li>The 15-digit IMEI number indicates the origin and model of the Realme 12+ 5G device. The first eight digits indicate the Realme 12+ 5G device’s origin and its model while the last six digits identify the Realme 12+ 5G device’s manufacturer.</li><li>If you subscribe to a mobile tracking service, you can use the IMEI number to track the Realme 12+ 5G device—even if it uses a different SIM card.</li></ol><h3 id="Pros-and-Cons-of-Changing-Android-IMEI"><a href="#Pros-and-Cons-of-Changing-Android-IMEI" class="headerlink" title="Pros and Cons of Changing Android IMEI"></a>Pros and Cons of Changing Android IMEI</h3><p>Like many other things out there, changing Android IMEI has both advantages and disadvantages. Here are some of them:</p><p><strong>Advantages</strong></p><ol><li>Make your Android untraceable. By constantly changing your IMEI, you will throw off the tracks of people using it to stalk you!</li><li>Fix any invalid IMEI-related issues such as lost or invalid IMEI numbers. Once you change your IMEI, your Android device with the same benefits and features.</li><li>Obtaining a completely new device ID.</li><li>Changing the IMEI number to one that indicates it is a newer model, you will be able to enjoy new OS updates by resetting, repairing, and updating your Android device.</li><li>Have you ever yearned for that cheap BlackBerry plan your network carrier keeps on promoting? The 15-digit IMEI indicates the origin and model of your device. Therefore, by changing your Android’s IMEI number to that of a BlackBerry’s, you will be able to subscribe to a cheaper mobile plan.</li></ol><p><strong>Disadvantages</strong></p><ol><li>Before we begin, we need to make it clear that the process of changing IMEI without root can be illegal in some countries. We advise you to check the laws and regulations in your country before attempting to change your device’s IMEI number. As far as we know, it is legal in Africa and Asia, and illegal in Europe.</li><li>The IMEI number is hardcoded into your device. Therefore, changing your device’s IMEI number may void your device warranty and cause other issues such as network problems and software instability.</li><li>Legally, you have forfeited your ownership of your mobile device. When you purchase your device, the seller will jot down the original IMEI number on your receipt. So if you changed your IMEI and lost it, you may not be able to claim it. This is because authorities cannot see if it is truly yours. After all, the IMEI numbers no longer correlate with each other.</li></ol><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Find-the-IMEI-on-an-Android-5-Ways"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Find-the-IMEI-on-an-Android-5-Ways" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Find the IMEI on an Android?

Before that the law didn’t allow for carriers to unlock SIM cards in the United States. This unpopular law was reversed following a similar move by the European Union in 2013. The same law also requires that the carriers inform customers every month whether their device is eligible for unlocking.</p><p>If your device is eligible for unlocking, all you need to do is contact the carrier provide and request for the <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/unlock/unlock-samsung-sim-network-unlock-pin.html" >sim network unlock pin <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.

Dial *#06# on your device and the IMEI number will appear on the screen. Copy this number to a secure location or wrote it down somewhere.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2016/06/14670084741192.jpg"                      alt="How to Unlock your Android Phone"                ></p><p>The next step is to find a reputable service that will unlock your Android device for you.

The following are just some of the troubleshooting actions you can take if you encounter these problems.</p><p><strong><em>Unlocking Code Fails to work</em></strong></p><p>If you asked your carrier to unlock your device for you, chances are that they sent you a code.

This 4-digit code protects your phone number from unauthorized calls, texts, and data use. It’s essential to change the default PIN to one that’s both memorable for you and difficult for others to guess.</p><p>So, <strong>how to change the PIN on an Android phone</strong>’s SIM card? This article will provide a step-by-step guide to help you secure your data. But first, let’s explore why changing the default one is important.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/02/how-to-change-pin-on-android-phone-01.jpg"                      alt="a phone sim card"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-Why-Does-Changing-Your-SIM-PIN-Code-Matter-on-a-New-Phone"><a href="#Part-1-Why-Does-Changing-Your-SIM-PIN-Code-Matter-on-a-New-Phone" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Why Does Changing Your SIM PIN Code Matter on a New Phone?"></a>Part 1: Why Does Changing Your SIM PIN Code Matter on a New Phone?</h2><p>Your SIM PIN code acts as a password for your SIM card, which stores your phone number, contacts, and other essential data. Unlike the PIN you use to unlock your phone, the SIM PIN code is a separate layer of security. If someone tries to use your SIM card in another phone without the correct PIN, they won’t be able to access your network or data.</p><p>Here are more reasons why <strong>changing the PIN code of a SIM card</strong> is a smart move:</p><ul><li>Default PINs are easy to guess</li></ul><p>Most carriers use generic PINs like “1234” or “0000”. Change it to something unique and harder to crack.</p><ul><li>Protects data in case of loss or theft</li></ul><p>If you lose your phone or it gets stolen, a strong PIN code hinders the thief’s ability to make calls, send messages, or access your data stored on the SIM. It buys you time to report the loss and block your SIM card before they can do any damage.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/02/how-to-change-pin-on-android-phone-02.jpg"                      alt="sim card locked"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/c/5597632/2134237/18498" target="_top" id="2134237">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18498-2134237" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/i/5597632/2134237/18498"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><ul><li>Prevents accidental PIN lockouts</li></ul><p>Using a memorable PIN minimizes the risk of accidentally locking yourself out of your SIM card.</p><ul><li>Peace of mind</li></ul><p>It is crucial if you store sensitive info on your SIM or use your phone for work. Knowing about this extra safeguard is reassuring, ensuring your data stays protected.</p><p><strong>Remember:</strong></p><p>Choose a PIN code for your SIM that’s easy for you to remember but challenging for others to guess. Avoid using birthdays, anniversaries, or other easily identifiable information. By taking a few minutes to <strong>change the PIN code of the SIM card</strong>, you’ll gain a significant security advantage for your new phone and data.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-To-Change-Pin-on-Android-Phone-SIM-Cards"><a href="#Part-2-How-To-Change-Pin-on-Android-Phone-SIM-Cards" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How To Change Pin on Android Phone SIM Cards?"></a>Part 2: How To Change Pin on Android Phone SIM Cards?</h2><p>Keeping your SIM card secure is crucial for protecting your data and privacy. Thankfully, Android allows you to easily change your SIM card PIN to a more personal and memorable code. But before you begin:</p><ul><li>Contact your network carrier to get your PUK code if you already have it. You’ll need this if you enter the wrong PIN three times and lock your SIM card.</li><li>Remember the temporary default PIN: Most SIM cards have a default PIN, often 1234 or 0123.

You’ll need your network carrier’s PUK code to unlock it. Use it cautiously, as exceeding the maximum number of attempts will permanently block your SIM card.

But for iPhone users, forgetting it can lock you out. So, what should you do if you <strong>lose the SIM PIN</strong> code on iOS?</p><p>First, avoid guessing your SIM PIN or PUK code. Every wrong guess increases the risk of permanently locking your SIM card, requiring a replacement. If you forget your PIN, contact your network carrier for help.

If that fails, you can request a new SIM card.</p><p>However, there might also be situations where you’re locked out due to a carrier-restricted SIM card.

This locking mechanism is usually put in place by the carrier or the phone manufacturer to ensure that you continue to use their services, typically for the duration of a contract.

Resetting these errors can help unlock your <strong>network locked SIM card inserted</strong> device. Service providers decided to provide a formal SIM unlocking option as a result.</p><p>Because of this, any locked SIM may be readily unlocked, and once a device opens, it can work like a conventional mobile phone and with any SIM card of the user’s choosing.</p><p><strong>Carrier Lock</strong></p><p>The consumer must stick with the same service provider for a specific time after purchasing the bundled device and data pack. This is called a carrier lock on the Realme Narzo N55 device and is one of the most common errors in <strong>network locked SIM card inserted</strong> devices. During that time, the Realme Narzo N55 device will be network- or SIM-locked, prohibiting the user from changing service providers.</p><p>The user cannot change the SIM. The service provider will offer the SIM Unlock code needed to unlock the handset when the contract expires. The gadget can be used with any other SIM card and exported to another country without problems when the network lock has been removed.</p><p><strong>Region Lock</strong></p><p>Apple and AT&amp;T initially worked together to implement the SIM lock and the SIM locked devices. The original purpose was to force the user to continue using the same service provider in a specific area or time.</p><p>However, some telecom service providers sell the handsets with select data plans as bundled plans in collaboration with the Realme Narzo N55 device manufacturers. As a result, the handset will cost less than it would otherwise. Sometimes, these offers are particular to a specific region, called a carrier lock.</p><p><strong>Firmware Problems</strong></p><p>Sometimes, the Realme Narzo N55 device manufacturers release many versions of the same firmware for different geographical locations.</p><p>As a result, it may be possible that the user may face contradictions in the agreement of device firmware and the network-locked SIM card that was supposed to be used on the Realme Narzo N55 device. Due to firmware problems, the users may also face a network-locked SIM card-inserted device.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/11/fix-network-locked-simcard-inserted-03.png"                      alt="unlock sim card"                ></p><h2 id="Part-3-How-to-Unlock-Network-Locked-SIM-Card-Inserted"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-Unlock-Network-Locked-SIM-Card-Inserted" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How to Unlock Network Locked SIM Card Inserted?"></a>Part 3: How to Unlock Network Locked SIM Card Inserted?</h2><p>Unlocking a network-locked SIM card may seem like a complex task.

Get Your Xiaomi Redmi Note 13 5G Phone Network-Ready</h2><p>A network-locked device tethers you to one carrier, limiting your choices. You might miss out on better deals, struggle with roaming charges abroad, or feel inconvenienced by limited coverage. And you can’t avoid these things without the right <strong>SIM network unlock PIN</strong>.</p><p>That’s why we’ve created this comprehensive guide to help you unlock your phone’s potential. This article will explain what a <strong>SIM network unlock PIN</strong> is, the process involved, and answer any questions you might have.

But your phone pops up with a request for a PIN code to unlock it. What’s that all about, and what do you enter? There are two main reasons why your phone might be asking for a SIM PIN or unlock code:</p><p>SIM Network Lock</p><p>The SIM Network Lock is a restriction placed by your phone’s original network provider, locking it to their network. It means you can only use the Xiaomi Redmi Note 13 5G device with SIM cards from that specific carrier. Carriers use this to ensure that the phones they sell work only with their service. When you buy a subsidized phone, they want to ensure you stick around for the contract duration.</p><p>If you insert a SIM card from a different carrier, your phone will ask for a <strong>SIM Network Unlock PIN</strong> or Network Unlock Code (NUC). You’ll learn more about it in the upcoming sections of this article.</p><p>SIM Card Lock</p><p>SIM Card Lock is a security feature that protects your SIM card from unauthorized use on other devices. It requires you to enter a PIN (Personal Identification Number) to unlock the SIM card before you can use it.</p><p>The default PIN is usually printed on the back of the SIM card or its packaging. If you haven’t changed your PIN, use the 4-8 digit code provided by the carrier when you get your SIM card.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/02/sim-network-unlock-pin-02.jpg"                      alt="sim card lock pin"                ></p><p>If you’ve forgotten the <strong>SIM PIN code</strong>, you can use the PUK (PIN Unlock Key) code to unlock the SIM and set a new PIN. The PUK code is also printed on the SIM card packaging, but be careful, as entering the wrong PUK code too many times can permanently lock the SIM card.</p><p>Not knowing the <strong>SIM unlock PIN</strong> code can be frustrating, especially if you want to switch mobile carriers.
