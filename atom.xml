All these processes come with potential risks and may void warranties, so users should carefully consider the implications before proceeding.</p><p>It is advisable to always go for the safest method, unlocking your phone.

Therefore, changing your device’s IMEI number may void your device warranty and cause other issues such as network problems and software instability.</li><li>Legally, you have forfeited your ownership of your mobile device. When you purchase your device, the seller will jot down the original IMEI number on your receipt. So if you changed your IMEI and lost it, you may not be able to claim it.

While typically requiring compliance with specific criteria, this method ensures you stay within your carrier’s policies.</p><p>Most carriers offer two common methods for unlocking their phones:</p><ul><li>**Paying an upfront fee.**If your contract period is still ongoing, certain carriers allow unlocking upon payment of a predetermined fee. Check your carrier’s website or contact customer support for eligibility and fee details.</li><li>**Requesting a SIM unlock.**Once your contract has expired and you meet the carrier’s eligibility criteria (e.g., device payment completion), you can submit an official unlock request. Carriers typically have dedicated online portals or customer service channels for this process.</li></ul><p>Remember, each carrier has its policies and procedures regarding unlocking. Consult your carrier’s official website or contact customer support for specific instructions and eligibility requirements.</p><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>Navigating the world of phone locks and restrictions can be daunting, but with the right information, you can unlock your device’s full potential.

Phones are our life source in this global age, it’s our tether to reality, to the world! But if you have a carrier locked phone, then that connection is basically under contract by an external agency! You can’t change your networks, there are limitations on how you use your phone, and when you have to travel abroad you have no option other than paying the roaming charges. If you, say, have an iPhone 5c and have these frustrations, it’s likely you’re already wondering how to unlock the iPhone 5c.</p><p>Chances are that if you’ve had a carrier locked phone for a while, you might have already forgotten what cellular freedom feels like. But we’re here to remind you. All you have to do is break that carrier-lock, and you’re good to go. However, you should be careful when doing so, cause if you try using a jailbreaking technique, it could have major repercussions. So we’re here to give you some valuable advice about how to unlock iPhone 5, iPhone 5c, or even Android phones.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2047351/19272" target="_top" id="2047351">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2047351" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2047351/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-1-Unlock-SIM-Card-on-Realme-GT-3-via-jailbreak"><a href="#Part-1-Unlock-SIM-Card-on-Realme-GT-3-via-jailbreak" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Unlock SIM Card on Realme GT 3 via jailbreak"></a>Part 1: Unlock SIM Card on Realme GT 3 via jailbreak</h2><p>Before we get into telling you how to unlock iPhone 5, or the SIM Card on iPhone or Android, we should first tell you what Jailbreaking is. You might have heard of this term before, and I’m sure it sounded ominous to you. Jailbreak? It sounds awfully close to ‘Prison break.’ Well, considering the carrier lock is sort of like a prison for your cell, it is an accurate terminology. But Jailbreak isn’t just about breaking the carrier lock. That might happen as a by-product, but the real purpose is to break free of the software restrictions which are generally applied to Apple devices. This might seem like a good option because, well, who doesn’t want to break free of all of Apple’s restrictions? But that always comes at several heavy risks.</p><h3 id="Threats-of-unlocking-SIM-via-Jailbreak"><a href="#Threats-of-unlocking-SIM-via-Jailbreak" class="headerlink" title="Threats of unlocking SIM via Jailbreak"></a>Threats of unlocking SIM via Jailbreak</h3><h4 id="1-Not-Permanent"><a href="#1-Not-Permanent" class="headerlink" title="1. Not Permanent"></a>1. Not Permanent</h4><p>This has got to be one of the biggest reasons for not jailbreaking your phone. It is not at all permanent! In fact, the moment you update your system, your jailbreak is lost and if you’ve started using a different SIM it will no longer function, and you’re gonna have to go back to using that Carrier you tried so hard to escape from! It’s really not worth the effort. Of course, you could stop updating altogether, but then that will bring us to…</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2016/10/14771444107532.jpg"                      alt="Unlock SIM Card on iPhone and Android via jailbreak"                ></p><h4 id="2-Risky"><a href="#2-Risky" class="headerlink" title="2. Risky"></a>2. Risky</h4><p>If you don’t update your iOS, or Mac or iPad or any device at all, in this day and age, you’re basically just asking to be hacked. That is not to excuse those who do the hacking and plant malware on your system, but if you leave your front door open in a shitty neighborhood, well then you only have yourself to blame once you get robbed!</p><h4 id="3-Warranty"><a href="#3-Warranty" class="headerlink" title="3. Warranty"></a>3. Warranty</h4><p>Jailbreaking has now become kind-of-legal, in a very tenuous sense, but that doesn’t mean Apple wholeheartedly welcomes jailbreaking. If you do so, you will never again be able to avail of the warranty on your phone. And with the kind of major bucks you have to shell out for those iPhones, you best keep that warranty intact.</p><h4 id="4-Lack-of-Apps"><a href="#4-Lack-of-Apps" class="headerlink" title="4. Lack of Apps"></a>4. Lack of Apps</h4><p>Many top-notch and crucial app companies and organizations simply refuse to make their applications usable in jailbreak phones, as they are extremely risky and prone to hacking. As a result, you would have to rely on a bunch of non-professional apps made by amateurs, which is more likely to put your phone in harm’s way.</p><h4 id="5-Bricking"><a href="#5-Bricking" class="headerlink" title="5. Bricking"></a>5. Bricking</h4><p>This basically means your whole system may crash and stop functioning. As a result, you’re gonna’ have to restore the whole thing and try to salvage whatever information you can. Now those who do jailbreak regularly will give you all kinds of excuses like it happens only rarely or that you can retrieve your data simply from the cloud, et al. But do you really want to divest all your time and energy trying to fight off malware, backing up all your data, etc, especially when there is a much more convenient option just around the corner?</p><p>Didn’t think so.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-unlock-SIM-Card-on-iPhone-without-jailbreak-Bonus"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-unlock-SIM-Card-on-iPhone-without-jailbreak-Bonus" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to unlock SIM Card on iPhone without jailbreak[Bonus]"></a>Part 2: How to unlock SIM Card on iPhone without jailbreak[Bonus]</h2><p>As mentioned above, unlocking by jailbreaking is risky and only temporary. Therefore, this is not a very good choice. Honestly, a professional and reliable SIM unlock software is the best option. The good news for iPhone users is coming!

Up until a while back, one of the reasons people chose to jailbreak their phones is because the legitimate means was such a headache in which you had to contact the carrier and request a change, and even then they could refuse after several weeks of ‘verification.’ However, now with the slow introduction of apps that can essentially do all the work for you, within a matter of 48 hours, it really makes no sense to jailbreak. So now we’ll tell you how to unlock iPhone 5c using an Online iPhone unlock tool called DoctorSIM Unlock Service.</p><p>SIM Unlock Service is really quite the revolutionary tool which just needs your IMEI code and can do all the work for you and send you the unlock code within a guaranteed period of 48 hours! It is safe, it is legal, it is hassle-free, and it doesn’t even lapse your warranty, which proves that it is an officially approved means of unlocking your iPhone. However, before we tell you how to unlock iPhone 5, you should probably be able to verify if your phone is unlocked already.</p><h2 id="Part-4-How-to-unlock-SIM-Card-on-iPhone-with-iPhoneIMEI-net-without-jailbreak"><a href="#Part-4-How-to-unlock-SIM-Card-on-iPhone-with-iPhoneIMEI-net-without-jailbreak" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: How to unlock SIM Card on iPhone with iPhoneIMEI.net without jailbreak"></a>Part 4: How to unlock SIM Card on iPhone with iPhoneIMEI.net without jailbreak</h2><p><a class="link"   href="https://appleiphoneunlock.uk/network/Special%20Services/Activation%20Lock?aff=wondershare" >iPhoneIMEI.net <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> uses an official method to unlock iPhone devices and whitelist your IMEI from Apple’s database.

You loved the Honor 80 Pro Straight Screen Edition device but your network provider does not have any plans that exactly suit your needs. To release your device from your current network’s clutches, you will need to unlock your phone.</p><p>There are three ways you can do it and this post will go through each method so that you can find one that you are most comfortable with. Do note that if your contract has ended with your network provider, this “How to unlock Honor 80 Pro Straight Screen Edition” post can be skipped as you can just ask them to unlock your phone or purchase a <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/unlock/unlock-samsung-sim-network-unlock-pin.html" >sim network unlock pin <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> for a minimal price.</p><h2 id="Part-1-Honor-80-Pro-Straight-Screen-Edition-Unlock-Code"><a href="#Part-1-Honor-80-Pro-Straight-Screen-Edition-Unlock-Code" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Honor 80 Pro Straight Screen Edition Unlock Code"></a>Part 1: Honor 80 Pro Straight Screen Edition Unlock Code</h2><p>This is probably the easiest, no-fuss method to <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/unlock-android-screen/" >sim unlock <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> Honor 80 Pro Straight Screen Edition. Follow these steps carefully to successfully perform Honor 80 Pro Straight Screen Edition unlock code.</p><p>Do take note that this process may not work with your carrier. Therefore, always check if this is the right way to obtain the necessary code:</p><ul><li>1. Check the SIM lock status—you can do this by dialing <strong>*#*#7378423#*#*</strong>.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2016/08/14707989592943.jpg"                      alt="sony xperia unlock code"                ></p><ul><li>2.

The number beside <strong>Network</strong> indicates how many attempts you have to unlock the phone. If it says ‘7’ it means you have seven attempts; ‘0’ simply means it is hard locked and cannot be unlocked using this method.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2016/08/14707989597664.jpg"                      alt="unlock code sony xperia"                ></p><ul><li>4. Find the <strong>IMEI number</strong> by dialing <strong>*#06#</strong>. Jot it down as this will be your code.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2016/08/14707998453087.jpg"                      alt="sony unlock code"                ></p><ul><li>5.

Actually, it is the safest method among all three:</p><ol><li>Get a new SIM card from a new carrier.</li><li>Call your carrier’s customer service line and ask what are the requirements to qualify you to get your Honor 80 Pro Straight Screen Edition unlocked. If you have honored your contract, there should not be any problems. However, do ask your carrier if there are any additional requirements. Do note that there may be fees involved.</li><li>Once your customer service representative has determined if you have met all their requirements, they should give you the SIM network unlock PIN Honor 80 Pro Straight Screen Edition. Again, depending on your carrier, they might either give you the code over the phone, through email or via SMS. If you have the choice, always opt for email or SMS so that you are able to jot down the right number.</li><li>Once you have gotten the code, insert the new SIM card (from your new carrier). You will receive a prompt to enter your code. Make sure that you key in the right code—entering the wrong code will cause your phone to be locked (possibly forever).</li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2016/08/unlock-screen.jpg"                      alt="sony unlock screen"                ></p><h2 id="Part-4-Honor-80-Pro-Straight-Screen-Edition-Unlock-App-Software"><a href="#Part-4-Honor-80-Pro-Straight-Screen-Edition-Unlock-App-Software" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: Honor 80 Pro Straight Screen Edition Unlock App&#x2F;Software"></a>Part 4: Honor 80 Pro Straight Screen Edition Unlock App&#x2F;Software</h2><p>There are some of us out there who are just not confident with doing things ourselves or trusting our own carrier.</p><p>HOWEVER, if your first instinct is to head to Google Play to look for SIM unlock tools, heed these cautions. There are currently many apps that claim that they can unlock your phone but it is just a scam. You should also avoid torrent files available online.

You loved the Honor X9b device but your network provider does not have any plans that exactly suit your needs. To release your device from your current network’s clutches, you will need to unlock your phone.</p><p>There are three ways you can do it and this post will go through each method so that you can find one that you are most comfortable with. Do note that if your contract has ended with your network provider, this “How to unlock Honor X9b” post can be skipped as you can just ask them to unlock your phone or purchase a <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/unlock/unlock-samsung-sim-network-unlock-pin.html" >sim network unlock pin <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> for a minimal price.</p><h2 id="Part-1-Honor-X9b-Unlock-Code"><a href="#Part-1-Honor-X9b-Unlock-Code" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Honor X9b Unlock Code"></a>Part 1: Honor X9b Unlock Code</h2><p>This is probably the easiest, no-fuss method to <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/unlock-android-screen/" >sim unlock <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> Honor X9b. Follow these steps carefully to successfully perform Honor X9b unlock code.</p><p>Do take note that this process may not work with your carrier. Therefore, always check if this is the right way to obtain the necessary code:</p><ul><li>1. Check the SIM lock status—you can do this by dialing <strong>*#*#7378423#*#*</strong>.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2016/08/14707989592943.jpg"                      alt="sony xperia unlock code"                ></p><ul><li>2. Tap <strong>Service info</strong> then <strong>Sim lock</strong>.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2016/08/14707989592897.jpg"                      alt="unlock with sony xperia unlock code"                ></p><ul><li>3. The number beside <strong>Network</strong> indicates how many attempts you have to unlock the phone. If it says ‘7’ it means you have seven attempts; ‘0’ simply means it is hard locked and cannot be unlocked using this method.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2016/08/14707989597664.jpg"                      alt="unlock code sony xperia"                ></p><ul><li>4. Find the <strong>IMEI number</strong> by dialing <strong>*#06#</strong>. Jot it down as this will be your code.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2016/08/14707998453087.jpg"                      alt="sony unlock code"                ></p><ul><li>5. Insert your new SIM card and tap in the IMEI number when it asks you for SIM network unlock PIN.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2016/08/unlock-screen.jpg"                      alt="sony unlock screen"                ></p><p>If you have followed these steps to a tee, you should have unlocked your device.

Actually, it is the safest method among all three:</p><ol><li>Get a new SIM card from a new carrier.</li><li>Call your carrier’s customer service line and ask what are the requirements to qualify you to get your Honor X9b unlocked. If you have honored your contract, there should not be any problems. However, do ask your carrier if there are any additional requirements. Do note that there may be fees involved.</li><li>Once your customer service representative has determined if you have met all their requirements, they should give you the SIM network unlock PIN Honor X9b. Again, depending on your carrier, they might either give you the code over the phone, through email or via SMS. If you have the choice, always opt for email or SMS so that you are able to jot down the right number.</li><li>Once you have gotten the code, insert the new SIM card (from your new carrier). You will receive a prompt to enter your code. Make sure that you key in the right code—entering the wrong code will cause your phone to be locked (possibly forever).</li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2016/08/unlock-screen.jpg"                      alt="sony unlock screen"                ></p><h2 id="Part-4-Honor-X9b-Unlock-App-Software"><a href="#Part-4-Honor-X9b-Unlock-App-Software" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: Honor X9b Unlock App&#x2F;Software"></a>Part 4: Honor X9b Unlock App&#x2F;Software</h2><p>There are some of us out there who are just not confident with doing things ourselves or trusting our own carrier.</p><p>HOWEVER, if your first instinct is to head to Google Play to look for SIM unlock tools, heed these cautions. There are currently many apps that claim that they can unlock your phone but it is just a scam. You should also avoid torrent files available online.

Therefore, if you travel frequently around the world, having an unlocked Honor X9b would be beneficial. Using a local SIM card is much cheaper than paying for exorbitant roaming charges.</p><p>You can also benefit from an unlocked Honor X9b if you are the kind of person who likes to take advantage of current offers provided by your local carriers. Prepaid plans are always changing in terms of offering so having the flexibility of changing carriers and prepaid plans can help you save money in the long run.</p><h2 id="Part-6-The-downside-of-an-unlocked-Honor-X9b"><a href="#Part-6-The-downside-of-an-unlocked-Honor-X9b" class="headerlink" title="Part 6: The downside of an unlocked Honor X9b"></a>Part 6: The downside of an unlocked Honor X9b</h2><p>Are you thinking “Well, why can’t I just buy an unlocked Honor X9b in the first place?” right about now? Well, you can but think of the amount of money it will cost you.</p><p>For example, in Australia, an unlocked Honor X9b will cost around $499 from any Honor outlet but $0 for the Honor X9b device when you pair it with a 24-month postpaid plan. While this may look attractive now, you may be paying more for a locked Honor X9b in the long run.</p><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>Now that you know the three ways of unlocking your Honor X9b, all you need to do is find one that is most compatible with you.

This would cause problems if for instance you wanted to travel outside the country and want to switch to that country’s carrier for the duration of your stay. Or maybe you just want to switch carriers because you don’t like your current provider.</p><p>Whatever the reason, you should be able to unlock your device easily. But this has often proven difficult because of the fact that you need unlock codes. The problem is that many sites promise free unlocking codes for your device and many turn out to be fraudulent sites that use the word “free” in their advertising but actually require you to pay for the service. If you have been unsuccessfully searching for free unlocking codes for your device, look no further. This article compiles three of the best for Android and iPhone.</p><h2 id="Part-1-3-Ways-to-Find-Unlocking-Codes-for-Android-Devices"><a href="#Part-1-3-Ways-to-Find-Unlocking-Codes-for-Android-Devices" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: 3 Ways to Find Unlocking Codes for Android Devices"></a>Part 1: 3 Ways to Find Unlocking Codes for Android Devices</h2><h3 id="1-Unlock-it-Free"><a href="#1-Unlock-it-Free" class="headerlink" title="1.

Your SIM locks itself after three to five wrong inputs, on average. Although it might be annoying, doing these guards against unauthorized access to your phone and personal data. If your cell phone is lost or stolen, PUK blocked will prevent prospective hackers from making calls.</p><p>Your mobile phone display can say “PIN blocked” or “Enter PUK code.” PUK stands for PIN Unblocking Key in the PUK code. The PUK code is seldom given to you when you receive your membership in the US.

Phones are our life source in this global age, it’s our tether to reality, to the world! But if you have a carrier locked phone, then that connection is basically under contract by an external agency! You can’t change your networks, there are limitations on how you use your phone, and when you have to travel abroad you have no option other than paying the roaming charges. If you, say, have an iPhone 5c and have these frustrations, it’s likely you’re already wondering how to unlock the iPhone 5c.</p><p>Chances are that if you’ve had a carrier locked phone for a while, you might have already forgotten what cellular freedom feels like. But we’re here to remind you. All you have to do is break that carrier-lock, and you’re good to go. However, you should be careful when doing so, cause if you try using a jailbreaking technique, it could have major repercussions. So we’re here to give you some valuable advice about how to unlock iPhone 5, iPhone 5c, or even Android phones.</p><h2 id="Part-1-Unlock-SIM-Card-on-Honor-Magic-V2-via-jailbreak"><a href="#Part-1-Unlock-SIM-Card-on-Honor-Magic-V2-via-jailbreak" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Unlock SIM Card on Honor Magic V2 via jailbreak"></a>Part 1: Unlock SIM Card on Honor Magic V2 via jailbreak</h2><p>Before we get into telling you how to unlock iPhone 5, or the SIM Card on iPhone or Android, we should first tell you what Jailbreaking is. You might have heard of this term before, and I’m sure it sounded ominous to you. Jailbreak? It sounds awfully close to ‘Prison break.’ Well, considering the carrier lock is sort of like a prison for your cell, it is an accurate terminology. But Jailbreak isn’t just about breaking the carrier lock. That might happen as a by-product, but the real purpose is to break free of the software restrictions which are generally applied to Apple devices. This might seem like a good option because, well, who doesn’t want to break free of all of Apple’s restrictions? But that always comes at several heavy risks.</p><h3 id="Threats-of-unlocking-SIM-via-Jailbreak"><a href="#Threats-of-unlocking-SIM-via-Jailbreak" class="headerlink" title="Threats of unlocking SIM via Jailbreak"></a>Threats of unlocking SIM via Jailbreak</h3><h4 id="1-Not-Permanent"><a href="#1-Not-Permanent" class="headerlink" title="1. Not Permanent"></a>1. Not Permanent</h4><p>This has got to be one of the biggest reasons for not jailbreaking your phone. It is not at all permanent! In fact, the moment you update your system, your jailbreak is lost and if you’ve started using a different SIM it will no longer function, and you’re gonna have to go back to using that Carrier you tried so hard to escape from! It’s really not worth the effort. Of course, you could stop updating altogether, but then that will bring us to…</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2016/10/14771444107532.jpg"                      alt="Unlock SIM Card on iPhone and Android via jailbreak"                ></p><h4 id="2-Risky"><a href="#2-Risky" class="headerlink" title="2. Risky"></a>2. Risky</h4><p>If you don’t update your iOS, or Mac or iPad or any device at all, in this day and age, you’re basically just asking to be hacked. That is not to excuse those who do the hacking and plant malware on your system, but if you leave your front door open in a shitty neighborhood, well then you only have yourself to blame once you get robbed!</p><h4 id="3-Warranty"><a href="#3-Warranty" class="headerlink" title="3. Warranty"></a>3. Warranty</h4><p>Jailbreaking has now become kind-of-legal, in a very tenuous sense, but that doesn’t mean Apple wholeheartedly welcomes jailbreaking. If you do so, you will never again be able to avail of the warranty on your phone. And with the kind of major bucks you have to shell out for those iPhones, you best keep that warranty intact.</p><h4 id="4-Lack-of-Apps"><a href="#4-Lack-of-Apps" class="headerlink" title="4. Lack of Apps"></a>4. Lack of Apps</h4><p>Many top-notch and crucial app companies and organizations simply refuse to make their applications usable in jailbreak phones, as they are extremely risky and prone to hacking. As a result, you would have to rely on a bunch of non-professional apps made by amateurs, which is more likely to put your phone in harm’s way.</p><h4 id="5-Bricking"><a href="#5-Bricking" class="headerlink" title="5. Bricking"></a>5. Bricking</h4><p>This basically means your whole system may crash and stop functioning. As a result, you’re gonna’ have to restore the whole thing and try to salvage whatever information you can. Now those who do jailbreak regularly will give you all kinds of excuses like it happens only rarely or that you can retrieve your data simply from the cloud, et al. But do you really want to divest all your time and energy trying to fight off malware, backing up all your data, etc, especially when there is a much more convenient option just around the corner?</p><p>Didn’t think so.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2136622/26400" target="_top" id="2136622">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2136622" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/i/5597632/2136622/26400"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-unlock-SIM-Card-on-iPhone-without-jailbreak-Bonus"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-unlock-SIM-Card-on-iPhone-without-jailbreak-Bonus" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to unlock SIM Card on iPhone without jailbreak[Bonus]"></a>Part 2: How to unlock SIM Card on iPhone without jailbreak[Bonus]</h2><p>As mentioned above, unlocking by jailbreaking is risky and only temporary.

Unlock It Now</h2><p>Carriers provide cellular connections so you can access the Internet, send text messages, and make phone calls without Wi-Fi. You cannot escape the carriers once you begin using a cell phone.</p><p>Customers can purchase a new handset via carriers or the mobile phone market. You may need an unlocked phone if you wish to use a different carrier’s service on your smartphone. However, if you want a gadget linked to a specific SIM card, you may buy one from the carriers for a reduced price.</p><h2 id="Part-1-What-Does-It-Mean-If-Your-Honor-Magic-V2-Asks-for-SIM-Network-PIN"><a href="#Part-1-What-Does-It-Mean-If-Your-Honor-Magic-V2-Asks-for-SIM-Network-PIN" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What Does It Mean If Your Honor Magic V2 Asks for SIM Network PIN?"></a>Part 1: What Does It Mean If Your Honor Magic V2 Asks for SIM Network PIN?</h2><p>When your phone prompts you to enter a SIM Network Unlock PIN, it means that your device is currently locked to a specific mobile network carrier, and it can only be used with SIM cards from that carrier. This locking mechanism is usually put in place by the carrier or the phone manufacturer to ensure that you continue to use their services, typically for the duration of a contract. As a result, your phone cannot be freely used with SIM cards from other carriers until it’s unlocked using the correct PIN or code.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/11/fix-network-locked-simcard-inserted-01.jpg"                      alt="sim locked"                ></p><h2 id="Part-2-Why-Does-Your-Honor-Magic-V2-Say-Invalid-SIM-Card-–-Network-Locked-SIM-Card-Inserted"><a href="#Part-2-Why-Does-Your-Honor-Magic-V2-Say-Invalid-SIM-Card-–-Network-Locked-SIM-Card-Inserted" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Why Does Your Honor Magic V2 Say Invalid SIM Card – Network Locked SIM Card Inserted?"></a>Part 2: Why Does Your Honor Magic V2 Say Invalid SIM Card – Network Locked SIM Card Inserted?</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/11/fix-network-locked-simcard-inserted-2.jpg"                      alt="remove network lock"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2082520/7443" target="_top" id="2082520">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2082520" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2082520/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><strong>System Errors</strong></p><p>Since SIM locking is a smartphone restriction implemented to stop it from being used on other networks, Android system errors can cause network-locked SIM cards. Resetting these errors can help unlock your <strong>network locked SIM card inserted</strong> device. Service providers decided to provide a formal SIM unlocking option as a result.</p><p>Because of this, any locked SIM may be readily unlocked, and once a device opens, it can work like a conventional mobile phone and with any SIM card of the user’s choosing.</p><p><strong>Carrier Lock</strong></p><p>The consumer must stick with the same service provider for a specific time after purchasing the bundled device and data pack. This is called a carrier lock on the Honor Magic V2 device and is one of the most common errors in <strong>network locked SIM card inserted</strong> devices. During that time, the Honor Magic V2 device will be network- or SIM-locked, prohibiting the user from changing service providers.</p><p>The user cannot change the SIM. The service provider will offer the SIM Unlock code needed to unlock the handset when the contract expires. The gadget can be used with any other SIM card and exported to another country without problems when the network lock has been removed.</p><p><strong>Region Lock</strong></p><p>Apple and AT&amp;T initially worked together to implement the SIM lock and the SIM locked devices. The original purpose was to force the user to continue using the same service provider in a specific area or time.</p><p>However, some telecom service providers sell the handsets with select data plans as bundled plans in collaboration with the Honor Magic V2 device manufacturers. As a result, the handset will cost less than it would otherwise. Sometimes, these offers are particular to a specific region, called a carrier lock.</p><p><strong>Firmware Problems</strong></p><p>Sometimes, the Honor Magic V2 device manufacturers release many versions of the same firmware for different geographical locations.</p><p>As a result, it may be possible that the user may face contradictions in the agreement of device firmware and the network-locked SIM card that was supposed to be used on the Honor Magic V2 device. Due to firmware problems, the users may also face a network-locked SIM card-inserted device.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/11/fix-network-locked-simcard-inserted-03.png"                      alt="unlock sim card"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1902289/19272" target="_top" id="1902289">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1902289" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1902289/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-3-How-to-Unlock-Network-Locked-SIM-Card-Inserted"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-Unlock-Network-Locked-SIM-Card-Inserted" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How to Unlock Network Locked SIM Card Inserted?"></a>Part 3: How to Unlock Network Locked SIM Card Inserted?</h2><p>Unlocking a network-locked SIM card may seem like a complex task.

This guarantees that the Honor Magic V2 device is only being used with the original SIM card for each provider. This locking also has a lot of drawbacks because it is incompatible with any other SIM card.</p><ol><li>The phone cannot be used with other SIM cards if the SIM lock is enabled. Customers must therefore adhere to the current plan as is.</li><li>Since nobody wants to purchase a locked phone, it is hard for someone to sell or gift the mobile.</li><li>Traveling abroad with a SIM-locked phone could provide some challenges because you won’t be able to use a local SIM card on the phone while you’re there.</li></ol><p>All the problems can be fixed, and the SIM works in any nation with the removed SIM lock.</p><h3 id="Conclusion-1"><a href="#Conclusion-1" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h3><p>Any of the methods above can work to get around the prohibition against using other SIM cards with your Android handset. The best thing about using Dr.Fone-Screen Unlock is that you don’t need unlocking codes to complete the tasks.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins><br><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://eaxpv-info.techidaily.com/updated-harnessing-the-power-of-targeted-video-appeal-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Harnessing the Power of Targeted Video Appeal for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-tips.techidaily.com/ensure-that-the-tone-remains-supportive-and-encouraging-without-diminishing-any-treatment-options-value/"><u>Ensure that the Tone Remains Supportive and Encouraging without Diminishing Any Treatment Options' Value</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tech-recovery.techidaily.com/google-maps-mastery-tracking-down-electric-car-chargers-with-ease/"><u>Google Maps Mastery: Tracking Down Electric Car Chargers With Ease</u></a></li><li><a href="https://sim-unlock.techidaily.com/how-to-change-your-sim-pin-code-on-your-oppo-a58-4g-phone-by-drfone-android/"><u>How To Change Your SIM PIN Code on Your Oppo A58 4G Phone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://sim-unlock.techidaily.com/in-2024-android-unlock-code-sim-unlock-your-honor-70-lite-5g-phone-and-remove-locked-screen-by-drfone-android/"><u>In 2024, Android Unlock Code Sim Unlock Your Honor 70 Lite 5G Phone and Remove Locked Screen</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-techniques.techidaily.com/in-2024-expert-tips-for-applying-apple-music-to-your-videos/"><u>In 2024, Expert Tips for Applying Apple Music to Your Videos</u></a></li><li><a href="https://sim-unlock.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-to-unlock-sim-card-on-iphone-15-pro-max-online-without-jailbreak-by-drfone-ios/"><u>In 2024, How to Unlock SIM Card on iPhone 15 Pro Max online without jailbreak</u></a></li><li><a href="https://techno-recovery.techidaily.com/mastering-snapchat-expressions-understanding-emoji-meanings-inside-out/"><u>Mastering Snapchat Expressions: Understanding Emoji Meanings Inside Out</u></a></li><li><a href="https://sim-unlock.techidaily.com/sim-unlock-motorola-phones-without-code-2-ways-to-remove-android-sim-lock-by-drfone-android/"><u>Sim Unlock Motorola Phones without Code 2 Ways to Remove Android Sim Lock</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

Some of these benefits are:</p><ul><li><strong>1. Freedom to choose your carrier</strong></li></ul><p>When your phone is carrier locked, you are limited to using only the carrier that the phone is locked to. This can be a problem if you travel frequently or want to switch to a different carrier. By unlocking your phone’s SIM card, you will be able to use any carrier’s SIM card, giving you the freedom to choose the carrier that best suits your needs.</p><ul><li><strong>2. Cost savings</strong></li></ul><p>By unlocking your phone’s SIM card, you can save money on roaming charges when traveling. Instead of paying expensive roaming charges, you can simply purchase a local SIM card and use it in your unlocked phone. This can save you a lot of money in the long run.</p><ul><li><strong>3. Resale value</strong></li></ul><p>An unlocked phone has a higher resale value than a carrier-locked phone. This is because an unlocked phone can be used with any carrier’s SIM card, making it more attractive to buyers.</p><ul><li><strong>4. No need to buy a new phone</strong></li></ul><p>If you want to switch to a different carrier, you may be tempted to buy a new phone that is compatible with that carrier. However, by unlocking your phone’s SIM card, you can use your existing phone with any carrier’s SIM card, saving you the cost of buying a new phone.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2144309/7443" target="_top" id="2144309">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2144309" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2144309/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-4-4-Android-SIM-Unlock-Code-Generators-Reviews"><a href="#Part-4-4-Android-SIM-Unlock-Code-Generators-Reviews" class="headerlink" title="Part 4. 4 Android SIM Unlock Code Generators Reviews"></a>Part 4. 4 Android SIM Unlock Code Generators Reviews</h2><p>There are several Android SIM unlock code generator software available on the internet.

Well, you can but think of the amount of money it will cost you.</p><p>For example, in Australia, an unlocked Poco F5 Pro 5G will cost around $499 from any Poco outlet but $0 for the Poco F5 Pro 5G device when you pair it with a 24-month postpaid plan. While this may look attractive now, you may be paying more for a locked Poco F5 Pro 5G in the long run.</p><h2 id="Conclusion-1"><a href="#Conclusion-1" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>Now that you know the three ways of unlocking your Poco F5 Pro 5G, all you need to do is find one that is most compatible with you.

Here are some of them:</p><p><strong>Advantages</strong></p><ol><li>Make your Android untraceable. By constantly changing your IMEI, you will throw off the tracks of people using it to stalk you!</li><li>Fix any invalid IMEI-related issues such as lost or invalid IMEI numbers. Once you change your IMEI, your Android device with the same benefits and features.</li><li>Obtaining a completely new device ID.</li><li>Changing the IMEI number to one that indicates it is a newer model, you will be able to enjoy new OS updates by resetting, repairing, and updating your Android device.</li><li>Have you ever yearned for that cheap BlackBerry plan your network carrier keeps on promoting? The 15-digit IMEI indicates the origin and model of your device. Therefore, by changing your Android’s IMEI number to that of a BlackBerry’s, you will be able to subscribe to a cheaper mobile plan.</li></ol><p><strong>Disadvantages</strong></p><ol><li>Before we begin, we need to make it clear that the process of changing IMEI without root can be illegal in some countries. We advise you to check the laws and regulations in your country before attempting to change your device’s IMEI number. As far as we know, it is legal in Africa and Asia, and illegal in Europe.</li><li>The IMEI number is hardcoded into your device. Therefore, changing your device’s IMEI number may void your device warranty and cause other issues such as network problems and software instability.</li><li>Legally, you have forfeited your ownership of your mobile device. When you purchase your device, the seller will jot down the original IMEI number on your receipt. So if you changed your IMEI and lost it, you may not be able to claim it. This is because authorities cannot see if it is truly yours. After all, the IMEI numbers no longer correlate with each other.</li></ol><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Find-the-IMEI-on-an-Android-5-Ways"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Find-the-IMEI-on-an-Android-5-Ways" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Find the IMEI on an Android?

But that’s not really true. There are few ways that could help alleviate this problem or which could come as a help in such circumstances when the Smartphone is carrier locked. This problem often requires help from the carrier or network and can be easily sorted on doing so.</p><p>Now, having talked about SIM lock or carrier lock, it is also important to know whether a device is SIM locked or not, because not all phones are SIM locked. So, to find out whether your phone is network locked, you can check the documentation of the Honor Magic Vs 2 device that you received while purchasing. If the phone is unlocked, the “unlocked word would certainly appear on the receipt. To be sure and precise whether the phone is SIM locked, the best thing that can be done is to contact the carrier and check if the phone is carrier locked. Before that, you can even check the phone yourself by placing a different SIM in the phone and check whether it works. If the same issue persists even with different SIMs, then there is a good chance that the phone is carrier locked. Now that we know how to check if the phone is SIM locked, it is imperative to know how to unlock Android phone for different carrier. It is not that difficult a task to unlock carrier locked phones and there are a few methods to unlock such locked phones.</p><h2 id="Part-1-Asking-the-Carrier-to-Unlock"><a href="#Part-1-Asking-the-Carrier-to-Unlock" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Asking the Carrier to Unlock"></a>Part 1: Asking the Carrier to Unlock</h2><p>One of the best options is getting in touch with the carrier and asking them to unlock the SIM locked phone. For that to happen, it is important to first know whether the phone is SIM locked and then whether the phone can be unlocked and if you are eligible to unlock the phone. There is an eligibility clause in contract for Smartphones bought on contract and if a specific time period is not up yet, then a termination fee is required to be paid by the user to break the contract in order to be able to use any SIM on the Honor Magic Vs 2 device after getting the unlock code.</p><p><strong><em>Pros</em></strong></p><p>• This is the best way to unlock carrier locked devices.</p><p>• This is legal and everything happens based on the clause mentioned in the contract.</p><p><strong>_Cons<br>_</strong></p><p>• Sometimes, even the network providers or carrier refuse to unlock Smartphone</p><p>• There is a certain time period which if not over yet, unlocking the phone would require termination fee.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Professional-Reputable-Smartphone-Unlock-Service"><a href="#Part-2-Professional-Reputable-Smartphone-Unlock-Service" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Professional Reputable Smartphone Unlock Service"></a>Part 2: Professional Reputable Smartphone Unlock Service</h2><p>If you have tried out contacting the carrier and there is no way the carrier is unlocking your phone, you can opt for professional unlock service which could be of help. But finding such a professional service is not an easy task. There are some sites and service providers which require the IMEI number of the phone to create unlock codes. IMEI number of the phone is given to the professional SIM unlock service post which, they generate a special character combination which can be used to get the cell phone out of network restrictions. So, the phone can be unlocked remotely by using the special remote unlock codes.</p><p>Sometimes, the professional Smartphone service providers even ask for the phone to be sent to them to get the phone unlocked.</p><p><strong><em>Pros</em></strong></p><p>• This method could be opted as a last resort if there is no help from the carrier.</p><p>• Professional and reputable Smartphone unlock service providers tend to serve the purpose as they are specialized in this task.</p><p>• There are not many obligations involved.</p><p><strong>_Cons<br>_</strong></p><p>• This might attract legal actions against the user.</p><p>• It is very difficult to find such professional Smartphone unlock service providers.</p><p>• Reliability on such service providers is also another factor which requires attention.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Unlock-Android-to-Use-Any-SIM-via-Doctor-SIM"><a href="#Part-3-Unlock-Android-to-Use-Any-SIM-via-Doctor-SIM" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Unlock Android to Use Any SIM via Doctor SIM"></a>Part 3: Unlock Android to Use Any SIM via Doctor SIM</h2><p>Compared to connecting with your network provider, choosing an unlocking software may be a quicker and easier way. <a class="link"   href="https://www.doctorsim.com/gb-en/?scp" >Doctor SIM <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> could be a good option.

Your SIM locks itself after three to five wrong inputs, on average. Although it might be annoying, doing these guards against unauthorized access to your phone and personal data. If your cell phone is lost or stolen, PUK blocked will prevent prospective hackers from making calls.</p><p>Your mobile phone display can say “PIN blocked” or “Enter PUK code.” PUK stands for PIN Unblocking Key in the PUK code. The PUK code is seldom given to you when you receive your membership in the US. Contact Your Realme C53 provider’s customer support if you don’t know your PUK code.</p><h2 id="Part-1-Why-Was-My-Sim-Card-Blocked"><a href="#Part-1-Why-Was-My-Sim-Card-Blocked" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Why Was My Sim Card Blocked?"></a>Part 1: Why Was My Sim Card Blocked?</h2><h3 id="1-3-times-incorrect-Pin-entered"><a href="#1-3-times-incorrect-Pin-entered" class="headerlink" title="1. 3 times incorrect Pin entered"></a>1. 3 times incorrect Pin entered</h3><p>Sometimes when you forget your pin and keep on entering the wrong one, you can get PUK Blocked.

This 4-digit code protects your phone number from unauthorized calls, texts, and data use. It’s essential to change the default PIN to one that’s both memorable for you and difficult for others to guess.</p><p>So, <strong>how to change the PIN on an Android phone</strong>’s SIM card?

Unlike the PIN you use to unlock your phone, the SIM PIN code is a separate layer of security. If someone tries to use your SIM card in another phone without the correct PIN, they won’t be able to access your network or data.</p><p>Here are more reasons why <strong>changing the PIN code of a SIM card</strong> is a smart move:</p><ul><li>Default PINs are easy to guess</li></ul><p>Most carriers use generic PINs like “1234” or “0000”. Change it to something unique and harder to crack.</p><ul><li>Protects data in case of loss or theft</li></ul><p>If you lose your phone or it gets stolen, a strong PIN code hinders the thief’s ability to make calls, send messages, or access your data stored on the SIM. It buys you time to report the loss and block your SIM card before they can do any damage.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/02/how-to-change-pin-on-android-phone-02.jpg"                      alt="sim card locked"                ></p><ul><li>Prevents accidental PIN lockouts</li></ul><p>Using a memorable PIN minimizes the risk of accidentally locking yourself out of your SIM card.</p><ul><li>Peace of mind</li></ul><p>It is crucial if you store sensitive info on your SIM or use your phone for work. Knowing about this extra safeguard is reassuring, ensuring your data stays protected.</p><p><strong>Remember:</strong></p><p>Choose a PIN code for your SIM that’s easy for you to remember but challenging for others to guess. Avoid using birthdays, anniversaries, or other easily identifiable information. By taking a few minutes to <strong>change the PIN code of the SIM card</strong>, you’ll gain a significant security advantage for your new phone and data.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-To-Change-Pin-on-Android-Phone-SIM-Cards"><a href="#Part-2-How-To-Change-Pin-on-Android-Phone-SIM-Cards" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How To Change Pin on Android Phone SIM Cards?"></a>Part 2: How To Change Pin on Android Phone SIM Cards?</h2><p>Keeping your SIM card secure is crucial for protecting your data and privacy. Thankfully, Android allows you to easily change your SIM card PIN to a more personal and memorable code. But before you begin:</p><ul><li>Contact your network carrier to get your PUK code if you already have it. You’ll need this if you enter the wrong PIN three times and lock your SIM card.</li><li>Remember the temporary default PIN: Most SIM cards have a default PIN, often 1234 or 0123. If you haven’t changed it, this is the PIN you’ll use initially.</li></ul><p><strong>Note:</strong></p><p>Entering the wrong PIN three times will lock your SIM card. You’ll need your network carrier’s PUK code to unlock it. Use it cautiously, as exceeding the maximum number of attempts will permanently block your SIM card. So, it’s best to memorize your PIN or store it securely to avoid relying on the PUK altogether.</p><p>Steps To Change Your SIM PIN</p><p>Here’s <strong>how to find and manage the SIM PIN code on Android</strong>:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Navigate to your phone’s <strong>Settings</strong> app. Next, look for the <strong>Security and privacy</strong> or <strong>Lock screen and security</strong> (or other similar option) depending on your device’s model.</li><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Scroll down and tap on <strong>More security settings</strong> or <strong>Other security settings</strong>.</li><li><strong>Step 3:</strong> Tap <strong>SIM card security</strong> or <strong>Set up SIM card lock</strong> (or something similar).</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/02/how-to-change-pin-on-android-phone-03.jpg"                      alt="sim card security in settings"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Step 4:</strong> If you have multiple SIMs, select the one you want to change the PIN code.</li><li><strong>Step 5:</strong> Tap <strong>Change SIM PIN</strong>.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/02/how-to-change-pin-on-android-phone-04.jpg"                      alt="change sim pin code on android"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Step 6:</strong> Input your current SIM card PIN code and tap <strong>OK</strong>.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/02/how-to-change-pin-on-android-phone-05.jpg"                      alt="enter old sim pin"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2047361/19272" target="_top" id="2047361">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2047361" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2047361/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><ul><li><strong>Step 7:</strong> Enter your desired new PIN code and tap <strong>OK</strong>.</li><li><strong>Step 8:</strong> Re-enter your new SIM card PIN code and tap <strong>OK</strong> to confirm.</li></ul><p>Success!

This would cause problems if for instance you wanted to travel outside the country and want to switch to that country’s carrier for the duration of your stay. Or maybe you just want to switch carriers because you don’t like your current provider.</p><p>Whatever the reason, you should be able to unlock your device easily. But this has often proven difficult because of the fact that you need unlock codes. The problem is that many sites promise free unlocking codes for your device and many turn out to be fraudulent sites that use the word “free” in their advertising but actually require you to pay for the service. If you have been unsuccessfully searching for free unlocking codes for your device, look no further. This article compiles three of the best for Android and iPhone.</p><h2 id="Part-1-3-Ways-to-Find-Unlocking-Codes-for-Android-Devices"><a href="#Part-1-3-Ways-to-Find-Unlocking-Codes-for-Android-Devices" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: 3 Ways to Find Unlocking Codes for Android Devices"></a>Part 1: 3 Ways to Find Unlocking Codes for Android Devices</h2><h3 id="1-Unlock-it-Free"><a href="#1-Unlock-it-Free" class="headerlink" title="1.

This locking mechanism is usually put in place by the carrier or the phone manufacturer to ensure that you continue to use their services, typically for the duration of a contract. As a result, your phone cannot be freely used with SIM cards from other carriers until it’s unlocked using the correct PIN or code.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/11/fix-network-locked-simcard-inserted-01.jpg"                      alt="sim locked"                ></p><h2 id="Part-2-Why-Does-Your-Honor-Magic5-Ultimate-Say-Invalid-SIM-Card-–-Network-Locked-SIM-Card-Inserted"><a href="#Part-2-Why-Does-Your-Honor-Magic5-Ultimate-Say-Invalid-SIM-Card-–-Network-Locked-SIM-Card-Inserted" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Why Does Your Honor Magic5 Ultimate Say Invalid SIM Card – Network Locked SIM Card Inserted?"></a>Part 2: Why Does Your Honor Magic5 Ultimate Say Invalid SIM Card – Network Locked SIM Card Inserted?</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/11/fix-network-locked-simcard-inserted-2.jpg"                      alt="remove network lock"                ></p><p><strong>System Errors</strong></p><p>Since SIM locking is a smartphone restriction implemented to stop it from being used on other networks, Android system errors can cause network-locked SIM cards. Resetting these errors can help unlock your <strong>network locked SIM card inserted</strong> device. Service providers decided to provide a formal SIM unlocking option as a result.</p><p>Because of this, any locked SIM may be readily unlocked, and once a device opens, it can work like a conventional mobile phone and with any SIM card of the user’s choosing.</p><p><strong>Carrier Lock</strong></p><p>The consumer must stick with the same service provider for a specific time after purchasing the bundled device and data pack. This is called a carrier lock on the Honor Magic5 Ultimate device and is one of the most common errors in <strong>network locked SIM card inserted</strong> devices. During that time, the Honor Magic5 Ultimate device will be network- or SIM-locked, prohibiting the user from changing service providers.</p><p>The user cannot change the SIM. The service provider will offer the SIM Unlock code needed to unlock the handset when the contract expires. The gadget can be used with any other SIM card and exported to another country without problems when the network lock has been removed.</p><p><strong>Region Lock</strong></p><p>Apple and AT&amp;T initially worked together to implement the SIM lock and the SIM locked devices. The original purpose was to force the user to continue using the same service provider in a specific area or time.</p><p>However, some telecom service providers sell the handsets with select data plans as bundled plans in collaboration with the Honor Magic5 Ultimate device manufacturers. As a result, the handset will cost less than it would otherwise. Sometimes, these offers are particular to a specific region, called a carrier lock.</p><p><strong>Firmware Problems</strong></p><p>Sometimes, the Honor Magic5 Ultimate device manufacturers release many versions of the same firmware for different geographical locations.</p><p>As a result, it may be possible that the user may face contradictions in the agreement of device firmware and the network-locked SIM card that was supposed to be used on the Honor Magic5 Ultimate device. Due to firmware problems, the users may also face a network-locked SIM card-inserted device.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/11/fix-network-locked-simcard-inserted-03.png"                      alt="unlock sim card"                ></p><h2 id="Part-3-How-to-Unlock-Network-Locked-SIM-Card-Inserted"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-Unlock-Network-Locked-SIM-Card-Inserted" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How to Unlock Network Locked SIM Card Inserted?"></a>Part 3: How to Unlock Network Locked SIM Card Inserted?</h2><p>Unlocking a network-locked SIM card may seem like a complex task.

Launch the application and select the “Screen Unlock” tab from the list on the homepage.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/drfone-home.png"                      alt="homepage"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2068433/7443" target="_top" id="2068433">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2068433" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2068433/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><ul><li>Now, click on the “Remove SIM Locked” tab on the next page.

You can learn about the jailbreak process via the guide, or watching the video provided by Dr.Fone to jailbreak your iPhone is also feasible. The process is compatible with devices running iOS 12 to iOS 14.8.1.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/remove-iphone-sim-4.png"                      alt="jailbreak instructions"                ></p><ul><li>Now, you have to complete three tasks on your iPhone. First, put the SIM card out of your device. Open “Settings” and tap on the “WIFI” option. Tap on the blue exclamation mark next to all the connected networks and select “Forget This Network.” Now, switch off the “WIFI” and insert the locked SIM card in your iPhone. Click on the “Continue” option on your computer.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/remove-iphone-sim-5.png"                      alt="insert sim card"                ></p><ul><li>After that, Dr.Fone will automatically start the SIM unlocking process.

This guarantees that the Honor Magic5 Ultimate device is only being used with the original SIM card for each provider. This locking also has a lot of drawbacks because it is incompatible with any other SIM card.</p><ol><li>The phone cannot be used with other SIM cards if the SIM lock is enabled. Customers must therefore adhere to the current plan as is.</li><li>Since nobody wants to purchase a locked phone, it is hard for someone to sell or gift the mobile.</li><li>Traveling abroad with a SIM-locked phone could provide some challenges because you won’t be able to use a local SIM card on the phone while you’re there.</li></ol><p>All the problems can be fixed, and the SIM works in any nation with the removed SIM lock.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1997657/19272" target="_top" id="1997657">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1997657" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1997657/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h3><p>Any of the methods above can work to get around the prohibition against using other SIM cards with your Android handset.

Phones are our life source in this global age, it’s our tether to reality, to the world! But if you have a carrier locked phone, then that connection is basically under contract by an external agency! You can’t change your networks, there are limitations on how you use your phone, and when you have to travel abroad you have no option other than paying the roaming charges. If you, say, have an iPhone 5c and have these frustrations, it’s likely you’re already wondering how to unlock the iPhone 5c.</p><p>Chances are that if you’ve had a carrier locked phone for a while, you might have already forgotten what cellular freedom feels like. But we’re here to remind you. All you have to do is break that carrier-lock, and you’re good to go. However, you should be careful when doing so, cause if you try using a jailbreaking technique, it could have major repercussions. So we’re here to give you some valuable advice about how to unlock iPhone 5, iPhone 5c, or even Android phones.</p><h2 id="Part-1-Unlock-SIM-Card-on-Infinix-Zero-5G-2023-Turbo-via-jailbreak"><a href="#Part-1-Unlock-SIM-Card-on-Infinix-Zero-5G-2023-Turbo-via-jailbreak" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Unlock SIM Card on Infinix Zero 5G 2023 Turbo via jailbreak"></a>Part 1: Unlock SIM Card on Infinix Zero 5G 2023 Turbo via jailbreak</h2><p>Before we get into telling you how to unlock iPhone 5, or the SIM Card on iPhone or Android, we should first tell you what Jailbreaking is. You might have heard of this term before, and I’m sure it sounded ominous to you. Jailbreak? It sounds awfully close to ‘Prison break.’ Well, considering the carrier lock is sort of like a prison for your cell, it is an accurate terminology. But Jailbreak isn’t just about breaking the carrier lock. That might happen as a by-product, but the real purpose is to break free of the software restrictions which are generally applied to Apple devices. This might seem like a good option because, well, who doesn’t want to break free of all of Apple’s restrictions? But that always comes at several heavy risks.</p><h3 id="Threats-of-unlocking-SIM-via-Jailbreak"><a href="#Threats-of-unlocking-SIM-via-Jailbreak" class="headerlink" title="Threats of unlocking SIM via Jailbreak"></a>Threats of unlocking SIM via Jailbreak</h3><h4 id="1-Not-Permanent"><a href="#1-Not-Permanent" class="headerlink" title="1. Not Permanent"></a>1. Not Permanent</h4><p>This has got to be one of the biggest reasons for not jailbreaking your phone. It is not at all permanent! In fact, the moment you update your system, your jailbreak is lost and if you’ve started using a different SIM it will no longer function, and you’re gonna have to go back to using that Carrier you tried so hard to escape from! It’s really not worth the effort. Of course, you could stop updating altogether, but then that will bring us to…</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2016/10/14771444107532.jpg"                      alt="Unlock SIM Card on iPhone and Android via jailbreak"                ></p><h4 id="2-Risky"><a href="#2-Risky" class="headerlink" title="2. Risky"></a>2. Risky</h4><p>If you don’t update your iOS, or Mac or iPad or any device at all, in this day and age, you’re basically just asking to be hacked. That is not to excuse those who do the hacking and plant malware on your system, but if you leave your front door open in a shitty neighborhood, well then you only have yourself to blame once you get robbed!</p><h4 id="3-Warranty"><a href="#3-Warranty" class="headerlink" title="3. Warranty"></a>3. Warranty</h4><p>Jailbreaking has now become kind-of-legal, in a very tenuous sense, but that doesn’t mean Apple wholeheartedly welcomes jailbreaking. If you do so, you will never again be able to avail of the warranty on your phone. And with the kind of major bucks you have to shell out for those iPhones, you best keep that warranty intact.</p><h4 id="4-Lack-of-Apps"><a href="#4-Lack-of-Apps" class="headerlink" title="4. Lack of Apps"></a>4. Lack of Apps</h4><p>Many top-notch and crucial app companies and organizations simply refuse to make their applications usable in jailbreak phones, as they are extremely risky and prone to hacking. As a result, you would have to rely on a bunch of non-professional apps made by amateurs, which is more likely to put your phone in harm’s way.</p><h4 id="5-Bricking"><a href="#5-Bricking" class="headerlink" title="5. Bricking"></a>5. Bricking</h4><p>This basically means your whole system may crash and stop functioning. As a result, you’re gonna’ have to restore the whole thing and try to salvage whatever information you can. Now those who do jailbreak regularly will give you all kinds of excuses like it happens only rarely or that you can retrieve your data simply from the cloud, et al. But do you really want to divest all your time and energy trying to fight off malware, backing up all your data, etc, especially when there is a much more convenient option just around the corner?</p><p>Didn’t think so.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-unlock-SIM-Card-on-iPhone-without-jailbreak-Bonus"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-unlock-SIM-Card-on-iPhone-without-jailbreak-Bonus" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to unlock SIM Card on iPhone without jailbreak[Bonus]"></a>Part 2: How to unlock SIM Card on iPhone without jailbreak[Bonus]</h2><p>As mentioned above, unlocking by jailbreaking is risky and only temporary.

But this has often proven difficult because of the fact that you need unlock codes.

But your phone pops up with a request for a PIN code to unlock it. What’s that all about, and what do you enter? There are two main reasons why your phone might be asking for a SIM PIN or unlock code:</p><p>SIM Network Lock</p><p>The SIM Network Lock is a restriction placed by your phone’s original network provider, locking it to their network. It means you can only use the Honor Play 8T device with SIM cards from that specific carrier. Carriers use this to ensure that the phones they sell work only with their service. When you buy a subsidized phone, they want to ensure you stick around for the contract duration.</p><p>If you insert a SIM card from a different carrier, your phone will ask for a <strong>SIM Network Unlock PIN</strong> or Network Unlock Code (NUC). You’ll learn more about it in the upcoming sections of this article.</p><p>SIM Card Lock</p><p>SIM Card Lock is a security feature that protects your SIM card from unauthorized use on other devices. It requires you to enter a PIN (Personal Identification Number) to unlock the SIM card before you can use it.</p><p>The default PIN is usually printed on the back of the SIM card or its packaging. If you haven’t changed your PIN, use the 4-8 digit code provided by the carrier when you get your SIM card.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/02/sim-network-unlock-pin-02.jpg"                      alt="sim card lock pin"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://25home.pxf.io/c/5597632/2148643/16836" target="_top" id="2148643">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16836-2148643" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="75"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://25home.pxf.io/i/5597632/2148643/16836"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>If you’ve forgotten the <strong>SIM PIN code</strong>, you can use the PUK (PIN Unlock Key) code to unlock the SIM and set a new PIN. The PUK code is also printed on the SIM card packaging, but be careful, as entering the wrong PUK code too many times can permanently lock the SIM card.</p><p>Not knowing the <strong>SIM unlock PIN</strong> code can be frustrating, especially if you want to switch mobile carriers. So, in the next part, we’ll explore whether it’s possible to unlock a SIM network-locked iPhone device.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Can-a-SIM-Network-Locked-iPhone-Be-Unlocked"><a href="#Part-2-Can-a-SIM-Network-Locked-iPhone-Be-Unlocked" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Can a SIM Network Locked iPhone Be Unlocked?"></a>Part 2: Can a SIM Network Locked iPhone Be Unlocked?</h2><p>Yes, a SIM network-locked iPhone can be unlocked by your network provider.

Check with your carrier or manufacturer for details.</li><li>Costs: While some carriers can give <strong>SIM network unlock PIN for free</strong>, others may charge a fee. Third-party unlocking services also typically charge a fee.</li><li>Waiting time: It can take days or even weeks to receive your <strong>SIM unlock PIN</strong>code from your carrier and process it. For instance, Vodafone usually unlocks the Honor Play 8T device within 72 hours to 10 days if they have to reach the manufacturer.</li><li>Risks: Using an unauthorized unlocking method could damage your phone or void its warranty.</li><li>Backup: Before unlocking your phone, back up your data, as the process may erase it.</li></ul><p>Now that you understand <strong>SIM Network Unlock PIN</strong>, let’s get down to business!

Phones are our life source in this global age, it’s our tether to reality, to the world! But if you have a carrier locked phone, then that connection is basically under contract by an external agency! You can’t change your networks, there are limitations on how you use your phone, and when you have to travel abroad you have no option other than paying the roaming charges. If you, say, have an iPhone 5c and have these frustrations, it’s likely you’re already wondering how to unlock the iPhone 5c.</p><p>Chances are that if you’ve had a carrier locked phone for a while, you might have already forgotten what cellular freedom feels like. But we’re here to remind you. All you have to do is break that carrier-lock, and you’re good to go. However, you should be careful when doing so, cause if you try using a jailbreaking technique, it could have major repercussions. So we’re here to give you some valuable advice about how to unlock iPhone 5, iPhone 5c, or even Android phones.</p><h2 id="Part-1-Unlock-SIM-Card-on-Realme-11-5G-via-jailbreak"><a href="#Part-1-Unlock-SIM-Card-on-Realme-11-5G-via-jailbreak" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Unlock SIM Card on Realme 11 5G via jailbreak"></a>Part 1: Unlock SIM Card on Realme 11 5G via jailbreak</h2><p>Before we get into telling you how to unlock iPhone 5, or the SIM Card on iPhone or Android, we should first tell you what Jailbreaking is. You might have heard of this term before, and I’m sure it sounded ominous to you. Jailbreak? It sounds awfully close to ‘Prison break.’ Well, considering the carrier lock is sort of like a prison for your cell, it is an accurate terminology. But Jailbreak isn’t just about breaking the carrier lock. That might happen as a by-product, but the real purpose is to break free of the software restrictions which are generally applied to Apple devices. This might seem like a good option because, well, who doesn’t want to break free of all of Apple’s restrictions? But that always comes at several heavy risks.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2151858/7443" target="_top" id="2151858">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2151858" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="600" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2151858/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Threats-of-unlocking-SIM-via-Jailbreak"><a href="#Threats-of-unlocking-SIM-via-Jailbreak" class="headerlink" title="Threats of unlocking SIM via Jailbreak"></a>Threats of unlocking SIM via Jailbreak</h3><h4 id="1-Not-Permanent"><a href="#1-Not-Permanent" class="headerlink" title="1.

In fact, the moment you update your system, your jailbreak is lost and if you’ve started using a different SIM it will no longer function, and you’re gonna have to go back to using that Carrier you tried so hard to escape from! It’s really not worth the effort. Of course, you could stop updating altogether, but then that will bring us to…</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2016/10/14771444107532.jpg"                      alt="Unlock SIM Card on iPhone and Android via jailbreak"                ></p><h4 id="2-Risky"><a href="#2-Risky" class="headerlink" title="2.

As a result, you’re gonna’ have to restore the whole thing and try to salvage whatever information you can. Now those who do jailbreak regularly will give you all kinds of excuses like it happens only rarely or that you can retrieve your data simply from the cloud, et al.

It is safe, it is legal, it is hassle-free, and it doesn’t even lapse your warranty, which proves that it is an officially approved means of unlocking your iPhone. However, before we tell you how to unlock iPhone 5, you should probably be able to verify if your phone is unlocked already.</p><h2 id="Part-4-How-to-unlock-SIM-Card-on-iPhone-with-iPhoneIMEI-net-without-jailbreak"><a href="#Part-4-How-to-unlock-SIM-Card-on-iPhone-with-iPhoneIMEI-net-without-jailbreak" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: How to unlock SIM Card on iPhone with iPhoneIMEI.net without jailbreak"></a>Part 4: How to unlock SIM Card on iPhone with iPhoneIMEI.net without jailbreak</h2><p><a class="link"   href="https://appleiphoneunlock.uk/network/Special%20Services/Activation%20Lock?aff=wondershare" >iPhoneIMEI.net <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> uses an official method to unlock iPhone devices and whitelist your IMEI from Apple’s database. Your iPhone will be unlocked automatically Over-The-Air, simply connect it to a Wifi network (Available for iOS 7, iOS 8, iOS 9, iOS 10 or higher, iOS 6 or lower should be unlocked by iTunes). So you don’t need to send your iPhone to the network provider. The unlocked iPhone will never be relocked no matter you upgrade the OS or sync with iTunes.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2016/06/14670574228916.jpg"                      alt="sim unlock iphone with iphoneimei.net"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2087409/7443" target="_top" id="2087409">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2087409" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2087409/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><strong>How to unlock iPhone with iPhoneIMEI?</strong></p><p>Step 1.

You loved the Honor 90 GT device but your network provider does not have any plans that exactly suit your needs. To release your device from your current network’s clutches, you will need to unlock your phone.</p><p>There are three ways you can do it and this post will go through each method so that you can find one that you are most comfortable with. Do note that if your contract has ended with your network provider, this “How to unlock Honor 90 GT” post can be skipped as you can just ask them to unlock your phone or purchase a <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/unlock/unlock-samsung-sim-network-unlock-pin.html" >sim network unlock pin <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> for a minimal price.</p><h2 id="Part-1-Honor-90-GT-Unlock-Code"><a href="#Part-1-Honor-90-GT-Unlock-Code" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Honor 90 GT Unlock Code"></a>Part 1: Honor 90 GT Unlock Code</h2><p>This is probably the easiest, no-fuss method to <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/unlock-android-screen/" >sim unlock <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> Honor 90 GT. Follow these steps carefully to successfully perform Honor 90 GT unlock code.</p><p>Do take note that this process may not work with your carrier. Therefore, always check if this is the right way to obtain the necessary code:</p><ul><li>1. Check the SIM lock status—you can do this by dialing <strong>*#*#7378423#*#*</strong>.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2016/08/14707989592943.jpg"                      alt="sony xperia unlock code"                ></p><ul><li>2. Tap <strong>Service info</strong> then <strong>Sim lock</strong>.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2016/08/14707989592897.jpg"                      alt="unlock with sony xperia unlock code"                ></p><ul><li>3. The number beside <strong>Network</strong> indicates how many attempts you have to unlock the phone. If it says ‘7’ it means you have seven attempts; ‘0’ simply means it is hard locked and cannot be unlocked using this method.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2016/08/14707989597664.jpg"                      alt="unlock code sony xperia"                ></p><ul><li>4. Find the <strong>IMEI number</strong> by dialing <strong>*#06#</strong>. Jot it down as this will be your code.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2016/08/14707998453087.jpg"                      alt="sony unlock code"                ></p><ul><li>5. Insert your new SIM card and tap in the IMEI number when it asks you for SIM network unlock PIN.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2016/08/unlock-screen.jpg"                      alt="sony unlock screen"                ></p><p>If you have followed these steps to a tee, you should have unlocked your device. If you had to abort after Step 2, look at the other two methods below.</p><h2 id="Part-2-The-Best-Honor-90-GT-SIM-Unlock-Code-Generator"><a href="#Part-2-The-Best-Honor-90-GT-SIM-Unlock-Code-Generator" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: The Best Honor 90 GT SIM Unlock Code Generator"></a>Part 2: The Best Honor 90 GT SIM Unlock Code Generator</h2><p>To safely and successfully sim unlock your Honor 90 GT, it is important to find a trustworthy <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/unlock-android-screen/" >sim network unlock pin software <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. Here I am going you present to you DoctorSIM - SIM Unlock Service. It definitely is one of the best sim unlocking code generators in the market. It helps you permanently sim unlock your phone so you can use it on any carrier provider you want in the world.</p><h3 id="How-to-use-SIM-Unlock-Service"><a href="#How-to-use-SIM-Unlock-Service" class="headerlink" title="How to use SIM Unlock Service"></a>How to use SIM Unlock Service</h3><p>Step 1. Visit Doctor - SIM Unlock Service official website, click on the Select Your Honor 90 GT button, and then select Honor among all the phone brands.</p><p>Step 2. On the new window, fill in your phone IMEI number, model, your contact email, and other required information. Once your order is processed, the system will then send you the unlock code and instructions. You can follow the instruction to unlock your phone easily.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Honor-90-GT-Unlock-Carrier"><a href="#Part-3-Honor-90-GT-Unlock-Carrier" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Honor 90 GT Unlock Carrier"></a>Part 3: Honor 90 GT Unlock Carrier</h2><p>If your Honor 90 GT is hard locked, this is your best bet in getting your device unlocked. Actually, it is the safest method among all three:</p><ol><li>Get a new SIM card from a new carrier.</li><li>Call your carrier’s customer service line and ask what are the requirements to qualify you to get your Honor 90 GT unlocked. If you have honored your contract, there should not be any problems. However, do ask your carrier if there are any additional requirements. Do note that there may be fees involved.</li><li>Once your customer service representative has determined if you have met all their requirements, they should give you the SIM network unlock PIN Honor 90 GT. Again, depending on your carrier, they might either give you the code over the phone, through email or via SMS. If you have the choice, always opt for email or SMS so that you are able to jot down the right number.</li><li>Once you have gotten the code, insert the new SIM card (from your new carrier). You will receive a prompt to enter your code. Make sure that you key in the right code—entering the wrong code will cause your phone to be locked (possibly forever).</li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2016/08/unlock-screen.jpg"                      alt="sony unlock screen"                ></p><h2 id="Part-4-Honor-90-GT-Unlock-App-Software"><a href="#Part-4-Honor-90-GT-Unlock-App-Software" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: Honor 90 GT Unlock App&#x2F;Software"></a>Part 4: Honor 90 GT Unlock App&#x2F;Software</h2><p>There are some of us out there who are just not confident with doing things ourselves or trusting our own carrier.</p><p>HOWEVER, if your first instinct is to head to Google Play to look for SIM unlock tools, heed these cautions. There are currently many apps that claim that they can unlock your phone but it is just a scam. You should also avoid torrent files available online. These apps and software are usually laced with Trojans and other types of malware. So do sort through the reviews so that you will not fall into a malicious trap.</p><p>One that we can attest to is  <strong><a class="link"   href="http://mymobileunlocking.com/" >MyMobileUnlocking.com <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong>; it is fast and affordable.

Therefore, if you travel frequently around the world, having an unlocked Honor 90 GT would be beneficial. Using a local SIM card is much cheaper than paying for exorbitant roaming charges.</p><p>You can also benefit from an unlocked Honor 90 GT if you are the kind of person who likes to take advantage of current offers provided by your local carriers. Prepaid plans are always changing in terms of offering so having the flexibility of changing carriers and prepaid plans can help you save money in the long run.</p><h2 id="Part-6-The-downside-of-an-unlocked-Honor-90-GT"><a href="#Part-6-The-downside-of-an-unlocked-Honor-90-GT" class="headerlink" title="Part 6: The downside of an unlocked Honor 90 GT"></a>Part 6: The downside of an unlocked Honor 90 GT</h2><p>Are you thinking “Well, why can’t I just buy an unlocked Honor 90 GT in the first place?” right about now? Well, you can but think of the amount of money it will cost you.</p><p>For example, in Australia, an unlocked Honor 90 GT will cost around $499 from any Honor outlet but $0 for the Honor 90 GT device when you pair it with a 24-month postpaid plan.

This 4-digit code protects your phone number from unauthorized calls, texts, and data use. It’s essential to change the default PIN to one that’s both memorable for you and difficult for others to guess.</p><p>So, <strong>how to change the PIN on an Android phone</strong>’s SIM card? This article will provide a step-by-step guide to help you secure your data. But first, let’s explore why changing the default one is important.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/02/how-to-change-pin-on-android-phone-01.jpg"                      alt="a phone sim card"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-Why-Does-Changing-Your-SIM-PIN-Code-Matter-on-a-New-Phone"><a href="#Part-1-Why-Does-Changing-Your-SIM-PIN-Code-Matter-on-a-New-Phone" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Why Does Changing Your SIM PIN Code Matter on a New Phone?"></a>Part 1: Why Does Changing Your SIM PIN Code Matter on a New Phone?</h2><p>Your SIM PIN code acts as a password for your SIM card, which stores your phone number, contacts, and other essential data. Unlike the PIN you use to unlock your phone, the SIM PIN code is a separate layer of security. If someone tries to use your SIM card in another phone without the correct PIN, they won’t be able to access your network or data.</p><p>Here are more reasons why <strong>changing the PIN code of a SIM card</strong> is a smart move:</p><ul><li>Default PINs are easy to guess</li></ul><p>Most carriers use generic PINs like “1234” or “0000”. Change it to something unique and harder to crack.</p><ul><li>Protects data in case of loss or theft</li></ul><p>If you lose your phone or it gets stolen, a strong PIN code hinders the thief’s ability to make calls, send messages, or access your data stored on the SIM. It buys you time to report the loss and block your SIM card before they can do any damage.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/02/how-to-change-pin-on-android-phone-02.jpg"                      alt="sim card locked"                ></p><ul><li>Prevents accidental PIN lockouts</li></ul><p>Using a memorable PIN minimizes the risk of accidentally locking yourself out of your SIM card.</p><ul><li>Peace of mind</li></ul><p>It is crucial if you store sensitive info on your SIM or use your phone for work. Knowing about this extra safeguard is reassuring, ensuring your data stays protected.</p><p><strong>Remember:</strong></p><p>Choose a PIN code for your SIM that’s easy for you to remember but challenging for others to guess. Avoid using birthdays, anniversaries, or other easily identifiable information. By taking a few minutes to <strong>change the PIN code of the SIM card</strong>, you’ll gain a significant security advantage for your new phone and data.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1925484/19272" target="_top" id="1925484">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1925484" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1925484/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-2-How-To-Change-Pin-on-Android-Phone-SIM-Cards"><a href="#Part-2-How-To-Change-Pin-on-Android-Phone-SIM-Cards" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How To Change Pin on Android Phone SIM Cards?"></a>Part 2: How To Change Pin on Android Phone SIM Cards?</h2><p>Keeping your SIM card secure is crucial for protecting your data and privacy. Thankfully, Android allows you to easily change your SIM card PIN to a more personal and memorable code. But before you begin:</p><ul><li>Contact your network carrier to get your PUK code if you already have it. You’ll need this if you enter the wrong PIN three times and lock your SIM card.</li><li>Remember the temporary default PIN: Most SIM cards have a default PIN, often 1234 or 0123. If you haven’t changed it, this is the PIN you’ll use initially.</li></ul><p><strong>Note:</strong></p><p>Entering the wrong PIN three times will lock your SIM card. You’ll need your network carrier’s PUK code to unlock it. Use it cautiously, as exceeding the maximum number of attempts will permanently block your SIM card. So, it’s best to memorize your PIN or store it securely to avoid relying on the PUK altogether.</p><p>Steps To Change Your SIM PIN</p><p>Here’s <strong>how to find and manage the SIM PIN code on Android</strong>:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Navigate to your phone’s <strong>Settings</strong> app. Next, look for the <strong>Security and privacy</strong> or <strong>Lock screen and security</strong> (or other similar option) depending on your device’s model.</li><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Scroll down and tap on <strong>More security settings</strong> or <strong>Other security settings</strong>.</li><li><strong>Step 3:</strong> Tap <strong>SIM card security</strong> or <strong>Set up SIM card lock</strong> (or something similar).</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/02/how-to-change-pin-on-android-phone-03.jpg"                      alt="sim card security in settings"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Step 4:</strong> If you have multiple SIMs, select the one you want to change the PIN code.</li><li><strong>Step 5:</strong> Tap <strong>Change SIM PIN</strong>.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/02/how-to-change-pin-on-android-phone-04.jpg"                      alt="change sim pin code on android"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Step 6:</strong> Input your current SIM card PIN code and tap <strong>OK</strong>.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/02/how-to-change-pin-on-android-phone-05.jpg"                      alt="enter old sim pin"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Step 7:</strong> Enter your desired new PIN code and tap <strong>OK</strong>.</li><li><strong>Step 8:</strong> Re-enter your new SIM card PIN code and tap <strong>OK</strong> to confirm.</li></ul><p>Success!

This article will explain what a <strong>SIM network unlock PIN</strong> is, the process involved, and answer any questions you might have.

But your phone pops up with a request for a PIN code to unlock it. What’s that all about, and what do you enter? There are two main reasons why your phone might be asking for a SIM PIN or unlock code:</p><p>SIM Network Lock</p><p>The SIM Network Lock is a restriction placed by your phone’s original network provider, locking it to their network. It means you can only use the Realme GT 5 (240W) device with SIM cards from that specific carrier. Carriers use this to ensure that the phones they sell work only with their service. When you buy a subsidized phone, they want to ensure you stick around for the contract duration.</p><p>If you insert a SIM card from a different carrier, your phone will ask for a <strong>SIM Network Unlock PIN</strong> or Network Unlock Code (NUC). You’ll learn more about it in the upcoming sections of this article.</p><p>SIM Card Lock</p><p>SIM Card Lock is a security feature that protects your SIM card from unauthorized use on other devices. It requires you to enter a PIN (Personal Identification Number) to unlock the SIM card before you can use it.</p><p>The default PIN is usually printed on the back of the SIM card or its packaging. If you haven’t changed your PIN, use the 4-8 digit code provided by the carrier when you get your SIM card.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/02/sim-network-unlock-pin-02.jpg"                      alt="sim card lock pin"                ></p><p>If you’ve forgotten the <strong>SIM PIN code</strong>, you can use the PUK (PIN Unlock Key) code to unlock the SIM and set a new PIN. The PUK code is also printed on the SIM card packaging, but be careful, as entering the wrong PUK code too many times can permanently lock the SIM card.</p><p>Not knowing the <strong>SIM unlock PIN</strong> code can be frustrating, especially if you want to switch mobile carriers. So, in the next part, we’ll explore whether it’s possible to unlock a SIM network-locked iPhone device.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Can-a-SIM-Network-Locked-iPhone-Be-Unlocked"><a href="#Part-2-Can-a-SIM-Network-Locked-iPhone-Be-Unlocked" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Can a SIM Network Locked iPhone Be Unlocked?"></a>Part 2: Can a SIM Network Locked iPhone Be Unlocked?</h2><p>Yes, a SIM network-locked iPhone can be unlocked by your network provider.

Check with your carrier or manufacturer for details.</li><li>Costs: While some carriers can give <strong>SIM network unlock PIN for free</strong>, others may charge a fee. Third-party unlocking services also typically charge a fee.</li><li>Waiting time: It can take days or even weeks to receive your <strong>SIM unlock PIN</strong>code from your carrier and process it. For instance, Vodafone usually unlocks the Realme GT 5 (240W) device within 72 hours to 10 days if they have to reach the manufacturer.</li><li>Risks: Using an unauthorized unlocking method could damage your phone or void its warranty.</li><li>Backup: Before unlocking your phone, back up your data, as the process may erase it.</li></ul><p>Now that you understand <strong>SIM Network Unlock PIN</strong>, let’s get down to business!

Phones are our life source in this global age, it’s our tether to reality, to the world! But if you have a carrier locked phone, then that connection is basically under contract by an external agency! You can’t change your networks, there are limitations on how you use your phone, and when you have to travel abroad you have no option other than paying the roaming charges. If you, say, have an iPhone 5c and have these frustrations, it’s likely you’re already wondering how to unlock the iPhone 5c.</p><p>Chances are that if you’ve had a carrier locked phone for a while, you might have already forgotten what cellular freedom feels like. But we’re here to remind you. All you have to do is break that carrier-lock, and you’re good to go. However, you should be careful when doing so, cause if you try using a jailbreaking technique, it could have major repercussions. So we’re here to give you some valuable advice about how to unlock iPhone 5, iPhone 5c, or even Android phones.</p><h2 id="Part-1-Unlock-SIM-Card-on-Realme-GT-5-240W-via-jailbreak"><a href="#Part-1-Unlock-SIM-Card-on-Realme-GT-5-240W-via-jailbreak" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Unlock SIM Card on Realme GT 5 (240W) via jailbreak"></a>Part 1: Unlock SIM Card on Realme GT 5 (240W) via jailbreak</h2><p>Before we get into telling you how to unlock iPhone 5, or the SIM Card on iPhone or Android, we should first tell you what Jailbreaking is. You might have heard of this term before, and I’m sure it sounded ominous to you. Jailbreak? It sounds awfully close to ‘Prison break.’ Well, considering the carrier lock is sort of like a prison for your cell, it is an accurate terminology. But Jailbreak isn’t just about breaking the carrier lock. That might happen as a by-product, but the real purpose is to break free of the software restrictions which are generally applied to Apple devices. This might seem like a good option because, well, who doesn’t want to break free of all of Apple’s restrictions? But that always comes at several heavy risks.</p><h3 id="Threats-of-unlocking-SIM-via-Jailbreak"><a href="#Threats-of-unlocking-SIM-via-Jailbreak" class="headerlink" title="Threats of unlocking SIM via Jailbreak"></a>Threats of unlocking SIM via Jailbreak</h3><h4 id="1-Not-Permanent"><a href="#1-Not-Permanent" class="headerlink" title="1. Not Permanent"></a>1. Not Permanent</h4><p>This has got to be one of the biggest reasons for not jailbreaking your phone. It is not at all permanent! In fact, the moment you update your system, your jailbreak is lost and if you’ve started using a different SIM it will no longer function, and you’re gonna have to go back to using that Carrier you tried so hard to escape from! It’s really not worth the effort. Of course, you could stop updating altogether, but then that will bring us to…</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2016/10/14771444107532.jpg"                      alt="Unlock SIM Card on iPhone and Android via jailbreak"                ></p><h4 id="2-Risky"><a href="#2-Risky" class="headerlink" title="2. Risky"></a>2. Risky</h4><p>If you don’t update your iOS, or Mac or iPad or any device at all, in this day and age, you’re basically just asking to be hacked. That is not to excuse those who do the hacking and plant malware on your system, but if you leave your front door open in a shitty neighborhood, well then you only have yourself to blame once you get robbed!</p><h4 id="3-Warranty"><a href="#3-Warranty" class="headerlink" title="3. Warranty"></a>3. Warranty</h4><p>Jailbreaking has now become kind-of-legal, in a very tenuous sense, but that doesn’t mean Apple wholeheartedly welcomes jailbreaking. If you do so, you will never again be able to avail of the warranty on your phone. And with the kind of major bucks you have to shell out for those iPhones, you best keep that warranty intact.</p><h4 id="4-Lack-of-Apps"><a href="#4-Lack-of-Apps" class="headerlink" title="4. Lack of Apps"></a>4. Lack of Apps</h4><p>Many top-notch and crucial app companies and organizations simply refuse to make their applications usable in jailbreak phones, as they are extremely risky and prone to hacking. As a result, you would have to rely on a bunch of non-professional apps made by amateurs, which is more likely to put your phone in harm’s way.</p><h4 id="5-Bricking"><a href="#5-Bricking" class="headerlink" title="5. Bricking"></a>5. Bricking</h4><p>This basically means your whole system may crash and stop functioning. As a result, you’re gonna’ have to restore the whole thing and try to salvage whatever information you can. Now those who do jailbreak regularly will give you all kinds of excuses like it happens only rarely or that you can retrieve your data simply from the cloud, et al. But do you really want to divest all your time and energy trying to fight off malware, backing up all your data, etc, especially when there is a much more convenient option just around the corner?</p><p>Didn’t think so.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-unlock-SIM-Card-on-iPhone-without-jailbreak-Bonus"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-unlock-SIM-Card-on-iPhone-without-jailbreak-Bonus" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to unlock SIM Card on iPhone without jailbreak[Bonus]"></a>Part 2: How to unlock SIM Card on iPhone without jailbreak[Bonus]</h2><p>As mentioned above, unlocking by jailbreaking is risky and only temporary. Therefore, this is not a very good choice. Honestly, a professional and reliable SIM unlock software is the best option. The good news for iPhone users is coming!

Up until a while back, one of the reasons people chose to jailbreak their phones is because the legitimate means was such a headache in which you had to contact the carrier and request a change, and even then they could refuse after several weeks of ‘verification.’ However, now with the slow introduction of apps that can essentially do all the work for you, within a matter of 48 hours, it really makes no sense to jailbreak. So now we’ll tell you how to unlock iPhone 5c using an Online iPhone unlock tool called DoctorSIM Unlock Service.</p><p>SIM Unlock Service is really quite the revolutionary tool which just needs your IMEI code and can do all the work for you and send you the unlock code within a guaranteed period of 48 hours! It is safe, it is legal, it is hassle-free, and it doesn’t even lapse your warranty, which proves that it is an officially approved means of unlocking your iPhone. However, before we tell you how to unlock iPhone 5, you should probably be able to verify if your phone is unlocked already.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/c/5597632/2134240/18498" target="_top" id="2134240">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18498-2134240" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="540" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/i/5597632/2134240/18498"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-4-How-to-unlock-SIM-Card-on-iPhone-with-iPhoneIMEI-net-without-jailbreak"><a href="#Part-4-How-to-unlock-SIM-Card-on-iPhone-with-iPhoneIMEI-net-without-jailbreak" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: How to unlock SIM Card on iPhone with iPhoneIMEI.net without jailbreak"></a>Part 4: How to unlock SIM Card on iPhone with iPhoneIMEI.net without jailbreak</h2><p><a class="link"   href="https://appleiphoneunlock.uk/network/Special%20Services/Activation%20Lock?aff=wondershare" >iPhoneIMEI.net <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> uses an official method to unlock iPhone devices and whitelist your IMEI from Apple’s database.
