Get Your Honor Magic V2 Phone Network-Ready</h2><p>A network-locked device tethers you to one carrier, limiting your choices. You might miss out on better deals, struggle with roaming charges abroad, or feel inconvenienced by limited coverage. And you can’t avoid these things without the right <strong>SIM network unlock PIN</strong>.</p><p>That’s why we’ve created this comprehensive guide to help you unlock your phone’s potential. This article will explain what a <strong>SIM network unlock PIN</strong> is, the process involved, and answer any questions you might have. Keep scrolling to learn more.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/02/sim-network-unlock-pin-01.jpg"                      alt="enter sim network unlock pin"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-Why-Is-Your-Honor-Magic-V2-Asking-for-a-SIM-Network-Unlock-PIN"><a href="#Part-1-Why-Is-Your-Honor-Magic-V2-Asking-for-a-SIM-Network-Unlock-PIN" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Why Is Your Honor Magic V2 Asking for a SIM Network Unlock PIN?"></a>Part 1: Why Is Your Honor Magic V2 Asking for a SIM Network Unlock PIN?</h2><p>You just bought a new phone, excited to use it with a new SIM card. But your phone pops up with a request for a PIN code to unlock it. What’s that all about, and what do you enter? There are two main reasons why your phone might be asking for a SIM PIN or unlock code:</p><p>SIM Network Lock</p><p>The SIM Network Lock is a restriction placed by your phone’s original network provider, locking it to their network. It means you can only use the Honor Magic V2 device with SIM cards from that specific carrier. Carriers use this to ensure that the phones they sell work only with their service. When you buy a subsidized phone, they want to ensure you stick around for the contract duration.</p><p>If you insert a SIM card from a different carrier, your phone will ask for a <strong>SIM Network Unlock PIN</strong> or Network Unlock Code (NUC). You’ll learn more about it in the upcoming sections of this article.</p><p>SIM Card Lock</p><p>SIM Card Lock is a security feature that protects your SIM card from unauthorized use on other devices. It requires you to enter a PIN (Personal Identification Number) to unlock the SIM card before you can use it.</p><p>The default PIN is usually printed on the back of the SIM card or its packaging. If you haven’t changed your PIN, use the 4-8 digit code provided by the carrier when you get your SIM card.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/02/sim-network-unlock-pin-02.jpg"                      alt="sim card lock pin"                ></p><p>If you’ve forgotten the <strong>SIM PIN code</strong>, you can use the PUK (PIN Unlock Key) code to unlock the SIM and set a new PIN. The PUK code is also printed on the SIM card packaging, but be careful, as entering the wrong PUK code too many times can permanently lock the SIM card.</p><p>Not knowing the <strong>SIM unlock PIN</strong> code can be frustrating, especially if you want to switch mobile carriers. So, in the next part, we’ll explore whether it’s possible to unlock a SIM network-locked iPhone device.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Can-a-SIM-Network-Locked-iPhone-Be-Unlocked"><a href="#Part-2-Can-a-SIM-Network-Locked-iPhone-Be-Unlocked" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Can a SIM Network Locked iPhone Be Unlocked?"></a>Part 2: Can a SIM Network Locked iPhone Be Unlocked?</h2><p>Yes, a SIM network-locked iPhone can be unlocked by your network provider. Insert a new SIM card, and you’ll be prompted to enter the <strong>SIM Network Unlock PIN</strong>. After inputting the correct unlock code, your iPhone is ready to use with any carrier.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/02/sim-network-unlock-pin-03.jpg"                      alt="sim not valid message on iphone"                ></p><p>If you are thinking about unlocking your iPhone, it’s crucial to grasp what a <strong>SIM Network Unlock PIN</strong> is and how it functions.</p><h2 id="Part-3-What-Is-a-SIM-Network-Unlock-PIN"><a href="#Part-3-What-Is-a-SIM-Network-Unlock-PIN" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: What Is a SIM Network Unlock PIN?"></a>Part 3: What Is a SIM Network Unlock PIN?</h2><p>A <strong>SIM network unlock PIN</strong> is a code allowing you to remove your phone’s network lock. It means you can use your phone with a SIM card from any compatible network provider, not just the one you originally bought it from. It is also known as Network Unlock PIN (NUP), Network Control Key (NCK), or Network Unlock Code (NUC).</p><p>Unlocking your device can be useful if you:</p><ul><li>Bought a phone locked to a specific carrier and want to switch to a different one.</li><li>Are planning a trip abroad and want to use a local SIM card instead.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/02/sim-network-unlock-pin-04.jpg"                      alt="international travel illustration"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://shop.incomedia.eu/order/checkout.php?PRODS=14095146&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.2checkout.com/images/merchant/8b6cc3ee5ec407721ce3bf5ff4c0f56b/PRO_BUY_728x90-EN.jpg"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><ul><li>Still haven’t finished your contract with your original carrier and want to keep the phone but use a different service.</li><li>Bought a phone second-hand locked to the previous owner’s network.</li><li>Want to increase your phone’s resale value; unlocked phones generally have a higher resale value than locked phones, as various buyers can use them.</li><li>Want more carrier flexibility; you are not tied to one carrier and can choose the provider that best suits your needs in terms of price, coverage, data plans, and other features.</li></ul><p>Things To Consider</p><p>Before you proceed, here are some key points to remember:</p><ul><li>Eligibility: Not all phones are eligible for network unlocking. Check with your carrier or manufacturer for details.</li><li>Costs: While some carriers can give <strong>SIM network unlock PIN for free</strong>, others may charge a fee. Third-party unlocking services also typically charge a fee.</li><li>Waiting time: It can take days or even weeks to receive your <strong>SIM unlock PIN</strong>code from your carrier and process it. For instance, Vodafone usually unlocks the Honor Magic V2 device within 72 hours to 10 days if they have to reach the manufacturer.</li><li>Risks: Using an unauthorized unlocking method could damage your phone or void its warranty.</li><li>Backup: Before unlocking your phone, back up your data, as the process may erase it.</li></ul><p>Now that you understand <strong>SIM Network Unlock PIN</strong>, let’s get down to business!

Freedom to choose your carrier</strong></li></ul><p>When your phone is carrier locked, you are limited to using only the carrier that the phone is locked to.

By unlocking your phone’s SIM card, you will be able to use any carrier’s SIM card, giving you the freedom to choose the carrier that best suits your needs.</p><ul><li><strong>2. Cost savings</strong></li></ul><p>By unlocking your phone’s SIM card, you can save money on roaming charges when traveling. Instead of paying expensive roaming charges, you can simply purchase a local SIM card and use it in your unlocked phone. This can save you a lot of money in the long run.</p><ul><li><strong>3. Resale value</strong></li></ul><p>An unlocked phone has a higher resale value than a carrier-locked phone. This is because an unlocked phone can be used with any carrier’s SIM card, making it more attractive to buyers.</p><ul><li><strong>4. No need to buy a new phone</strong></li></ul><p>If you want to switch to a different carrier, you may be tempted to buy a new phone that is compatible with that carrier. However, by unlocking your phone’s SIM card, you can use your existing phone with any carrier’s SIM card, saving you the cost of buying a new phone.</p><h2 id="Part-4-4-Android-SIM-Unlock-Code-Generators-Reviews"><a href="#Part-4-4-Android-SIM-Unlock-Code-Generators-Reviews" class="headerlink" title="Part 4. 4 Android SIM Unlock Code Generators Reviews"></a>Part 4. 4 Android SIM Unlock Code Generators Reviews</h2><p>There are several Android SIM unlock code generator software available on the internet.

This would cause problems if for instance you wanted to travel outside the country and want to switch to that country’s carrier for the duration of your stay.

But this has often proven difficult because of the fact that you need unlock codes.

If you have been unsuccessfully searching for free unlocking codes for your device, look no further.

Actually, it is the safest method among all three:</p><ol><li>Get a new SIM card from a new carrier.</li><li>Call your carrier’s customer service line and ask what are the requirements to qualify you to get your Infinix Hot 40 Pro unlocked. If you have honored your contract, there should not be any problems. However, do ask your carrier if there are any additional requirements. Do note that there may be fees involved.</li><li>Once your customer service representative has determined if you have met all their requirements, they should give you the SIM network unlock PIN Infinix Hot 40 Pro. Again, depending on your carrier, they might either give you the code over the phone, through email or via SMS. If you have the choice, always opt for email or SMS so that you are able to jot down the right number.</li><li>Once you have gotten the code, insert the new SIM card (from your new carrier). You will receive a prompt to enter your code.

Your SIM locks itself after three to five wrong inputs, on average. Although it might be annoying, doing these guards against unauthorized access to your phone and personal data. If your cell phone is lost or stolen, PUK blocked will prevent prospective hackers from making calls.</p><p>Your mobile phone display can say “PIN blocked” or “Enter PUK code.” PUK stands for PIN Unblocking Key in the PUK code. The PUK code is seldom given to you when you receive your membership in the US. Contact Your Tecno Pova 5 Pro provider’s customer support if you don’t know your PUK code.</p><h2 id="Part-1-Why-Was-My-Sim-Card-Blocked"><a href="#Part-1-Why-Was-My-Sim-Card-Blocked" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Why Was My Sim Card Blocked?"></a>Part 1: Why Was My Sim Card Blocked?</h2><h3 id="1-3-times-incorrect-Pin-entered"><a href="#1-3-times-incorrect-Pin-entered" class="headerlink" title="1. 3 times incorrect Pin entered"></a>1. 3 times incorrect Pin entered</h3><p>Sometimes when you forget your pin and keep on entering the wrong one, you can get PUK Blocked. You can utilize three to five chances, and your sim gets blocked when you enter the incorrect pin in all of these attempts.</p><h3 id="2-Wrong-PUK-code-entered"><a href="#2-Wrong-PUK-code-entered" class="headerlink" title="2. Wrong PUK code entered"></a>2. Wrong PUK code entered</h3><p>Sims are frequently blocked; therefore, if you have your PUK, keep it in a secure location separate from your phone. This is because it is the key to unlocking your SIM. The SIM will be permanently disabled, and you will have to buy a new SIM card if you input the wrong PUK ten times in a row.</p><h2 id="Part-2-What-To-Do-When-I-Blocked-My-Sim-Card"><a href="#Part-2-What-To-Do-When-I-Blocked-My-Sim-Card" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: What To Do When I Blocked My Sim Card?"></a>Part 2: What To Do When I Blocked My Sim Card?</h2><p>Your SIM card has been disabled to protect your security if you enter three wrong PINs and your phone shows “SIM card banned” or “Enter PUK code”.</p><p>You must input a PUK (PIN Unlock Key) code to unlock your SIM card.</p><p>Go to your phone’s settings to customize your PIN code after using a PUK code to unlock your SIM card. Pick a PIN that is simple to remember.</p><p>If your PUK code was delivered to you by email:</p><p>You got an email with multiple codes, including PUK1, PIN2, and PUK2.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/10/how-to-unlock-puk-blocked-sim-card-1.jpg"                      alt="go to settings and customize to unblock sim"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4572700&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.tubedigger.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/tubedigger-software-new.png"                      border="0"                >TubeDigger - online video downloader from mostly any site</a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>If your PIN is locked, use PUK1 to unlock it.</p><p>Only a few phones employ PIN2 and PUK2 codes to restrict access to certain SIM card functionalities.</p><p>PIN2: The default code for your SIM card; If this code has been altered, use the PUK2 code to restore it.</p><p>PUK2: Your PIN2’s unlock code if it has been blocked.</p><h2 id="Part-3-How-Can-I-Have-My-PUK-Code-To-Unlock-Sim-Card"><a href="#Part-3-How-Can-I-Have-My-PUK-Code-To-Unlock-Sim-Card" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How Can I Have My PUK Code To Unlock Sim Card?"></a>Part 3: How Can I Have My PUK Code To Unlock Sim Card?</h2><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=174416&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.easygifanimator.net/images/gif-animator.png"                      border="0"                >Easy GIF Animator is a powerful animated GIF editor and the top tool for creating animated pictures, banners, buttons and GIF videos.

Please log in to the appropriate website or app, then go to your profile to see whether anything about “PUK” is available there.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/10/how-to-unlock-puk-blocked-sim-card-5.jpg"                      alt="go to career website and check your sim card puk"                ></p><p>It shouldn’t be an issue if you were utilizing or signed in to the platform before your SIM was disabled. However, if not, you might not be able to access anything since you could be asked to input an OTP to verify your identity.</p><p>Please remove the SIM card and try again if you can’t access your phone to utilize the app or website because of the SIM lock. After receiving the PUK code, you can re-insert the SIM and input it.</p><h3 id="3-Contact-your-carrier"><a href="#3-Contact-your-carrier" class="headerlink" title="3. Contact your carrier"></a>3. Contact your carrier</h3><p>It’s time to call customer support, which should be simpler for most individuals if none of the above options work for you. For example, your mobile service provider created your SIM card. Therefore, they have all the information you would require. Before they divulge anything to you, though, they should be able to verify your identity.</p><p>Use a different phone to call your customer service number and describe the issue. And following a series of inquiries, they should offer your PUK number as identification.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/10/how-to-unlock-puk-blocked-sim-card-6.jpg"                      alt="solve the sim card not accessed issue"                ></p><p>However, customer service won’t release the code if you can’t back yourself up. And at that point, there’s probably nothing further you can do. Therefore, make sure you have some information, such as your name, address, date of birth, etc., before you call them.</p><h2 id="Part-4-Easy-Tool-For-Sim-Card-Unlock"><a href="#Part-4-Easy-Tool-For-Sim-Card-Unlock" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: Easy Tool For Sim Card Unlock"></a>Part 4: Easy Tool For Sim Card Unlock</h2><p>If you want to unlock your PUK blocked sim card, you can use a network unlock tool like Dr.Fone.

Benefits of Using Android SIM Unlock Code Generator"></a>Part 3. Benefits of Using Android SIM Unlock Code Generator</h2><p>There are several benefits of using Android SIM unlock code generator. Some of these benefits are:</p><ul><li><strong>1. Freedom to choose your carrier</strong></li></ul><p>When your phone is carrier locked, you are limited to using only the carrier that the phone is locked to. This can be a problem if you travel frequently or want to switch to a different carrier. By unlocking your phone’s SIM card, you will be able to use any carrier’s SIM card, giving you the freedom to choose the carrier that best suits your needs.</p><ul><li><strong>2. Cost savings</strong></li></ul><p>By unlocking your phone’s SIM card, you can save money on roaming charges when traveling. Instead of paying expensive roaming charges, you can simply purchase a local SIM card and use it in your unlocked phone. This can save you a lot of money in the long run.</p><ul><li><strong>3. Resale value</strong></li></ul><p>An unlocked phone has a higher resale value than a carrier-locked phone. This is because an unlocked phone can be used with any carrier’s SIM card, making it more attractive to buyers.</p><ul><li><strong>4. No need to buy a new phone</strong></li></ul><p>If you want to switch to a different carrier, you may be tempted to buy a new phone that is compatible with that carrier. However, by unlocking your phone’s SIM card, you can use your existing phone with any carrier’s SIM card, saving you the cost of buying a new phone.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4709458&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://3d-kstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Project-Manager-version-3-1600x900-768x419.jpg"                      border="0"                >Project Manager - Asset Browser for 3Ds Max</a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-4-4-Android-SIM-Unlock-Code-Generators-Reviews"><a href="#Part-4-4-Android-SIM-Unlock-Code-Generators-Reviews" class="headerlink" title="Part 4. 4 Android SIM Unlock Code Generators Reviews"></a>Part 4. 4 Android SIM Unlock Code Generators Reviews</h2><p>There are several Android SIM unlock code generator software available on the internet.

This locking mechanism is usually put in place by the carrier or the phone manufacturer to ensure that you continue to use their services, typically for the duration of a contract. As a result, your phone cannot be freely used with SIM cards from other carriers until it’s unlocked using the correct PIN or code.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/11/fix-network-locked-simcard-inserted-01.jpg"                      alt="sim locked"                ></p><h2 id="Part-2-Why-Does-Your-Honor-Play-8T-Say-Invalid-SIM-Card-–-Network-Locked-SIM-Card-Inserted"><a href="#Part-2-Why-Does-Your-Honor-Play-8T-Say-Invalid-SIM-Card-–-Network-Locked-SIM-Card-Inserted" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Why Does Your Honor Play 8T Say Invalid SIM Card – Network Locked SIM Card Inserted?"></a>Part 2: Why Does Your Honor Play 8T Say Invalid SIM Card – Network Locked SIM Card Inserted?</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/11/fix-network-locked-simcard-inserted-2.jpg"                      alt="remove network lock"                ></p><p><strong>System Errors</strong></p><p>Since SIM locking is a smartphone restriction implemented to stop it from being used on other networks, Android system errors can cause network-locked SIM cards. Resetting these errors can help unlock your <strong>network locked SIM card inserted</strong> device. Service providers decided to provide a formal SIM unlocking option as a result.</p><p>Because of this, any locked SIM may be readily unlocked, and once a device opens, it can work like a conventional mobile phone and with any SIM card of the user’s choosing.</p><p><strong>Carrier Lock</strong></p><p>The consumer must stick with the same service provider for a specific time after purchasing the bundled device and data pack. This is called a carrier lock on the Honor Play 8T device and is one of the most common errors in <strong>network locked SIM card inserted</strong> devices. During that time, the Honor Play 8T device will be network- or SIM-locked, prohibiting the user from changing service providers.</p><p>The user cannot change the SIM. The service provider will offer the SIM Unlock code needed to unlock the handset when the contract expires. The gadget can be used with any other SIM card and exported to another country without problems when the network lock has been removed.</p><p><strong>Region Lock</strong></p><p>Apple and AT&amp;T initially worked together to implement the SIM lock and the SIM locked devices. The original purpose was to force the user to continue using the same service provider in a specific area or time.</p><p>However, some telecom service providers sell the handsets with select data plans as bundled plans in collaboration with the Honor Play 8T device manufacturers. As a result, the handset will cost less than it would otherwise. Sometimes, these offers are particular to a specific region, called a carrier lock.</p><p><strong>Firmware Problems</strong></p><p>Sometimes, the Honor Play 8T device manufacturers release many versions of the same firmware for different geographical locations.</p><p>As a result, it may be possible that the user may face contradictions in the agreement of device firmware and the network-locked SIM card that was supposed to be used on the Honor Play 8T device. Due to firmware problems, the users may also face a network-locked SIM card-inserted device.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/11/fix-network-locked-simcard-inserted-03.png"                      alt="unlock sim card"                ></p><h2 id="Part-3-How-to-Unlock-Network-Locked-SIM-Card-Inserted"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-Unlock-Network-Locked-SIM-Card-Inserted" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How to Unlock Network Locked SIM Card Inserted?"></a>Part 3: How to Unlock Network Locked SIM Card Inserted?</h2><p>Unlocking a network-locked SIM card may seem like a complex task.

It is a straightforward and reliable method to unlock your network-locked SIM card. Unlocking your network-locked SIM card through your carrier is a reliable and legal method. Before contacting your carrier, get information like your device’s IMEI number and account details. There are several ways to get in touch with your network carrier’s customer support.</p><p>You can call the customer support hotline, visit the website, or go to a physical store. The process usually involves receiving an unlock network code, which you need to use. Once you’ve entered the unlock code, your phone should display that it’s now unlocked. Test it with the new SIM card to ensure that it can make calls, send texts, and access mobile data without any issues.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://lightailing.sjv.io/c/5597632/1638364/17190" target="_top" id="1638364"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17190-1638364"                      border="0" alt="" width="1280" height="720"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1638364/17190"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Method-2-Use-Online-Unlock-Service-to-Unlock-Network-Locked-SIM"><a href="#Method-2-Use-Online-Unlock-Service-to-Unlock-Network-Locked-SIM" class="headerlink" title="Method 2.

This guarantees that the Honor Play 8T device is only being used with the original SIM card for each provider. This locking also has a lot of drawbacks because it is incompatible with any other SIM card.</p><ol><li>The phone cannot be used with other SIM cards if the SIM lock is enabled. Customers must therefore adhere to the current plan as is.</li><li>Since nobody wants to purchase a locked phone, it is hard for someone to sell or gift the mobile.</li><li>Traveling abroad with a SIM-locked phone could provide some challenges because you won’t be able to use a local SIM card on the phone while you’re there.</li></ol><p>All the problems can be fixed, and the SIM works in any nation with the removed SIM lock.</p><h3 id="Conclusion-2"><a href="#Conclusion-2" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h3><p>Any of the methods above can work to get around the prohibition against using other SIM cards with your Android handset.

If the unlocking code fails to work double check that the IMEI number you used is the correct one and ensure that you purchased that device from that carrier and then try again.</p><p><strong><em>Samsung Device Freezes during unlocking</em></strong></p><p>If your device freezes during the unlocking process it typically means that you entered wrong unlocking code too many times. In this case you need to contact the carrier for a Master Code.</p><p><strong><em>My LG device won’t unlock</em></strong></p><p>There are some LG models that cannot be unlocked. These models include LG U300, LG U310, LG U8180, LG U8330, LG U8120, LG U8360, LG U8380, LGU880, and LG U890. If your device is one of these it can’t be unlocked by your carrier.

You can find out if yours is by checking the Honor X7b device’s documentation. If you see the words “unlocked” on the initial receipt then you know that the Honor X7b device is not SIM locked.</p><p>Another easy way to find out is to ask your carrier if the Honor X7b device is locked on to their network. You can also just try inserting another carrier’s SIM into your device. If it doesn’t work, you will know that the Honor X7b device is SIM locked.</p><p>If you bought your device from a third party re-seller such as Amazon you are more likely to be in possession of an unlocked device.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://boody-eco-wear.pxf.io/c/5597632/1572622/13846" target="_top" id="1572622"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/13846-1572622"                      border="0" alt="" width="1000" height="1298"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1572622/13846"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-SIM-Unlock-your-Android-Device"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-SIM-Unlock-your-Android-Device" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to SIM Unlock your Android Device"></a>Part 2: How to SIM Unlock your Android Device</h2><p>If you find that your SIM is locked, here’s a few things you can do to unlock the Honor X7b device.</p><p>Avoid all of the apps on the Google Play Store that promise to unlock your device, most of them don’t work and may even harbour a lot of Trojans and malware that will cause further problems for you and your device.</p><p>There are safe and very legal ways to unlock your device. Just try one of the following.</p><p><strong><em>Ask your Carrier to Unlock your Device</em></strong></p><p>This is the best option when you want to safely unlock your device. By February 2015, American cell phone owners got the option to request their carriers to unlock their device for them. Before that the law didn’t allow for carriers to unlock SIM cards in the United States. This unpopular law was reversed following a similar move by the European Union in 2013. The same law also requires that the carriers inform customers every month whether their device is eligible for unlocking.</p><p>If your device is eligible for unlocking, all you need to do is contact the carrier provide and request for the <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/unlock/unlock-samsung-sim-network-unlock-pin.html" >sim network unlock pin <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. But if your Smartphone was bought on a contract, you may need to pay a termination fee to break the contract of you want to unlock the Honor X7b device before the contact term expires. For Smartphones that are not on contract, you have to wait 12 months from the date of purchase and ensure that your bill is paid before the carrier can give you the unlock code.</p><p><strong><em>How to Unlock your Android Phone</em></strong></p><p>To begin with, you need to confirm your IMEI number. Dial *#06# on your device and the IMEI number will appear on the screen. Copy this number to a secure location or wrote it down somewhere.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2016/06/14670084741192.jpg"                      alt="How to Unlock your Android Phone"                ></p><p>The next step is to find a reputable service that will unlock your Android device for you. This is action you should take only if you are absolutely desperate and your carrier can’t unlock your device for you. This is because many of these sites are unregulated and many of them are not reliable.</p><p>You should also know that many of them will charge a certain amount for your service. You can try <a class="link"   href="https://www.safeunlockcode.com/" >https://www.safeunlockcode.com/ <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> which is one of the more reputable ones we have found.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2016/06/14670084936436.jpg"                      alt="android SIM unlock-safeunlockcode"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4620778&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/07dd4d5a72f5740ef0f035f201951476/728__90banner.jpg"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>You will need to enter the IMEI number as part of the information you need to provide before they can unlock your device.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4615471&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/affiliate-image/affiliate_banners_en/max_782x90.png"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-3-Troubleshooting-Android-SIM-Unlock"><a href="#Part-3-Troubleshooting-Android-SIM-Unlock" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Troubleshooting Android SIM Unlock"></a>Part 3: Troubleshooting Android SIM Unlock</h2><p>There are lots of issues you may face when you try to unlock your device. The following are just some of the troubleshooting actions you can take if you encounter these problems.</p><p><strong><em>Unlocking Code Fails to work</em></strong></p><p>If you asked your carrier to unlock your device for you, chances are that they sent you a code. If the unlocking code fails to work double check that the IMEI number you used is the correct one and ensure that you purchased that device from that carrier and then try again.</p><p><strong><em>Samsung Device Freezes during unlocking</em></strong></p><p>If your device freezes during the unlocking process it typically means that you entered wrong unlocking code too many times. In this case you need to contact the carrier for a Master Code.</p><p><strong><em>My LG device won’t unlock</em></strong></p><p>There are some LG models that cannot be unlocked. These models include LG U300, LG U310, LG U8180, LG U8330, LG U8120, LG U8360, LG U8380, LGU880, and LG U890. If your device is one of these it can’t be unlocked by your carrier. You may need to look into other ways of unlocking your device.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"

Benefits of Using Android SIM Unlock Code Generator"></a>Part 3. Benefits of Using Android SIM Unlock Code Generator</h2><p>There are several benefits of using Android SIM unlock code generator. Some of these benefits are:</p><ul><li><strong>1. Freedom to choose your carrier</strong></li></ul><p>When your phone is carrier locked, you are limited to using only the carrier that the phone is locked to. This can be a problem if you travel frequently or want to switch to a different carrier. By unlocking your phone’s SIM card, you will be able to use any carrier’s SIM card, giving you the freedom to choose the carrier that best suits your needs.</p><ul><li><strong>2. Cost savings</strong></li></ul><p>By unlocking your phone’s SIM card, you can save money on roaming charges when traveling. Instead of paying expensive roaming charges, you can simply purchase a local SIM card and use it in your unlocked phone. This can save you a lot of money in the long run.</p><ul><li><strong>3. Resale value</strong></li></ul><p>An unlocked phone has a higher resale value than a carrier-locked phone. This is because an unlocked phone can be used with any carrier’s SIM card, making it more attractive to buyers.</p><ul><li><strong>4. No need to buy a new phone</strong></li></ul><p>If you want to switch to a different carrier, you may be tempted to buy a new phone that is compatible with that carrier. However, by unlocking your phone’s SIM card, you can use your existing phone with any carrier’s SIM card, saving you the cost of buying a new phone.</p><h2 id="Part-4-4-Android-SIM-Unlock-Code-Generators-Reviews"><a href="#Part-4-4-Android-SIM-Unlock-Code-Generators-Reviews" class="headerlink" title="Part 4. 4 Android SIM Unlock Code Generators Reviews"></a>Part 4. 4 Android SIM Unlock Code Generators Reviews</h2><p>There are several Android SIM unlock code generator software available on the internet.

Phones are our life source in this global age, it’s our tether to reality, to the world! But if you have a carrier locked phone, then that connection is basically under contract by an external agency! You can’t change your networks, there are limitations on how you use your phone, and when you have to travel abroad you have no option other than paying the roaming charges. If you, say, have an iPhone 5c and have these frustrations, it’s likely you’re already wondering how to unlock the iPhone 5c.</p><p>Chances are that if you’ve had a carrier locked phone for a while, you might have already forgotten what cellular freedom feels like. But we’re here to remind you. All you have to do is break that carrier-lock, and you’re good to go. However, you should be careful when doing so, cause if you try using a jailbreaking technique, it could have major repercussions. So we’re here to give you some valuable advice about how to unlock iPhone 5, iPhone 5c, or even Android phones.</p><h2 id="Part-1-Unlock-SIM-Card-on-ZTE-Nubia-Z60-Ultra-via-jailbreak"><a href="#Part-1-Unlock-SIM-Card-on-ZTE-Nubia-Z60-Ultra-via-jailbreak" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Unlock SIM Card on ZTE Nubia Z60 Ultra via jailbreak"></a>Part 1: Unlock SIM Card on ZTE Nubia Z60 Ultra via jailbreak</h2><p>Before we get into telling you how to unlock iPhone 5, or the SIM Card on iPhone or Android, we should first tell you what Jailbreaking is. You might have heard of this term before, and I’m sure it sounded ominous to you. Jailbreak? It sounds awfully close to ‘Prison break.’ Well, considering the carrier lock is sort of like a prison for your cell, it is an accurate terminology. But Jailbreak isn’t just about breaking the carrier lock. That might happen as a by-product, but the real purpose is to break free of the software restrictions which are generally applied to Apple devices. This might seem like a good option because, well, who doesn’t want to break free of all of Apple’s restrictions? But that always comes at several heavy risks.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://shop.systoolsgroup.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=SYSTOOBY&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.systoolsgroup.com%3FAFFILIATE%3D108875%26RESOURCE%3D%2BSysTools%2BPDF%2BUnlocker"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.systoolsgroup.com/box/pdf-unlocker.png"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Threats-of-unlocking-SIM-via-Jailbreak"><a href="#Threats-of-unlocking-SIM-via-Jailbreak" class="headerlink" title="Threats of unlocking SIM via Jailbreak"></a>Threats of unlocking SIM via Jailbreak</h3><h4 id="1-Not-Permanent"><a href="#1-Not-Permanent" class="headerlink" title="1. Not Permanent"></a>1. Not Permanent</h4><p>This has got to be one of the biggest reasons for not jailbreaking your phone. It is not at all permanent! In fact, the moment you update your system, your jailbreak is lost and if you’ve started using a different SIM it will no longer function, and you’re gonna have to go back to using that Carrier you tried so hard to escape from! It’s really not worth the effort. Of course, you could stop updating altogether, but then that will bring us to…</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2016/10/14771444107532.jpg"                      alt="Unlock SIM Card on iPhone and Android via jailbreak"                ></p><h4 id="2-Risky"><a href="#2-Risky" class="headerlink" title="2. Risky"></a>2. Risky</h4><p>If you don’t update your iOS, or Mac or iPad or any device at all, in this day and age, you’re basically just asking to be hacked. That is not to excuse those who do the hacking and plant malware on your system, but if you leave your front door open in a shitty neighborhood, well then you only have yourself to blame once you get robbed!</p><h4 id="3-Warranty"><a href="#3-Warranty" class="headerlink" title="3. Warranty"></a>3. Warranty</h4><p>Jailbreaking has now become kind-of-legal, in a very tenuous sense, but that doesn’t mean Apple wholeheartedly welcomes jailbreaking. If you do so, you will never again be able to avail of the warranty on your phone. And with the kind of major bucks you have to shell out for those iPhones, you best keep that warranty intact.</p><h4 id="4-Lack-of-Apps"><a href="#4-Lack-of-Apps" class="headerlink" title="4. Lack of Apps"></a>4. Lack of Apps</h4><p>Many top-notch and crucial app companies and organizations simply refuse to make their applications usable in jailbreak phones, as they are extremely risky and prone to hacking. As a result, you would have to rely on a bunch of non-professional apps made by amateurs, which is more likely to put your phone in harm’s way.</p><h4 id="5-Bricking"><a href="#5-Bricking" class="headerlink" title="5. Bricking"></a>5. Bricking</h4><p>This basically means your whole system may crash and stop functioning. As a result, you’re gonna’ have to restore the whole thing and try to salvage whatever information you can. Now those who do jailbreak regularly will give you all kinds of excuses like it happens only rarely or that you can retrieve your data simply from the cloud, et al. But do you really want to divest all your time and energy trying to fight off malware, backing up all your data, etc, especially when there is a much more convenient option just around the corner?</p><p>Didn’t think so.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://caperobbin.sjv.io/c/5597632/2006123/18460" target="_top" id="2006123"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18460-2006123"                      border="0" alt="" width="300" height="250"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/2006123/18460"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-unlock-SIM-Card-on-iPhone-without-jailbreak-Bonus"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-unlock-SIM-Card-on-iPhone-without-jailbreak-Bonus" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to unlock SIM Card on iPhone without jailbreak[Bonus]"></a>Part 2: How to unlock SIM Card on iPhone without jailbreak[Bonus]</h2><p>As mentioned above, unlocking by jailbreaking is risky and only temporary.

But your phone pops up with a request for a PIN code to unlock it. What’s that all about, and what do you enter? There are two main reasons why your phone might be asking for a SIM PIN or unlock code:</p><p>SIM Network Lock</p><p>The SIM Network Lock is a restriction placed by your phone’s original network provider, locking it to their network. It means you can only use the Xiaomi Redmi 12 5G device with SIM cards from that specific carrier. Carriers use this to ensure that the phones they sell work only with their service. When you buy a subsidized phone, they want to ensure you stick around for the contract duration.</p><p>If you insert a SIM card from a different carrier, your phone will ask for a <strong>SIM Network Unlock PIN</strong> or Network Unlock Code (NUC). You’ll learn more about it in the upcoming sections of this article.</p><p>SIM Card Lock</p><p>SIM Card Lock is a security feature that protects your SIM card from unauthorized use on other devices. It requires you to enter a PIN (Personal Identification Number) to unlock the SIM card before you can use it.</p><p>The default PIN is usually printed on the back of the SIM card or its packaging. If you haven’t changed your PIN, use the 4-8 digit code provided by the carrier when you get your SIM card.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/02/sim-network-unlock-pin-02.jpg"                      alt="sim card lock pin"                ></p><p>If you’ve forgotten the <strong>SIM PIN code</strong>, you can use the PUK (PIN Unlock Key) code to unlock the SIM and set a new PIN. The PUK code is also printed on the SIM card packaging, but be careful, as entering the wrong PUK code too many times can permanently lock the SIM card.</p><p>Not knowing the <strong>SIM unlock PIN</strong> code can be frustrating, especially if you want to switch mobile carriers. So, in the next part, we’ll explore whether it’s possible to unlock a SIM network-locked iPhone device.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.textstudio.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=35633281&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"> <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/d6eb8222c9718486bdabce8b897380f7/products/2_premium-icon.png"                      border="0"                > Take advantage of PREMIUM features.<br>Create your texts &#x2F; logos without any limitation.<br>No attribution required when downloading.<br>No advertising on the website.<br> TextStudio.com  PREMIUM - Monthly Membership</a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-2-Can-a-SIM-Network-Locked-iPhone-Be-Unlocked"><a href="#Part-2-Can-a-SIM-Network-Locked-iPhone-Be-Unlocked" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Can a SIM Network Locked iPhone Be Unlocked?"></a>Part 2: Can a SIM Network Locked iPhone Be Unlocked?</h2><p>Yes, a SIM network-locked iPhone can be unlocked by your network provider.

You cannot escape the carriers once you begin using a cell phone.</p><p>Customers can purchase a new handset via carriers or the mobile phone market. You may need an unlocked phone if you wish to use a different carrier’s service on your smartphone. However, if you want a gadget linked to a specific SIM card, you may buy one from the carriers for a reduced price.</p><h2 id="Part-1-What-Does-It-Mean-If-Your-Honor-90-Pro-Asks-for-SIM-Network-PIN"><a href="#Part-1-What-Does-It-Mean-If-Your-Honor-90-Pro-Asks-for-SIM-Network-PIN" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What Does It Mean If Your Honor 90 Pro Asks for SIM Network PIN?"></a>Part 1: What Does It Mean If Your Honor 90 Pro Asks for SIM Network PIN?</h2><p>When your phone prompts you to enter a SIM Network Unlock PIN, it means that your device is currently locked to a specific mobile network carrier, and it can only be used with SIM cards from that carrier. This locking mechanism is usually put in place by the carrier or the phone manufacturer to ensure that you continue to use their services, typically for the duration of a contract. As a result, your phone cannot be freely used with SIM cards from other carriers until it’s unlocked using the correct PIN or code.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/11/fix-network-locked-simcard-inserted-01.jpg"                      alt="sim locked"                ></p><h2 id="Part-2-Why-Does-Your-Honor-90-Pro-Say-Invalid-SIM-Card-–-Network-Locked-SIM-Card-Inserted"><a href="#Part-2-Why-Does-Your-Honor-90-Pro-Say-Invalid-SIM-Card-–-Network-Locked-SIM-Card-Inserted" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Why Does Your Honor 90 Pro Say Invalid SIM Card – Network Locked SIM Card Inserted?"></a>Part 2: Why Does Your Honor 90 Pro Say Invalid SIM Card – Network Locked SIM Card Inserted?</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/11/fix-network-locked-simcard-inserted-2.jpg"                      alt="remove network lock"                ></p><p><strong>System Errors</strong></p><p>Since SIM locking is a smartphone restriction implemented to stop it from being used on other networks, Android system errors can cause network-locked SIM cards. Resetting these errors can help unlock your <strong>network locked SIM card inserted</strong> device. Service providers decided to provide a formal SIM unlocking option as a result.</p><p>Because of this, any locked SIM may be readily unlocked, and once a device opens, it can work like a conventional mobile phone and with any SIM card of the user’s choosing.</p><p><strong>Carrier Lock</strong></p><p>The consumer must stick with the same service provider for a specific time after purchasing the bundled device and data pack. This is called a carrier lock on the Honor 90 Pro device and is one of the most common errors in <strong>network locked SIM card inserted</strong> devices. During that time, the Honor 90 Pro device will be network- or SIM-locked, prohibiting the user from changing service providers.</p><p>The user cannot change the SIM. The service provider will offer the SIM Unlock code needed to unlock the handset when the contract expires. The gadget can be used with any other SIM card and exported to another country without problems when the network lock has been removed.</p><p><strong>Region Lock</strong></p><p>Apple and AT&amp;T initially worked together to implement the SIM lock and the SIM locked devices. The original purpose was to force the user to continue using the same service provider in a specific area or time.</p><p>However, some telecom service providers sell the handsets with select data plans as bundled plans in collaboration with the Honor 90 Pro device manufacturers. As a result, the handset will cost less than it would otherwise. Sometimes, these offers are particular to a specific region, called a carrier lock.</p><p><strong>Firmware Problems</strong></p><p>Sometimes, the Honor 90 Pro device manufacturers release many versions of the same firmware for different geographical locations.</p><p>As a result, it may be possible that the user may face contradictions in the agreement of device firmware and the network-locked SIM card that was supposed to be used on the Honor 90 Pro device. Due to firmware problems, the users may also face a network-locked SIM card-inserted device.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/11/fix-network-locked-simcard-inserted-03.png"                      alt="unlock sim card"                ></p><h2 id="Part-3-How-to-Unlock-Network-Locked-SIM-Card-Inserted"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-Unlock-Network-Locked-SIM-Card-Inserted" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How to Unlock Network Locked SIM Card Inserted?"></a>Part 3: How to Unlock Network Locked SIM Card Inserted?</h2><p>Unlocking a network-locked SIM card may seem like a complex task.

Unlike the PIN you use to unlock your phone, the SIM PIN code is a separate layer of security. If someone tries to use your SIM card in another phone without the correct PIN, they won’t be able to access your network or data.</p><p>Here are more reasons why <strong>changing the PIN code of a SIM card</strong> is a smart move:</p><ul><li>Default PINs are easy to guess</li></ul><p>Most carriers use generic PINs like “1234” or “0000”. Change it to something unique and harder to crack.</p><ul><li>Protects data in case of loss or theft</li></ul><p>If you lose your phone or it gets stolen, a strong PIN code hinders the thief’s ability to make calls, send messages, or access your data stored on the SIM. It buys you time to report the loss and block your SIM card before they can do any damage.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/02/how-to-change-pin-on-android-phone-02.jpg"                      alt="sim card locked"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://purchase.swifdoo.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=38709260&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/8b932759a5a04ddb34bf79e3f9072e4b/products/Product%20box%20white-1024x1024.png"                      border="0"                >SwifDoo PDF Perpetual (2-PC)  Free upgrade. No monthly fees ever. </a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><ul><li>Prevents accidental PIN lockouts</li></ul><p>Using a memorable PIN minimizes the risk of accidentally locking yourself out of your SIM card.</p><ul><li>Peace of mind</li></ul><p>It is crucial if you store sensitive info on your SIM or use your phone for work.

Thankfully, Android allows you to easily change your SIM card PIN to a more personal and memorable code. But before you begin:</p><ul><li>Contact your network carrier to get your PUK code if you already have it. You’ll need this if you enter the wrong PIN three times and lock your SIM card.</li><li>Remember the temporary default PIN: Most SIM cards have a default PIN, often 1234 or 0123. If you haven’t changed it, this is the PIN you’ll use initially.</li></ul><p><strong>Note:</strong></p><p>Entering the wrong PIN three times will lock your SIM card. You’ll need your network carrier’s PUK code to unlock it. Use it cautiously, as exceeding the maximum number of attempts will permanently block your SIM card. So, it’s best to memorize your PIN or store it securely to avoid relying on the PUK altogether.</p><p>Steps To Change Your SIM PIN</p><p>Here’s <strong>how to find and manage the SIM PIN code on Android</strong>:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Navigate to your phone’s <strong>Settings</strong> app. Next, look for the <strong>Security and privacy</strong> or <strong>Lock screen and security</strong> (or other similar option) depending on your device’s model.</li><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Scroll down and tap on <strong>More security settings</strong> or <strong>Other security settings</strong>.</li><li><strong>Step 3:</strong> Tap <strong>SIM card security</strong> or <strong>Set up SIM card lock</strong> (or something similar).</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/02/how-to-change-pin-on-android-phone-03.jpg"                      alt="sim card security in settings"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://order.glarysoft.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4691139&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/6734fa703f6633ab896eecbdfad8953a/products/SU-200-1.png"                      border="0"                >Software Update Pro - Check and update software installed on your computer. </a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><ul><li><strong>Step 4:</strong> If you have multiple SIMs, select the one you want to change the PIN code.</li><li><strong>Step 5:</strong> Tap <strong>Change SIM PIN</strong>.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/02/how-to-change-pin-on-android-phone-04.jpg"                      alt="change sim pin code on android"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Step 6:</strong> Input your current SIM card PIN code and tap <strong>OK</strong>.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/02/how-to-change-pin-on-android-phone-05.jpg"                      alt="enter old sim pin"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4621764&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.x-mirage.com/x-mirage/img/page-home.jpg"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><ul><li><strong>Step 7:</strong> Enter your desired new PIN code and tap <strong>OK</strong>.</li><li><strong>Step 8:</strong> Re-enter your new SIM card PIN code and tap <strong>OK</strong> to confirm.</li></ul><p>Success!

But for iPhone users, forgetting it can lock you out. So, what should you do if you <strong>lose the SIM PIN</strong> code on iOS?</p><p>First, avoid guessing your SIM PIN or PUK code.

Freedom to choose your carrier</strong></li></ul><p>When your phone is carrier locked, you are limited to using only the carrier that the phone is locked to. This can be a problem if you travel frequently or want to switch to a different carrier. By unlocking your phone’s SIM card, you will be able to use any carrier’s SIM card, giving you the freedom to choose the carrier that best suits your needs.</p><ul><li><strong>2. Cost savings</strong></li></ul><p>By unlocking your phone’s SIM card, you can save money on roaming charges when traveling. Instead of paying expensive roaming charges, you can simply purchase a local SIM card and use it in your unlocked phone. This can save you a lot of money in the long run.</p><ul><li><strong>3. Resale value</strong></li></ul><p>An unlocked phone has a higher resale value than a carrier-locked phone. This is because an unlocked phone can be used with any carrier’s SIM card, making it more attractive to buyers.</p><ul><li><strong>4. No need to buy a new phone</strong></li></ul><p>If you want to switch to a different carrier, you may be tempted to buy a new phone that is compatible with that carrier.

You loved the Tecno Pova 5 Pro device but your network provider does not have any plans that exactly suit your needs. To release your device from your current network’s clutches, you will need to unlock your phone.</p><p>There are three ways you can do it and this post will go through each method so that you can find one that you are most comfortable with. Do note that if your contract has ended with your network provider, this “How to unlock Tecno Pova 5 Pro” post can be skipped as you can just ask them to unlock your phone or purchase a <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/unlock/unlock-samsung-sim-network-unlock-pin.html" >sim network unlock pin <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> for a minimal price.</p><h2 id="Part-1-Tecno-Pova-5-Pro-Unlock-Code"><a href="#Part-1-Tecno-Pova-5-Pro-Unlock-Code" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Tecno Pova 5 Pro Unlock Code"></a>Part 1: Tecno Pova 5 Pro Unlock Code</h2><p>This is probably the easiest, no-fuss method to <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/unlock-android-screen/" >sim unlock <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> Tecno Pova 5 Pro. Follow these steps carefully to successfully perform Tecno Pova 5 Pro unlock code.</p><p>Do take note that this process may not work with your carrier. Therefore, always check if this is the right way to obtain the necessary code:</p><ul><li>1. Check the SIM lock status—you can do this by dialing <strong>*#*#7378423#*#*</strong>.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2016/08/14707989592943.jpg"                      alt="sony xperia unlock code"                ></p><ul><li>2.

The number beside <strong>Network</strong> indicates how many attempts you have to unlock the phone. If it says ‘7’ it means you have seven attempts; ‘0’ simply means it is hard locked and cannot be unlocked using this method.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2016/08/14707989597664.jpg"                      alt="unlock code sony xperia"                ></p><ul><li>4. Find the <strong>IMEI number</strong> by dialing <strong>*#06#</strong>. Jot it down as this will be your code.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2016/08/14707998453087.jpg"                      alt="sony unlock code"                ></p><ul><li>5. Insert your new SIM card and tap in the IMEI number when it asks you for SIM network unlock PIN.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2016/08/unlock-screen.jpg"                      alt="sony unlock screen"                ></p><p>If you have followed these steps to a tee, you should have unlocked your device.

Actually, it is the safest method among all three:</p><ol><li>Get a new SIM card from a new carrier.</li><li>Call your carrier’s customer service line and ask what are the requirements to qualify you to get your Tecno Pova 5 Pro unlocked. If you have honored your contract, there should not be any problems. However, do ask your carrier if there are any additional requirements. Do note that there may be fees involved.</li><li>Once your customer service representative has determined if you have met all their requirements, they should give you the SIM network unlock PIN Tecno Pova 5 Pro. Again, depending on your carrier, they might either give you the code over the phone, through email or via SMS.

Follow these steps carefully to successfully perform Realme C55 unlock code.</p><p>Do take note that this process may not work with your carrier. Therefore, always check if this is the right way to obtain the necessary code:</p><ul><li>1. Check the SIM lock status—you can do this by dialing <strong>*#*#7378423#*#*</strong>.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2016/08/14707989592943.jpg"                      alt="sony xperia unlock code"                ></p><ul><li>2.

Actually, it is the safest method among all three:</p><ol><li>Get a new SIM card from a new carrier.</li><li>Call your carrier’s customer service line and ask what are the requirements to qualify you to get your Realme C55 unlocked. If you have honored your contract, there should not be any problems. However, do ask your carrier if there are any additional requirements. Do note that there may be fees involved.</li><li>Once your customer service representative has determined if you have met all their requirements, they should give you the SIM network unlock PIN Realme C55. Again, depending on your carrier, they might either give you the code over the phone, through email or via SMS. If you have the choice, always opt for email or SMS so that you are able to jot down the right number.</li><li>Once you have gotten the code, insert the new SIM card (from your new carrier). You will receive a prompt to enter your code. Make sure that you key in the right code—entering the wrong code will cause your phone to be locked (possibly forever).</li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2016/08/unlock-screen.jpg"                      alt="sony unlock screen"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://shop.systoolsgroup.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=SYSTOOBY&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.systoolsgroup.com%3FAFFILIATE%3D108875%26RESOURCE%3DSysTools%2BGmail%2BBackup"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.systoolsgroup.com/box/gmail-backup.png"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-4-Realme-C55-Unlock-App-Software"><a href="#Part-4-Realme-C55-Unlock-App-Software" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: Realme C55 Unlock App&#x2F;Software"></a>Part 4: Realme C55 Unlock App&#x2F;Software</h2><p>There are some of us out there who are just not confident with doing things ourselves or trusting our own carrier.</p><p>HOWEVER, if your first instinct is to head to Google Play to look for SIM unlock tools, heed these cautions.

Therefore, if you travel frequently around the world, having an unlocked Realme C55 would be beneficial. Using a local SIM card is much cheaper than paying for exorbitant roaming charges.</p><p>You can also benefit from an unlocked Realme C55 if you are the kind of person who likes to take advantage of current offers provided by your local carriers. Prepaid plans are always changing in terms of offering so having the flexibility of changing carriers and prepaid plans can help you save money in the long run.</p><h2 id="Part-6-The-downside-of-an-unlocked-Realme-C55"><a href="#Part-6-The-downside-of-an-unlocked-Realme-C55" class="headerlink" title="Part 6: The downside of an unlocked Realme C55"></a>Part 6: The downside of an unlocked Realme C55</h2><p>Are you thinking “Well, why can’t I just buy an unlocked Realme C55 in the first place?” right about now? Well, you can but think of the amount of money it will cost you.</p><p>For example, in Australia, an unlocked Realme C55 will cost around $499 from any Realme outlet but $0 for the Realme C55 device when you pair it with a 24-month postpaid plan. While this may look attractive now, you may be paying more for a locked Realme C55 in the long run.</p><h2 id="Conclusion-1"><a href="#Conclusion-1" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>Now that you know the three ways of unlocking your Realme C55, all you need to do is find one that is most compatible with you.

Most importantly, if you have a locked device, always seek advice from your carrier to see if this is possible.</p><h2 id="Top-IMEI-Unlokers-for-Your-Realme-C55-Phone"><a href="#Top-IMEI-Unlokers-for-Your-Realme-C55-Phone" class="headerlink" title="Top IMEI Unlokers for Your Realme C55 Phone"></a>Top IMEI Unlokers for Your Realme C55 Phone</h2><p>Anytime your device is locked for one reason or another, IMEI unlocking is often the easiest way to unlock the Realme C55 device.
