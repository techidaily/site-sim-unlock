Benefits of Using Android SIM Unlock Code Generator"></a>Part 3. Benefits of Using Android SIM Unlock Code Generator</h2><p>There are several benefits of using Android SIM unlock code generator. Some of these benefits are:</p><ul><li><strong>1. Freedom to choose your carrier</strong></li></ul><p>When your phone is carrier locked, you are limited to using only the carrier that the phone is locked to. This can be a problem if you travel frequently or want to switch to a different carrier. By unlocking your phone’s SIM card, you will be able to use any carrier’s SIM card, giving you the freedom to choose the carrier that best suits your needs.</p><ul><li><strong>2. Cost savings</strong></li></ul><p>By unlocking your phone’s SIM card, you can save money on roaming charges when traveling. Instead of paying expensive roaming charges, you can simply purchase a local SIM card and use it in your unlocked phone. This can save you a lot of money in the long run.</p><ul><li><strong>3. Resale value</strong></li></ul><p>An unlocked phone has a higher resale value than a carrier-locked phone. This is because an unlocked phone can be used with any carrier’s SIM card, making it more attractive to buyers.</p><ul><li><strong>4. No need to buy a new phone</strong></li></ul><p>If you want to switch to a different carrier, you may be tempted to buy a new phone that is compatible with that carrier. However, by unlocking your phone’s SIM card, you can use your existing phone with any carrier’s SIM card, saving you the cost of buying a new phone.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a class="link"   href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4729642&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1" >Advanced Find and Replace for Google Sheets, Lifetime subscription <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-4-4-Android-SIM-Unlock-Code-Generators-Reviews"><a href="#Part-4-4-Android-SIM-Unlock-Code-Generators-Reviews" class="headerlink" title="Part 4. 4 Android SIM Unlock Code Generators Reviews"></a>Part 4. 4 Android SIM Unlock Code Generators Reviews</h2><p>There are several Android SIM unlock code generator software available on the internet.

This will save you from long-term hassle as you will have the freedom to switch carriers and SIM cards whenever you like. On the other hand, if we talk about locked phones, they’re expensive and a headache to deal with because of the requirements and problems they come with.</p><p>If you’re concerned about a dual-SIM phone, then you can have one SIM pinned to a good quality carrier. The other SIM can be temporary and cheap. This is an amazing option for you if you’re traveling, as you’ll have the flexibility to change carriers for the temporary SIM no matter wherever you are.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://imp.i357552.net/c/5597632/863035/11832" target="_top" id="863035">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/11832-863035" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.i357552.net/i/5597632/863035/11832"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end -->## Conclusion<p>As a crux, an unlocked phone is a better choice than a locked phone. We would personally advise you to go for unlocked phones as this will save your time and money. You will have much more freedom and flexibility for changing between SIM and SIM carriers. Whereas on the locked phones, you will be bound to one SIM.

Benefits of Using Android SIM Unlock Code Generator"></a>Part 3. Benefits of Using Android SIM Unlock Code Generator</h2><p>There are several benefits of using Android SIM unlock code generator. Some of these benefits are:</p><ul><li><strong>1. Freedom to choose your carrier</strong></li></ul><p>When your phone is carrier locked, you are limited to using only the carrier that the phone is locked to. This can be a problem if you travel frequently or want to switch to a different carrier. By unlocking your phone’s SIM card, you will be able to use any carrier’s SIM card, giving you the freedom to choose the carrier that best suits your needs.</p><ul><li><strong>2. Cost savings</strong></li></ul><p>By unlocking your phone’s SIM card, you can save money on roaming charges when traveling. Instead of paying expensive roaming charges, you can simply purchase a local SIM card and use it in your unlocked phone. This can save you a lot of money in the long run.</p><ul><li><strong>3. Resale value</strong></li></ul><p>An unlocked phone has a higher resale value than a carrier-locked phone. This is because an unlocked phone can be used with any carrier’s SIM card, making it more attractive to buyers.</p><ul><li><strong>4. No need to buy a new phone</strong></li></ul><p>If you want to switch to a different carrier, you may be tempted to buy a new phone that is compatible with that carrier. However, by unlocking your phone’s SIM card, you can use your existing phone with any carrier’s SIM card, saving you the cost of buying a new phone.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=30901369&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"> <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/ce9a6fb2becc2d235e62b125e9260102/products/1_copy_vMixCallScreenshot1-large.jpg"                      border="0"                > vMix 4K - Software based live production. vMix 4K includes everything in vMix HD plus 4K support, PTZ control, External&#x2F;Fullscreen output, 4 Virtual Outputs, 1 Replay, 4 vMix Call, and 2 Recorders.<br>This bundle includes Studio 200 for vMix from Virtualsetworks, HTTP Matrix 1.0 automation scheduler, and 4 introductory training videos from the Udemy vMix Basic to Amazing course. </a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-4-4-Android-SIM-Unlock-Code-Generators-Reviews"><a href="#Part-4-4-Android-SIM-Unlock-Code-Generators-Reviews" class="headerlink" title="Part 4. 4 Android SIM Unlock Code Generators Reviews"></a>Part 4. 4 Android SIM Unlock Code Generators Reviews</h2><p>There are several Android SIM unlock code generator software available on the internet.

Therefore, if you travel frequently around the world, having an unlocked Xiaomi 14 Ultra would be beneficial. Using a local SIM card is much cheaper than paying for exorbitant roaming charges.</p><p>You can also benefit from an unlocked Xiaomi 14 Ultra if you are the kind of person who likes to take advantage of current offers provided by your local carriers. Prepaid plans are always changing in terms of offering so having the flexibility of changing carriers and prepaid plans can help you save money in the long run.</p><h2 id="Part-6-The-downside-of-an-unlocked-Xiaomi-14-Ultra"><a href="#Part-6-The-downside-of-an-unlocked-Xiaomi-14-Ultra" class="headerlink" title="Part 6: The downside of an unlocked Xiaomi 14 Ultra"></a>Part 6: The downside of an unlocked Xiaomi 14 Ultra</h2><p>Are you thinking “Well, why can’t I just buy an unlocked Xiaomi 14 Ultra in the first place?” right about now? Well, you can but think of the amount of money it will cost you.</p><p>For example, in Australia, an unlocked Xiaomi 14 Ultra will cost around $499 from any Xiaomi outlet but $0 for the Xiaomi 14 Ultra device when you pair it with a 24-month postpaid plan. While this may look attractive now, you may be paying more for a locked Xiaomi 14 Ultra in the long run.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1997722/19272" target="_top" id="1997722">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1997722" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1997722/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end -->## Conclusion<p>Now that you know the three ways of unlocking your Xiaomi 14 Ultra, all you need to do is find one that is most compatible with you.

This 4-digit code protects your phone number from unauthorized calls, texts, and data use. It’s essential to change the default PIN to one that’s both memorable for you and difficult for others to guess.</p><p>So, <strong>how to change the PIN on an Android phone</strong>’s SIM card? This article will provide a step-by-step guide to help you secure your data. But first, let’s explore why changing the default one is important.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/02/how-to-change-pin-on-android-phone-01.jpg"                      alt="a phone sim card"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://store.nero.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=39694080&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="http://cdnwww.nero.com/nero-com-wAssets/img/banners/2023/nbr/fire/Screenshot_1red_gb.jpg"                      border="0"                >Nero Burning ROM:<br>The ultimate burning program for all your needs!</a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-1-Why-Does-Changing-Your-SIM-PIN-Code-Matter-on-a-New-Phone"><a href="#Part-1-Why-Does-Changing-Your-SIM-PIN-Code-Matter-on-a-New-Phone" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Why Does Changing Your SIM PIN Code Matter on a New Phone?"></a>Part 1: Why Does Changing Your SIM PIN Code Matter on a New Phone?</h2><p>Your SIM PIN code acts as a password for your SIM card, which stores your phone number, contacts, and other essential data. Unlike the PIN you use to unlock your phone, the SIM PIN code is a separate layer of security. If someone tries to use your SIM card in another phone without the correct PIN, they won’t be able to access your network or data.</p><p>Here are more reasons why <strong>changing the PIN code of a SIM card</strong> is a smart move:</p><ul><li>Default PINs are easy to guess</li></ul><p>Most carriers use generic PINs like “1234” or “0000”. Change it to something unique and harder to crack.</p><ul><li>Protects data in case of loss or theft</li></ul><p>If you lose your phone or it gets stolen, a strong PIN code hinders the thief’s ability to make calls, send messages, or access your data stored on the SIM. It buys you time to report the loss and block your SIM card before they can do any damage.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/02/how-to-change-pin-on-android-phone-02.jpg"                      alt="sim card locked"                ></p><ul><li>Prevents accidental PIN lockouts</li></ul><p>Using a memorable PIN minimizes the risk of accidentally locking yourself out of your SIM card.</p><ul><li>Peace of mind</li></ul><p>It is crucial if you store sensitive info on your SIM or use your phone for work. Knowing about this extra safeguard is reassuring, ensuring your data stays protected.</p><p><strong>Remember:</strong></p><p>Choose a PIN code for your SIM that’s easy for you to remember but challenging for others to guess. Avoid using birthdays, anniversaries, or other easily identifiable information. By taking a few minutes to <strong>change the PIN code of the SIM card</strong>, you’ll gain a significant security advantage for your new phone and data.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-To-Change-Pin-on-Android-Phone-SIM-Cards"><a href="#Part-2-How-To-Change-Pin-on-Android-Phone-SIM-Cards" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How To Change Pin on Android Phone SIM Cards?"></a>Part 2: How To Change Pin on Android Phone SIM Cards?</h2><p>Keeping your SIM card secure is crucial for protecting your data and privacy. Thankfully, Android allows you to easily change your SIM card PIN to a more personal and memorable code. But before you begin:</p><ul><li>Contact your network carrier to get your PUK code if you already have it. You’ll need this if you enter the wrong PIN three times and lock your SIM card.</li><li>Remember the temporary default PIN: Most SIM cards have a default PIN, often 1234 or 0123. If you haven’t changed it, this is the PIN you’ll use initially.</li></ul><p><strong>Note:</strong></p><p>Entering the wrong PIN three times will lock your SIM card. You’ll need your network carrier’s PUK code to unlock it. Use it cautiously, as exceeding the maximum number of attempts will permanently block your SIM card. So, it’s best to memorize your PIN or store it securely to avoid relying on the PUK altogether.</p><p>Steps To Change Your SIM PIN</p><p>Here’s <strong>how to find and manage the SIM PIN code on Android</strong>:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Navigate to your phone’s <strong>Settings</strong> app. Next, look for the <strong>Security and privacy</strong> or <strong>Lock screen and security</strong> (or other similar option) depending on your device’s model.</li><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Scroll down and tap on <strong>More security settings</strong> or <strong>Other security settings</strong>.</li><li><strong>Step 3:</strong> Tap <strong>SIM card security</strong> or <strong>Set up SIM card lock</strong> (or something similar).</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/02/how-to-change-pin-on-android-phone-03.jpg"                      alt="sim card security in settings"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Step 4:</strong> If you have multiple SIMs, select the one you want to change the PIN code.</li><li><strong>Step 5:</strong> Tap <strong>Change SIM PIN</strong>.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/02/how-to-change-pin-on-android-phone-04.jpg"                      alt="change sim pin code on android"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Step 6:</strong> Input your current SIM card PIN code and tap <strong>OK</strong>.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/02/how-to-change-pin-on-android-phone-05.jpg"                      alt="enter old sim pin"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Step 7:</strong> Enter your desired new PIN code and tap <strong>OK</strong>.</li><li><strong>Step 8:</strong> Re-enter your new SIM card PIN code and tap <strong>OK</strong> to confirm.</li></ul><p>Success!

Now that you know <strong>how to change your PIN on an Android phone</strong> SIM card, you can change your PIN on Android and keep your data safe. But security goes beyond the PIN code. Enable additional protections like screen locks and two-factor authentication.</p><p>Don’t worry about forgetting your screen lock on Android. For advanced troubleshooting, Dr.Fone stands ready. And if you encounter SIM-related issues on an iOS device, such as “SIM not supported” or being “locked to a carrier,” as mentioned above, it can help you.

Just try one of the following.</p><p><strong><em>Ask your Carrier to Unlock your Device</em></strong></p><p>This is the best option when you want to safely unlock your device. By February 2015, American cell phone owners got the option to request their carriers to unlock their device for them. Before that the law didn’t allow for carriers to unlock SIM cards in the United States. This unpopular law was reversed following a similar move by the European Union in 2013. The same law also requires that the carriers inform customers every month whether their device is eligible for unlocking.</p><p>If your device is eligible for unlocking, all you need to do is contact the carrier provide and request for the <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/unlock/unlock-samsung-sim-network-unlock-pin.html" >sim network unlock pin <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. But if your Smartphone was bought on a contract, you may need to pay a termination fee to break the contract of you want to unlock the Realme 12 5G device before the contact term expires. For Smartphones that are not on contract, you have to wait 12 months from the date of purchase and ensure that your bill is paid before the carrier can give you the unlock code.</p><p><strong><em>How to Unlock your Android Phone</em></strong></p><p>To begin with, you need to confirm your IMEI number. Dial *#06# on your device and the IMEI number will appear on the screen. Copy this number to a secure location or wrote it down somewhere.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2016/06/14670084741192.jpg"                      alt="How to Unlock your Android Phone"                ></p><p>The next step is to find a reputable service that will unlock your Android device for you. This is action you should take only if you are absolutely desperate and your carrier can’t unlock your device for you. This is because many of these sites are unregulated and many of them are not reliable.</p><p>You should also know that many of them will charge a certain amount for your service. You can try <a class="link"   href="https://www.safeunlockcode.com/" >https://www.safeunlockcode.com/ <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> which is one of the more reputable ones we have found.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2016/06/14670084936436.jpg"                      alt="android SIM unlock-safeunlockcode"                ></p><p>You will need to enter the IMEI number as part of the information you need to provide before they can unlock your device.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Troubleshooting-Android-SIM-Unlock"><a href="#Part-3-Troubleshooting-Android-SIM-Unlock" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Troubleshooting Android SIM Unlock"></a>Part 3: Troubleshooting Android SIM Unlock</h2><p>There are lots of issues you may face when you try to unlock your device. The following are just some of the troubleshooting actions you can take if you encounter these problems.</p><p><strong><em>Unlocking Code Fails to work</em></strong></p><p>If you asked your carrier to unlock your device for you, chances are that they sent you a code. If the unlocking code fails to work double check that the IMEI number you used is the correct one and ensure that you purchased that device from that carrier and then try again.</p><p><strong><em>Samsung Device Freezes during unlocking</em></strong></p><p>If your device freezes during the unlocking process it typically means that you entered wrong unlocking code too many times. In this case you need to contact the carrier for a Master Code.</p><p><strong><em>My LG device won’t unlock</em></strong></p><p>There are some LG models that cannot be unlocked. These models include LG U300, LG U310, LG U8180, LG U8330, LG U8120, LG U8360, LG U8380, LGU880, and LG U890. If your device is one of these it can’t be unlocked by your carrier. You may need to look into other ways of unlocking your device.</p><h2 id="Ways-To-Find-Unlocking-Codes-For-Realme-12-5G-Phones"><a href="#Ways-To-Find-Unlocking-Codes-For-Realme-12-5G-Phones" class="headerlink" title="Ways To Find Unlocking Codes For Realme 12 5G Phones"></a>Ways To Find Unlocking Codes For Realme 12 5G Phones</h2><p>When you have a locked device, it is pretty much impossible to move from one network to another. This would cause problems if for instance you wanted to travel outside the country and want to switch to that country’s carrier for the duration of your stay. Or maybe you just want to switch carriers because you don’t like your current provider.</p><p>Whatever the reason, you should be able to unlock your device easily. But this has often proven difficult because of the fact that you need unlock codes. The problem is that many sites promise free unlocking codes for your device and many turn out to be fraudulent sites that use the word “free” in their advertising but actually require you to pay for the service. If you have been unsuccessfully searching for free unlocking codes for your device, look no further.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Network-Locked-SIM-Card-Inserted-On-Your-Realme-C51-Phone-Unlock-It-Now"><a href="#Network-Locked-SIM-Card-Inserted-On-Your-Realme-C51-Phone-Unlock-It-Now" class="headerlink" title="Network Locked SIM Card Inserted On Your Realme C51 Phone? Unlock It Now"></a>Network Locked SIM Card Inserted On Your Realme C51 Phone? Unlock It Now</h2><p>Carriers provide cellular connections so you can access the Internet, send text messages, and make phone calls without Wi-Fi. You cannot escape the carriers once you begin using a cell phone.</p><p>Customers can purchase a new handset via carriers or the mobile phone market. You may need an unlocked phone if you wish to use a different carrier’s service on your smartphone. However, if you want a gadget linked to a specific SIM card, you may buy one from the carriers for a reduced price.</p><h2 id="Part-1-What-Does-It-Mean-If-Your-Realme-C51-Asks-for-SIM-Network-PIN"><a href="#Part-1-What-Does-It-Mean-If-Your-Realme-C51-Asks-for-SIM-Network-PIN" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What Does It Mean If Your Realme C51 Asks for SIM Network PIN?"></a>Part 1: What Does It Mean If Your Realme C51 Asks for SIM Network PIN?</h2><p>When your phone prompts you to enter a SIM Network Unlock PIN, it means that your device is currently locked to a specific mobile network carrier, and it can only be used with SIM cards from that carrier. This locking mechanism is usually put in place by the carrier or the phone manufacturer to ensure that you continue to use their services, typically for the duration of a contract. As a result, your phone cannot be freely used with SIM cards from other carriers until it’s unlocked using the correct PIN or code.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/11/fix-network-locked-simcard-inserted-01.jpg"                      alt="sim locked"                ></p><h2 id="Part-2-Why-Does-Your-Realme-C51-Say-Invalid-SIM-Card-–-Network-Locked-SIM-Card-Inserted"><a href="#Part-2-Why-Does-Your-Realme-C51-Say-Invalid-SIM-Card-–-Network-Locked-SIM-Card-Inserted" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Why Does Your Realme C51 Say Invalid SIM Card – Network Locked SIM Card Inserted?"></a>Part 2: Why Does Your Realme C51 Say Invalid SIM Card – Network Locked SIM Card Inserted?</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/11/fix-network-locked-simcard-inserted-2.jpg"                      alt="remove network lock"                ></p><p><strong>System Errors</strong></p><p>Since SIM locking is a smartphone restriction implemented to stop it from being used on other networks, Android system errors can cause network-locked SIM cards. Resetting these errors can help unlock your <strong>network locked SIM card inserted</strong> device. Service providers decided to provide a formal SIM unlocking option as a result.</p><p>Because of this, any locked SIM may be readily unlocked, and once a device opens, it can work like a conventional mobile phone and with any SIM card of the user’s choosing.</p><p><strong>Carrier Lock</strong></p><p>The consumer must stick with the same service provider for a specific time after purchasing the bundled device and data pack. This is called a carrier lock on the Realme C51 device and is one of the most common errors in <strong>network locked SIM card inserted</strong> devices. During that time, the Realme C51 device will be network- or SIM-locked, prohibiting the user from changing service providers.</p><p>The user cannot change the SIM. The service provider will offer the SIM Unlock code needed to unlock the handset when the contract expires. The gadget can be used with any other SIM card and exported to another country without problems when the network lock has been removed.</p><p><strong>Region Lock</strong></p><p>Apple and AT&amp;T initially worked together to implement the SIM lock and the SIM locked devices. The original purpose was to force the user to continue using the same service provider in a specific area or time.</p><p>However, some telecom service providers sell the handsets with select data plans as bundled plans in collaboration with the Realme C51 device manufacturers. As a result, the handset will cost less than it would otherwise. Sometimes, these offers are particular to a specific region, called a carrier lock.</p><p><strong>Firmware Problems</strong></p><p>Sometimes, the Realme C51 device manufacturers release many versions of the same firmware for different geographical locations.</p><p>As a result, it may be possible that the user may face contradictions in the agreement of device firmware and the network-locked SIM card that was supposed to be used on the Realme C51 device. Due to firmware problems, the users may also face a network-locked SIM card-inserted device.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/11/fix-network-locked-simcard-inserted-03.png"                      alt="unlock sim card"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2097466/26400?prodsku=B700" target="_top" id="2097466"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2097466"                      border="0" alt="" width="2048" height="1024"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/2097466/26400"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-3-How-to-Unlock-Network-Locked-SIM-Card-Inserted"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-Unlock-Network-Locked-SIM-Card-Inserted" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How to Unlock Network Locked SIM Card Inserted?"></a>Part 3: How to Unlock Network Locked SIM Card Inserted?</h2><p>Unlocking a network-locked SIM card may seem like a complex task. However, it can be a straightforward process if you follow the right steps. In this section, we will guide you through the process of unlocking your network-locked SIM card. We will discuss 3 different ways you can unlock a <strong>network-locked SIM card inserted</strong>:</p><h3 id="Method-1-Contact-Network-Carrier-to-Unlock-Network-Locked-SIM"><a href="#Method-1-Contact-Network-Carrier-to-Unlock-Network-Locked-SIM" class="headerlink" title="Method 1. Contact Network Carrier to Unlock Network Locked SIM"></a>Method 1. Contact Network Carrier to Unlock Network Locked SIM</h3><p>Contacting your network carrier is often the most recommended choice. It is a straightforward and reliable method to unlock your network-locked SIM card. Unlocking your network-locked SIM card through your carrier is a reliable and legal method. Before contacting your carrier, get information like your device’s IMEI number and account details. There are several ways to get in touch with your network carrier’s customer support.</p><p>You can call the customer support hotline, visit the website, or go to a physical store. The process usually involves receiving an unlock network code, which you need to use. Once you’ve entered the unlock code, your phone should display that it’s now unlocked. Test it with the new SIM card to ensure that it can make calls, send texts, and access mobile data without any issues.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2068412/7443" target="_top" id="2068412">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2068412" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="1456" height="180"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2068412/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end -->### Method 2.

Your SIM locks itself after three to five wrong inputs, on average. Although it might be annoying, doing these guards against unauthorized access to your phone and personal data. If your cell phone is lost or stolen, PUK blocked will prevent prospective hackers from making calls.</p><p>Your mobile phone display can say “PIN blocked” or “Enter PUK code.” PUK stands for PIN Unblocking Key in the PUK code. The PUK code is seldom given to you when you receive your membership in the US. Contact Your Nubia Red Magic 9 Pro provider’s customer support if you don’t know your PUK code.</p><h2 id="Part-1-Why-Was-My-Sim-Card-Blocked"><a href="#Part-1-Why-Was-My-Sim-Card-Blocked" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Why Was My Sim Card Blocked?"></a>Part 1: Why Was My Sim Card Blocked?</h2><h3 id="1-3-times-incorrect-Pin-entered"><a href="#1-3-times-incorrect-Pin-entered" class="headerlink" title="1. 3 times incorrect Pin entered"></a>1. 3 times incorrect Pin entered</h3><p>Sometimes when you forget your pin and keep on entering the wrong one, you can get PUK Blocked. You can utilize three to five chances, and your sim gets blocked when you enter the incorrect pin in all of these attempts.</p><h3 id="2-Wrong-PUK-code-entered"><a href="#2-Wrong-PUK-code-entered" class="headerlink" title="2. Wrong PUK code entered"></a>2. Wrong PUK code entered</h3><p>Sims are frequently blocked; therefore, if you have your PUK, keep it in a secure location separate from your phone. This is because it is the key to unlocking your SIM. The SIM will be permanently disabled, and you will have to buy a new SIM card if you input the wrong PUK ten times in a row.</p><h2 id="Part-2-What-To-Do-When-I-Blocked-My-Sim-Card"><a href="#Part-2-What-To-Do-When-I-Blocked-My-Sim-Card" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: What To Do When I Blocked My Sim Card?"></a>Part 2: What To Do When I Blocked My Sim Card?</h2><p>Your SIM card has been disabled to protect your security if you enter three wrong PINs and your phone shows “SIM card banned” or “Enter PUK code”.</p><p>You must input a PUK (PIN Unlock Key) code to unlock your SIM card.</p><p>Go to your phone’s settings to customize your PIN code after using a PUK code to unlock your SIM card. Pick a PIN that is simple to remember.</p><p>If your PUK code was delivered to you by email:</p><p>You got an email with multiple codes, including PUK1, PIN2, and PUK2.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/10/how-to-unlock-puk-blocked-sim-card-1.jpg"                      alt="go to settings and customize to unblock sim"                ></p><p>If your PIN is locked, use PUK1 to unlock it.</p><p>Only a few phones employ PIN2 and PUK2 codes to restrict access to certain SIM card functionalities.</p><p>PIN2: The default code for your SIM card; If this code has been altered, use the PUK2 code to restore it.</p><p>PUK2: Your PIN2’s unlock code if it has been blocked.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a class="link"   href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4729642&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1" >Advanced Find and Replace for Google Sheets, Lifetime subscription <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-3-How-Can-I-Have-My-PUK-Code-To-Unlock-Sim-Card"><a href="#Part-3-How-Can-I-Have-My-PUK-Code-To-Unlock-Sim-Card" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How Can I Have My PUK Code To Unlock Sim Card?"></a>Part 3: How Can I Have My PUK Code To Unlock Sim Card?</h2><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1868499/19272" target="_top" id="1868499">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1868499" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1868499/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end -->### 1\.

Please log in to the appropriate website or app, then go to your profile to see whether anything about “PUK” is available there.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/10/how-to-unlock-puk-blocked-sim-card-5.jpg"                      alt="go to career website and check your sim card puk"                ></p><p>It shouldn’t be an issue if you were utilizing or signed in to the platform before your SIM was disabled.

Contact your carrier<p>It’s time to call customer support, which should be simpler for most individuals if none of the above options work for you. For example, your mobile service provider created your SIM card. Therefore, they have all the information you would require. Before they divulge anything to you, though, they should be able to verify your identity.</p><p>Use a different phone to call your customer service number and describe the issue. And following a series of inquiries, they should offer your PUK number as identification.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/10/how-to-unlock-puk-blocked-sim-card-6.jpg"                      alt="solve the sim card not accessed issue"                ></p><p>However, customer service won’t release the code if you can’t back yourself up. And at that point, there’s probably nothing further you can do. Therefore, make sure you have some information, such as your name, address, date of birth, etc., before you call them.</p><h2 id="Part-4-Easy-Tool-For-Sim-Card-Unlock"><a href="#Part-4-Easy-Tool-For-Sim-Card-Unlock" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: Easy Tool For Sim Card Unlock"></a>Part 4: Easy Tool For Sim Card Unlock</h2><p>If you want to unlock your PUK blocked sim card, you can use a network unlock tool like Dr.Fone.

To be sure and precise whether the phone is SIM locked, the best thing that can be done is to contact the carrier and check if the phone is carrier locked. Before that, you can even check the phone yourself by placing a different SIM in the phone and check whether it works. If the same issue persists even with different SIMs, then there is a good chance that the phone is carrier locked. Now that we know how to check if the phone is SIM locked, it is imperative to know how to unlock Android phone for different carrier. It is not that difficult a task to unlock carrier locked phones and there are a few methods to unlock such locked phones.</p><h2 id="Part-1-Asking-the-Carrier-to-Unlock"><a href="#Part-1-Asking-the-Carrier-to-Unlock" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Asking the Carrier to Unlock"></a>Part 1: Asking the Carrier to Unlock</h2><p>One of the best options is getting in touch with the carrier and asking them to unlock the SIM locked phone. For that to happen, it is important to first know whether the phone is SIM locked and then whether the phone can be unlocked and if you are eligible to unlock the phone. There is an eligibility clause in contract for Smartphones bought on contract and if a specific time period is not up yet, then a termination fee is required to be paid by the user to break the contract in order to be able to use any SIM on the Nubia Red Magic 9 Pro device after getting the unlock code.</p><p><strong><em>Pros</em></strong></p><p>• This is the best way to unlock carrier locked devices.</p><p>• This is legal and everything happens based on the clause mentioned in the contract.</p><p><strong>_Cons<br>_</strong></p><p>• Sometimes, even the network providers or carrier refuse to unlock Smartphone</p><p>• There is a certain time period which if not over yet, unlocking the phone would require termination fee.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe id="iframe_1374819" src="//a.impactradius-go.com/gen-ad-code/5597632/1374819/15852" width="250" height="250" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" marginheight="0" marginwidth="0"></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end -->## Part 2: Professional Reputable Smartphone Unlock Service<p>If you have tried out contacting the carrier and there is no way the carrier is unlocking your phone, you can opt for professional unlock service which could be of help. But finding such a professional service is not an easy task. There are some sites and service providers which require the IMEI number of the phone to create unlock codes. IMEI number of the phone is given to the professional SIM unlock service post which, they generate a special character combination which can be used to get the cell phone out of network restrictions. So, the phone can be unlocked remotely by using the special remote unlock codes.</p><p>Sometimes, the professional Smartphone service providers even ask for the phone to be sent to them to get the phone unlocked.</p><p><strong><em>Pros</em></strong></p><p>• This method could be opted as a last resort if there is no help from the carrier.</p><p>• Professional and reputable Smartphone unlock service providers tend to serve the purpose as they are specialized in this task.</p><p>• There are not many obligations involved.</p><p><strong>_Cons<br>_</strong></p><p>• This might attract legal actions against the user.</p><p>• It is very difficult to find such professional Smartphone unlock service providers.</p><p>• Reliability on such service providers is also another factor which requires attention.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2082536/7443" target="_top" id="2082536">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2082536" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="1456" height="180"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2082536/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end -->## Part 3: Unlock Android to Use Any SIM via Doctor SIM<p>Compared to connecting with your network provider, choosing an unlocking software may be a quicker and easier way. <a class="link"   href="https://www.doctorsim.com/gb-en/?scp" >Doctor SIM <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> could be a good option.

Freedom to choose your carrier</strong></li></ul><p>When your phone is carrier locked, you are limited to using only the carrier that the phone is locked to.

By unlocking your phone’s SIM card, you will be able to use any carrier’s SIM card, giving you the freedom to choose the carrier that best suits your needs.</p><ul><li><strong>2. Cost savings</strong></li></ul><p>By unlocking your phone’s SIM card, you can save money on roaming charges when traveling. Instead of paying expensive roaming charges, you can simply purchase a local SIM card and use it in your unlocked phone. This can save you a lot of money in the long run.</p><ul><li><strong>3. Resale value</strong></li></ul><p>An unlocked phone has a higher resale value than a carrier-locked phone. This is because an unlocked phone can be used with any carrier’s SIM card, making it more attractive to buyers.</p><ul><li><strong>4. No need to buy a new phone</strong></li></ul><p>If you want to switch to a different carrier, you may be tempted to buy a new phone that is compatible with that carrier.

Phones are our life source in this global age, it’s our tether to reality, to the world! But if you have a carrier locked phone, then that connection is basically under contract by an external agency! You can’t change your networks, there are limitations on how you use your phone, and when you have to travel abroad you have no option other than paying the roaming charges. If you, say, have an iPhone 5c and have these frustrations, it’s likely you’re already wondering how to unlock the iPhone 5c.</p><p>Chances are that if you’ve had a carrier locked phone for a while, you might have already forgotten what cellular freedom feels like. But we’re here to remind you. All you have to do is break that carrier-lock, and you’re good to go. However, you should be careful when doing so, cause if you try using a jailbreaking technique, it could have major repercussions. So we’re here to give you some valuable advice about how to unlock iPhone 5, iPhone 5c, or even Android phones.</p><h2 id="Part-1-Unlock-SIM-Card-on-ZTE-Nubia-Flip-5G-via-jailbreak"><a href="#Part-1-Unlock-SIM-Card-on-ZTE-Nubia-Flip-5G-via-jailbreak" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Unlock SIM Card on ZTE Nubia Flip 5G via jailbreak"></a>Part 1: Unlock SIM Card on ZTE Nubia Flip 5G via jailbreak</h2><p>Before we get into telling you how to unlock iPhone 5, or the SIM Card on iPhone or Android, we should first tell you what Jailbreaking is. You might have heard of this term before, and I’m sure it sounded ominous to you. Jailbreak? It sounds awfully close to ‘Prison break.’ Well, considering the carrier lock is sort of like a prison for your cell, it is an accurate terminology. But Jailbreak isn’t just about breaking the carrier lock. That might happen as a by-product, but the real purpose is to break free of the software restrictions which are generally applied to Apple devices. This might seem like a good option because, well, who doesn’t want to break free of all of Apple’s restrictions? But that always comes at several heavy risks.</p><h3 id="Threats-of-unlocking-SIM-via-Jailbreak"><a href="#Threats-of-unlocking-SIM-via-Jailbreak" class="headerlink" title="Threats of unlocking SIM via Jailbreak"></a>Threats of unlocking SIM via Jailbreak</h3><h4 id="1-Not-Permanent"><a href="#1-Not-Permanent" class="headerlink" title="1. Not Permanent"></a>1. Not Permanent</h4><p>This has got to be one of the biggest reasons for not jailbreaking your phone. It is not at all permanent! In fact, the moment you update your system, your jailbreak is lost and if you’ve started using a different SIM it will no longer function, and you’re gonna have to go back to using that Carrier you tried so hard to escape from! It’s really not worth the effort. Of course, you could stop updating altogether, but then that will bring us to…</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2016/10/14771444107532.jpg"                      alt="Unlock SIM Card on iPhone and Android via jailbreak"                ></p><h4 id="2-Risky"><a href="#2-Risky" class="headerlink" title="2. Risky"></a>2. Risky</h4><p>If you don’t update your iOS, or Mac or iPad or any device at all, in this day and age, you’re basically just asking to be hacked. That is not to excuse those who do the hacking and plant malware on your system, but if you leave your front door open in a shitty neighborhood, well then you only have yourself to blame once you get robbed!</p><h4 id="3-Warranty"><a href="#3-Warranty" class="headerlink" title="3. Warranty"></a>3. Warranty</h4><p>Jailbreaking has now become kind-of-legal, in a very tenuous sense, but that doesn’t mean Apple wholeheartedly welcomes jailbreaking. If you do so, you will never again be able to avail of the warranty on your phone. And with the kind of major bucks you have to shell out for those iPhones, you best keep that warranty intact.</p><h4 id="4-Lack-of-Apps"><a href="#4-Lack-of-Apps" class="headerlink" title="4. Lack of Apps"></a>4. Lack of Apps</h4><p>Many top-notch and crucial app companies and organizations simply refuse to make their applications usable in jailbreak phones, as they are extremely risky and prone to hacking. As a result, you would have to rely on a bunch of non-professional apps made by amateurs, which is more likely to put your phone in harm’s way.</p><h4 id="5-Bricking"><a href="#5-Bricking" class="headerlink" title="5. Bricking"></a>5. Bricking</h4><p>This basically means your whole system may crash and stop functioning. As a result, you’re gonna’ have to restore the whole thing and try to salvage whatever information you can. Now those who do jailbreak regularly will give you all kinds of excuses like it happens only rarely or that you can retrieve your data simply from the cloud, et al. But do you really want to divest all your time and energy trying to fight off malware, backing up all your data, etc, especially when there is a much more convenient option just around the corner?</p><p>Didn’t think so.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2087484/7443" target="_top" id="2087484"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2087484"                      border="0" alt="" width="1200" height="600"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2087484/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-unlock-SIM-Card-on-iPhone-without-jailbreak-Bonus"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-unlock-SIM-Card-on-iPhone-without-jailbreak-Bonus" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to unlock SIM Card on iPhone without jailbreak[Bonus]"></a>Part 2: How to unlock SIM Card on iPhone without jailbreak[Bonus]</h2><p>As mentioned above, unlocking by jailbreaking is risky and only temporary.

Your iPhone will be unlocked automatically Over-The-Air, simply connect it to a Wifi network (Available for iOS 7, iOS 8, iOS 9, iOS 10 or higher, iOS 6 or lower should be unlocked by iTunes). So you don’t need to send your iPhone to the network provider.

Your SIM locks itself after three to five wrong inputs, on average. Although it might be annoying, doing these guards against unauthorized access to your phone and personal data. If your cell phone is lost or stolen, PUK blocked will prevent prospective hackers from making calls.</p><p>Your mobile phone display can say “PIN blocked” or “Enter PUK code.” PUK stands for PIN Unblocking Key in the PUK code. The PUK code is seldom given to you when you receive your membership in the US. Contact Your Nubia Z50 Ultra provider’s customer support if you don’t know your PUK code.</p><h2 id="Part-1-Why-Was-My-Sim-Card-Blocked"><a href="#Part-1-Why-Was-My-Sim-Card-Blocked" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Why Was My Sim Card Blocked?"></a>Part 1: Why Was My Sim Card Blocked?</h2><h3 id="1-3-times-incorrect-Pin-entered"><a href="#1-3-times-incorrect-Pin-entered" class="headerlink" title="1. 3 times incorrect Pin entered"></a>1. 3 times incorrect Pin entered</h3><p>Sometimes when you forget your pin and keep on entering the wrong one, you can get PUK Blocked. You can utilize three to five chances, and your sim gets blocked when you enter the incorrect pin in all of these attempts.</p><h3 id="2-Wrong-PUK-code-entered"><a href="#2-Wrong-PUK-code-entered" class="headerlink" title="2.

This 4-digit code protects your phone number from unauthorized calls, texts, and data use. It’s essential to change the default PIN to one that’s both memorable for you and difficult for others to guess.</p><p>So, <strong>how to change the PIN on an Android phone</strong>’s SIM card? This article will provide a step-by-step guide to help you secure your data. But first, let’s explore why changing the default one is important.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/02/how-to-change-pin-on-android-phone-01.jpg"                      alt="a phone sim card"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4718730&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"> <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/ce9a6fb2becc2d235e62b125e9260102/products/copy_vMixCallScreenshot1-large.jpg"                      border="0"                >vMix HD - Software based live production. vMix HD includes everything in vMix Basic HD plus 1000 inputs, Video List, 4 Overlay Channels, and 1 vMix Call<br>This bundle includes Studio 200 for vMix from Virtualsetworks, HTTP Matrix 1.0 automation scheduler, and 4 introductory training videos from the Udemy vMix Basic to Amazing course. </a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2100530/7443" target="_top" id="2100530">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2100530" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="1456" height="180"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2100530/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end -->## Part 1: Why Does Changing Your SIM PIN Code Matter on a New Phone?<p>Your SIM PIN code acts as a password for your SIM card, which stores your phone number, contacts, and other essential data. Unlike the PIN you use to unlock your phone, the SIM PIN code is a separate layer of security. If someone tries to use your SIM card in another phone without the correct PIN, they won’t be able to access your network or data.</p><p>Here are more reasons why <strong>changing the PIN code of a SIM card</strong> is a smart move:</p><ul><li>Default PINs are easy to guess</li></ul><p>Most carriers use generic PINs like “1234” or “0000”. Change it to something unique and harder to crack.</p><ul><li>Protects data in case of loss or theft</li></ul><p>If you lose your phone or it gets stolen, a strong PIN code hinders the thief’s ability to make calls, send messages, or access your data stored on the SIM. It buys you time to report the loss and block your SIM card before they can do any damage.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/02/how-to-change-pin-on-android-phone-02.jpg"                      alt="sim card locked"                ></p><ul><li>Prevents accidental PIN lockouts</li></ul><p>Using a memorable PIN minimizes the risk of accidentally locking yourself out of your SIM card.</p><ul><li>Peace of mind</li></ul><p>It is crucial if you store sensitive info on your SIM or use your phone for work. Knowing about this extra safeguard is reassuring, ensuring your data stays protected.</p><p><strong>Remember:</strong></p><p>Choose a PIN code for your SIM that’s easy for you to remember but challenging for others to guess. Avoid using birthdays, anniversaries, or other easily identifiable information. By taking a few minutes to <strong>change the PIN code of the SIM card</strong>, you’ll gain a significant security advantage for your new phone and data.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-To-Change-Pin-on-Android-Phone-SIM-Cards"><a href="#Part-2-How-To-Change-Pin-on-Android-Phone-SIM-Cards" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How To Change Pin on Android Phone SIM Cards?"></a>Part 2: How To Change Pin on Android Phone SIM Cards?</h2><p>Keeping your SIM card secure is crucial for protecting your data and privacy. Thankfully, Android allows you to easily change your SIM card PIN to a more personal and memorable code. But before you begin:</p><ul><li>Contact your network carrier to get your PUK code if you already have it. You’ll need this if you enter the wrong PIN three times and lock your SIM card.</li><li>Remember the temporary default PIN: Most SIM cards have a default PIN, often 1234 or 0123. If you haven’t changed it, this is the PIN you’ll use initially.</li></ul><p><strong>Note:</strong></p><p>Entering the wrong PIN three times will lock your SIM card. You’ll need your network carrier’s PUK code to unlock it. Use it cautiously, as exceeding the maximum number of attempts will permanently block your SIM card. So, it’s best to memorize your PIN or store it securely to avoid relying on the PUK altogether.</p><p>Steps To Change Your SIM PIN</p><p>Here’s <strong>how to find and manage the SIM PIN code on Android</strong>:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Navigate to your phone’s <strong>Settings</strong> app. Next, look for the <strong>Security and privacy</strong> or <strong>Lock screen and security</strong> (or other similar option) depending on your device’s model.</li><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Scroll down and tap on <strong>More security settings</strong> or <strong>Other security settings</strong>.</li><li><strong>Step 3:</strong> Tap <strong>SIM card security</strong> or <strong>Set up SIM card lock</strong> (or something similar).</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/02/how-to-change-pin-on-android-phone-03.jpg"                      alt="sim card security in settings"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe id="iframe_2135471" src="//a.impactradius-go.com/gen-ad-code/5597632/2135471/18498" width="1080" height="1920" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" marginheight="0" marginwidth="0"></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end -->- **Step 4:** If you have multiple SIMs, select the one you want to change the PIN code.- **Step 5:** Tap **Change SIM PIN**.<p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/02/how-to-change-pin-on-android-phone-04.jpg"                      alt="change sim pin code on android"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Step 6:</strong> Input your current SIM card PIN code and tap <strong>OK</strong>.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/02/how-to-change-pin-on-android-phone-05.jpg"                      alt="enter old sim pin"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2068433/7443" target="_top" id="2068433">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2068433" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="1456" height="180"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2068433/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end -->- **Step 7:** Enter your desired new PIN code and tap **OK**.- **Step 8:** Re-enter your new SIM card PIN code and tap **OK** to confirm.<p>Success!

The International Mobile Equipment Identity (IMEI) is a unique 15-digit number assigned to every mobile device, such as smartphones and tablets. This number serves as an identifier, helping to distinguish your device from millions of others. One of the main reasons people want to change their Android IMEI number is to unblock a device that has been blacklisted by their network provider. Other reasons include accessing certain network features and services or maintaining anonymity.</p><p>Changing your Android IMEI without root access may seem like a daunting task, but this comprehensive guide will walk you through the process step-by-step. Before proceeding, please note that altering your device’s IMEI number can be illegal in some countries, and may void your warranty. Proceed with caution and at your own risk.

Users can block stolen or lost devices for further usage if they know their IMEI number. All users need to call their network carrier and report that the Tecno Spark 10 5G device is stolen or lost. The carrier can block the specific device from running on their network and notify other carriers.</li><li>The 15-digit IMEI number indicates the origin and model of the Tecno Spark 10 5G device. The first eight digits indicate the Tecno Spark 10 5G device’s origin and its model while the last six digits identify the Tecno Spark 10 5G device’s manufacturer.</li><li>If you subscribe to a mobile tracking service, you can use the IMEI number to track the Tecno Spark 10 5G device—even if it uses a different SIM card.</li></ol><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://imp.i357552.net/c/5597632/947750/11832" target="_top" id="947750">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/11832-947750" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.i357552.net/i/5597632/947750/11832"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end -->### Pros and Cons of Changing Android IMEI<p>Like many other things out there, changing Android IMEI has both advantages and disadvantages. Here are some of them:</p><p><strong>Advantages</strong></p><ol><li>Make your Android untraceable. By constantly changing your IMEI, you will throw off the tracks of people using it to stalk you!</li><li>Fix any invalid IMEI-related issues such as lost or invalid IMEI numbers. Once you change your IMEI, your Android device with the same benefits and features.</li><li>Obtaining a completely new device ID.</li><li>Changing the IMEI number to one that indicates it is a newer model, you will be able to enjoy new OS updates by resetting, repairing, and updating your Android device.</li><li>Have you ever yearned for that cheap BlackBerry plan your network carrier keeps on promoting? The 15-digit IMEI indicates the origin and model of your device. Therefore, by changing your Android’s IMEI number to that of a BlackBerry’s, you will be able to subscribe to a cheaper mobile plan.</li></ol><p><strong>Disadvantages</strong></p><ol><li>Before we begin, we need to make it clear that the process of changing IMEI without root can be illegal in some countries. We advise you to check the laws and regulations in your country before attempting to change your device’s IMEI number. As far as we know, it is legal in Africa and Asia, and illegal in Europe.</li><li>The IMEI number is hardcoded into your device. Therefore, changing your device’s IMEI number may void your device warranty and cause other issues such as network problems and software instability.</li><li>Legally, you have forfeited your ownership of your mobile device. When you purchase your device, the seller will jot down the original IMEI number on your receipt. So if you changed your IMEI and lost it, you may not be able to claim it. This is because authorities cannot see if it is truly yours. After all, the IMEI numbers no longer correlate with each other.</li></ol><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Find-the-IMEI-on-an-Android-5-Ways"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Find-the-IMEI-on-an-Android-5-Ways" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Find the IMEI on an Android?

Cost savings</strong></li></ul><p>By unlocking your phone’s SIM card, you can save money on roaming charges when traveling.

Resale value</strong></li></ul><p>An unlocked phone has a higher resale value than a carrier-locked phone. This is because an unlocked phone can be used with any carrier’s SIM card, making it more attractive to buyers.</p><ul><li><strong>4. No need to buy a new phone</strong></li></ul><p>If you want to switch to a different carrier, you may be tempted to buy a new phone that is compatible with that carrier.

Your SIM locks itself after three to five wrong inputs, on average. Although it might be annoying, doing these guards against unauthorized access to your phone and personal data. If your cell phone is lost or stolen, PUK blocked will prevent prospective hackers from making calls.</p><p>Your mobile phone display can say “PIN blocked” or “Enter PUK code.” PUK stands for PIN Unblocking Key in the PUK code. The PUK code is seldom given to you when you receive your membership in the US. Contact Your Honor Magic 5 provider’s customer support if you don’t know your PUK code.</p><h2 id="Part-1-Why-Was-My-Sim-Card-Blocked"><a href="#Part-1-Why-Was-My-Sim-Card-Blocked" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Why Was My Sim Card Blocked?"></a>Part 1: Why Was My Sim Card Blocked?</h2><h3 id="1-3-times-incorrect-Pin-entered"><a href="#1-3-times-incorrect-Pin-entered" class="headerlink" title="1. 3 times incorrect Pin entered"></a>1. 3 times incorrect Pin entered</h3><p>Sometimes when you forget your pin and keep on entering the wrong one, you can get PUK Blocked. You can utilize three to five chances, and your sim gets blocked when you enter the incorrect pin in all of these attempts.</p><h3 id="2-Wrong-PUK-code-entered"><a href="#2-Wrong-PUK-code-entered" class="headerlink" title="2.

The International Mobile Equipment Identity (IMEI) is a unique 15-digit number assigned to every mobile device, such as smartphones and tablets. This number serves as an identifier, helping to distinguish your device from millions of others. One of the main reasons people want to change their Android IMEI number is to unblock a device that has been blacklisted by their network provider. Other reasons include accessing certain network features and services or maintaining anonymity.</p><p>Changing your Android IMEI without root access may seem like a daunting task, but this comprehensive guide will walk you through the process step-by-step. Before proceeding, please note that altering your device’s IMEI number can be illegal in some countries, and may void your warranty. Proceed with caution and at your own risk. Get to know <strong>how to change IMEI number</strong> now!</p><h2 id="Part-1-What-is-IMEI-and-Why-People-Change-The-IMEI-Number"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-IMEI-and-Why-People-Change-The-IMEI-Number" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What is IMEI and Why People Change The IMEI Number"></a>Part 1: What is IMEI and Why People Change The IMEI Number</h2><p>The International Mobile Equipment Identity (IMEI) is a unique identifier for every mobile device. It allows network providers and manufacturers to track and block devices if they are reported as lost or stolen. Changing your device’s IMEI can help to unblock a blacklisted device, access certain network features and services, or maintain anonymity. However, be aware that altering your IMEI number is illegal in some countries and may void your warranty.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/05/imei-number.jpg"                      alt="imei number"                ></p><h3 id="There-are-several-uses-of-the-IMEI-number"><a href="#There-are-several-uses-of-the-IMEI-number" class="headerlink" title="There are several uses of the IMEI number"></a>There are several uses of the IMEI number</h3><ol><li>As the use of mobile devices increases, the statistics of stolen and lost devices have been increasing as well. Users can block stolen or lost devices for further usage if they know their IMEI number. All users need to call their network carrier and report that the Honor 90 Pro device is stolen or lost. The carrier can block the specific device from running on their network and notify other carriers.</li><li>The 15-digit IMEI number indicates the origin and model of the Honor 90 Pro device. The first eight digits indicate the Honor 90 Pro device’s origin and its model while the last six digits identify the Honor 90 Pro device’s manufacturer.</li><li>If you subscribe to a mobile tracking service, you can use the IMEI number to track the Honor 90 Pro device—even if it uses a different SIM card.</li></ol><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://laganoo.pxf.io/c/5597632/1484944/16446" target="_top" id="1484944">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16446-1484944" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://laganoo.pxf.io/i/5597632/1484944/16446"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end -->### Pros and Cons of Changing Android IMEI<p>Like many other things out there, changing Android IMEI has both advantages and disadvantages. Here are some of them:</p><p><strong>Advantages</strong></p><ol><li>Make your Android untraceable. By constantly changing your IMEI, you will throw off the tracks of people using it to stalk you!</li><li>Fix any invalid IMEI-related issues such as lost or invalid IMEI numbers. Once you change your IMEI, your Android device with the same benefits and features.</li><li>Obtaining a completely new device ID.</li><li>Changing the IMEI number to one that indicates it is a newer model, you will be able to enjoy new OS updates by resetting, repairing, and updating your Android device.</li><li>Have you ever yearned for that cheap BlackBerry plan your network carrier keeps on promoting? The 15-digit IMEI indicates the origin and model of your device. Therefore, by changing your Android’s IMEI number to that of a BlackBerry’s, you will be able to subscribe to a cheaper mobile plan.</li></ol><p><strong>Disadvantages</strong></p><ol><li>Before we begin, we need to make it clear that the process of changing IMEI without root can be illegal in some countries. We advise you to check the laws and regulations in your country before attempting to change your device’s IMEI number. As far as we know, it is legal in Africa and Asia, and illegal in Europe.</li><li>The IMEI number is hardcoded into your device. Therefore, changing your device’s IMEI number may void your device warranty and cause other issues such as network problems and software instability.</li><li>Legally, you have forfeited your ownership of your mobile device. When you purchase your device, the seller will jot down the original IMEI number on your receipt. So if you changed your IMEI and lost it, you may not be able to claim it. This is because authorities cannot see if it is truly yours. After all, the IMEI numbers no longer correlate with each other.</li></ol><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Find-the-IMEI-on-an-Android-5-Ways"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Find-the-IMEI-on-an-Android-5-Ways" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Find the IMEI on an Android?

It’s separate from the SIM card, which stores information related to the subscriber and the carrier network. The SIM card contains data specific to the subscriber. This includes contacts, text messages, and network-related information.

This process erases user-installed apps, personal data, and settings. But it doesn’t affect the Honor 90 Pro device’s hardware identification, including the IMEI.</p><p>The IMEI is embedded into the hardware of the Honor 90 Pro device. It is typically printed on the Honor 90 Pro device’s packaging or can be found by dialing *#06# on the phone’s keypad. It’s a crucial identifier for mobile networks, and authorities use it to uniquely identify and track devices across networks. It remains unchanged even after a factory reset.</p><h2 id="Part-5-Requirements-for-Changing-Android-IMEI-without-Root"><a href="#Part-5-Requirements-for-Changing-Android-IMEI-without-Root" class="headerlink" title="Part 5: Requirements for Changing Android IMEI without Root"></a>Part 5: Requirements for Changing Android IMEI without Root</h2><p>Before you begin the process of changing your Android IMEI without root, there are a few things you will need:</p><ul><li><strong>A compatible Android device:</strong> The methods detailed in this guide are specifically for MediaTek (MTK) devices.

Get Your Honor 90 GT Phone Network-Ready</h2><p>A network-locked device tethers you to one carrier, limiting your choices. You might miss out on better deals, struggle with roaming charges abroad, or feel inconvenienced by limited coverage. And you can’t avoid these things without the right <strong>SIM network unlock PIN</strong>.</p><p>That’s why we’ve created this comprehensive guide to help you unlock your phone’s potential. This article will explain what a <strong>SIM network unlock PIN</strong> is, the process involved, and answer any questions you might have. Keep scrolling to learn more.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/02/sim-network-unlock-pin-01.jpg"                      alt="enter sim network unlock pin"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-Why-Is-Your-Honor-90-GT-Asking-for-a-SIM-Network-Unlock-PIN"><a href="#Part-1-Why-Is-Your-Honor-90-GT-Asking-for-a-SIM-Network-Unlock-PIN" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Why Is Your Honor 90 GT Asking for a SIM Network Unlock PIN?"></a>Part 1: Why Is Your Honor 90 GT Asking for a SIM Network Unlock PIN?</h2><p>You just bought a new phone, excited to use it with a new SIM card. But your phone pops up with a request for a PIN code to unlock it. What’s that all about, and what do you enter? There are two main reasons why your phone might be asking for a SIM PIN or unlock code:</p><p>SIM Network Lock</p><p>The SIM Network Lock is a restriction placed by your phone’s original network provider, locking it to their network.

Unlock It Now"></a>Network Locked SIM Card Inserted On Your Infinix Smart 7 HD Phone? Unlock It Now</h2><p>Carriers provide cellular connections so you can access the Internet, send text messages, and make phone calls without Wi-Fi. You cannot escape the carriers once you begin using a cell phone.</p><p>Customers can purchase a new handset via carriers or the mobile phone market. You may need an unlocked phone if you wish to use a different carrier’s service on your smartphone. However, if you want a gadget linked to a specific SIM card, you may buy one from the carriers for a reduced price.</p><h2 id="Part-1-What-Does-It-Mean-If-Your-Infinix-Smart-7-HD-Asks-for-SIM-Network-PIN"><a href="#Part-1-What-Does-It-Mean-If-Your-Infinix-Smart-7-HD-Asks-for-SIM-Network-PIN" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What Does It Mean If Your Infinix Smart 7 HD Asks for SIM Network PIN?"></a>Part 1: What Does It Mean If Your Infinix Smart 7 HD Asks for SIM Network PIN?</h2><p>When your phone prompts you to enter a SIM Network Unlock PIN, it means that your device is currently locked to a specific mobile network carrier, and it can only be used with SIM cards from that carrier. This locking mechanism is usually put in place by the carrier or the phone manufacturer to ensure that you continue to use their services, typically for the duration of a contract. As a result, your phone cannot be freely used with SIM cards from other carriers until it’s unlocked using the correct PIN or code.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/11/fix-network-locked-simcard-inserted-01.jpg"                      alt="sim locked"                ></p><h2 id="Part-2-Why-Does-Your-Infinix-Smart-7-HD-Say-Invalid-SIM-Card-–-Network-Locked-SIM-Card-Inserted"><a href="#Part-2-Why-Does-Your-Infinix-Smart-7-HD-Say-Invalid-SIM-Card-–-Network-Locked-SIM-Card-Inserted" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Why Does Your Infinix Smart 7 HD Say Invalid SIM Card – Network Locked SIM Card Inserted?"></a>Part 2: Why Does Your Infinix Smart 7 HD Say Invalid SIM Card – Network Locked SIM Card Inserted?</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/11/fix-network-locked-simcard-inserted-2.jpg"                      alt="remove network lock"                ></p><p><strong>System Errors</strong></p><p>Since SIM locking is a smartphone restriction implemented to stop it from being used on other networks, Android system errors can cause network-locked SIM cards. Resetting these errors can help unlock your <strong>network locked SIM card inserted</strong> device. Service providers decided to provide a formal SIM unlocking option as a result.</p><p>Because of this, any locked SIM may be readily unlocked, and once a device opens, it can work like a conventional mobile phone and with any SIM card of the user’s choosing.</p><p><strong>Carrier Lock</strong></p><p>The consumer must stick with the same service provider for a specific time after purchasing the bundled device and data pack. This is called a carrier lock on the Infinix Smart 7 HD device and is one of the most common errors in <strong>network locked SIM card inserted</strong> devices. During that time, the Infinix Smart 7 HD device will be network- or SIM-locked, prohibiting the user from changing service providers.</p><p>The user cannot change the SIM. The service provider will offer the SIM Unlock code needed to unlock the handset when the contract expires. The gadget can be used with any other SIM card and exported to another country without problems when the network lock has been removed.</p><p><strong>Region Lock</strong></p><p>Apple and AT&amp;T initially worked together to implement the SIM lock and the SIM locked devices. The original purpose was to force the user to continue using the same service provider in a specific area or time.</p><p>However, some telecom service providers sell the handsets with select data plans as bundled plans in collaboration with the Infinix Smart 7 HD device manufacturers. As a result, the handset will cost less than it would otherwise. Sometimes, these offers are particular to a specific region, called a carrier lock.</p><p><strong>Firmware Problems</strong></p><p>Sometimes, the Infinix Smart 7 HD device manufacturers release many versions of the same firmware for different geographical locations.</p><p>As a result, it may be possible that the user may face contradictions in the agreement of device firmware and the network-locked SIM card that was supposed to be used on the Infinix Smart 7 HD device. Due to firmware problems, the users may also face a network-locked SIM card-inserted device.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/11/fix-network-locked-simcard-inserted-03.png"                      alt="unlock sim card"                ></p><h2 id="Part-3-How-to-Unlock-Network-Locked-SIM-Card-Inserted"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-Unlock-Network-Locked-SIM-Card-Inserted" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How to Unlock Network Locked SIM Card Inserted?"></a>Part 3: How to Unlock Network Locked SIM Card Inserted?</h2><p>Unlocking a network-locked SIM card may seem like a complex task. However, it can be a straightforward process if you follow the right steps. In this section, we will guide you through the process of unlocking your network-locked SIM card. We will discuss 3 different ways you can unlock a <strong>network-locked SIM card inserted</strong>:</p><h3 id="Method-1-Contact-Network-Carrier-to-Unlock-Network-Locked-SIM"><a href="#Method-1-Contact-Network-Carrier-to-Unlock-Network-Locked-SIM" class="headerlink" title="Method 1. Contact Network Carrier to Unlock Network Locked SIM"></a>Method 1. Contact Network Carrier to Unlock Network Locked SIM</h3><p>Contacting your network carrier is often the most recommended choice. It is a straightforward and reliable method to unlock your network-locked SIM card. Unlocking your network-locked SIM card through your carrier is a reliable and legal method. Before contacting your carrier, get information like your device’s IMEI number and account details. There are several ways to get in touch with your network carrier’s customer support.</p><p>You can call the customer support hotline, visit the website, or go to a physical store. The process usually involves receiving an unlock network code, which you need to use. Once you’ve entered the unlock code, your phone should display that it’s now unlocked. Test it with the new SIM card to ensure that it can make calls, send texts, and access mobile data without any issues.</p><h3 id="Method-2-Use-Online-Unlock-Service-to-Unlock-Network-Locked-SIM"><a href="#Method-2-Use-Online-Unlock-Service-to-Unlock-Network-Locked-SIM" class="headerlink" title="Method 2. Use Online Unlock Service to Unlock Network Locked SIM"></a>Method 2. Use Online Unlock Service to Unlock Network Locked SIM</h3><p>There are many online services available for unlocking a <strong>network-locked SIM card</strong>. In case you don’t want to go through your network carrier, these can be a good alternative. These services employ the IMEI number of the Infinix Smart 7 HD device to unlock smartphones.</p><p>One such service is <a class="link"   href="https://canadaunlocking.com/" >Canada Unlocking <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, which offers to unlock your network-locked SIM card via email.
