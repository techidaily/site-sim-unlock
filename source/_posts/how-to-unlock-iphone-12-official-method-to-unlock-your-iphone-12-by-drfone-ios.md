## Part 1: What Should You Do Before Apple iPhone 12 SIM Unlock?

Before unlocking your Apple iPhone 12 from the carrier, you should fulfill the following criteria.

### 1\. No Due Before Unlocking

When iPhone users sign contracts with a giant cell phone company for a certain amount of time, they often get a discount on a device. Because of this, the Apple iPhone 12 device comes with a controller lock so customers can only use it on their network.

So, if you've paid off your contract or bought your Apple iPhone 12 without a subsidy, it's perfectly legal to unlock it. But if you're still paying off your contract, you still need to own the Apple iPhone 12 fully, so you should confirm with your carrier before unlocking it.

### 2\. You Should Buy It for More Than the Time Limit in the Contract

You can leave without paying anything if your agreement with the company is over. If you signed a contract in exchange for a lower price upfront, you would have to wait until your contract ended (usually 24 months) or pay the remaining balance if you bought your phone on a payment plan.

If you own an iPhone that is MetroPCS-branded, the carrier will probably lock it, making it impossible to use a SIM from another carrier on the Apple iPhone 12 device. Therefore, you will have to unlock iPhone MetroPCS for this purpose.

Many people find it difficult to unlock their MetroPCS iPhone and resort to buying a new phone altogether to use it with another service provider. In this article, you will learn how to use the MetroPCS unlock phones feature with three different methods. So, let’s get started!

### 1\. Calling MetroPCS to Unlock Phones

The first and most straightforward method to carrier unlocks MetroPCS phone is to call the company. But before you do that, make sure whether your phone has GSM/LTE or CDMA technology. Check for the small slot on the side of your phone to see whether there’s a SIM.

**Step 4**

The instructions involve turning off your phone, inserting the SIM card of the new carrier, and entering the provided code when prompted. And that’s how you unlock your MetroPCS phone for free via the official method.

### Method 1: Contact your carrier for unlock code

When a customer signs a contract with a big cell phone company for a certain amount of time, they often get a discount on a device. Because of this, the Apple iPhone 12 device comes with a controller lock so customers can only use it on their network.

You can leave without paying anything if your agreement with the company is over. You must meet the following requirements before you can unlock your Apple iPhone 12:

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![sim unlock pin](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/12/how-to-unlock-iphone-11-12-4.jpg)

- First, the Apple iPhone 12 device must be legal. It means the Apple iPhone 12 device has not been reported as lost, stolen, or connected to a crime.
- Then you shouldn't have any debts in your bank account.
- If you signed a contract in exchange for a lower price upfront, you would have to wait until your contract ended (usually 24 months) or pay the remaining balance if you bought your phone on a payment plan.

Note: the unlocking process is different for each company.

**How to unlock the Apple iPhone 12 locked by AT&T**

First, you need to know that AT&T limits how many devices a customer can unlock in a given year. Customers can unlock up to five devices per year if their account is in great condition. Visit the AT&T support page for more information about how to unlock an AT&T device and if you meet the requirements.

**AT&T Unlocking security question**

- The full name of the person whose name is on the account
- Last four digits of the account holder's social security number
- AT&T passcode of the registered account owner if they have an online account.
- The IMEI number of the Apple iPhone 12 is 11/12. The serial number of the Apple iPhone 12 device is called the IMEI number. You can find it on the original packaging, under the battery, and on the back of some models, by dialing #06 or navigating to Settings > General > About.

**How to unlock the Apple iPhone 12 locked by T-Mobile**

T-Mobile has set several standards that should be matched to complete an unlock request.

- The device must be completely paid off, and the account must be in great condition.
- In the past 12 months, less than two SIM unlock codes for each line have been asked for.
- The device had used the T-Mobile network for at least 40 days before it was asked to be unlocked.
- If you have a service contract and have made a payment for at least 18 consecutive months, or if you paid a relocation fee. There are a few special cases that Customer Service can explain in more detail if required.
- The phone must have at least $50 worth of recharges paid for on prepaid plans.
- If you meet the above prerequisites, you can unlock an Apple iPhone 12 carrier locked by a T-Mobile device by calling customer service at 611 from the Apple iPhone 12 device you want to unlock.
- Make sure you have ALL of the following information on tips when you call:

1. The main account holder's phone number
2. Account Password
3. Account holder's SSN's last four digits
4. IMEI number. You can find this by navigating Settings > General > About or dialing \*#06#.

iPhone unlock chips allow iPhones to run on any network globally. Unlocking an iPhone with this option is a cheap and very easy way. The Apple iPhone 12 unlock chip allows a locked Apple iPhone 12 to call and text using the local network sim card like a factory-unlocked phone. Unlock chip is a small SIM card that can be used along with regular SIM cards.
