If the phone is unlocked, the “unlocked word would certainly appear on the receipt. To be sure and precise whether the phone is SIM locked, the best thing that can be done is to contact the carrier and check if the phone is carrier locked. Before that, you can even check the phone yourself by placing a different SIM in the phone and check whether it works.

There is an eligibility clause in contract for Smartphones bought on contract and if a specific time period is not up yet, then a termination fee is required to be paid by the user to break the contract in order to be able to use any SIM on the Itel P55 device after getting the unlock code.

But finding such a professional service is not an easy task. There are some sites and service providers which require the IMEI number of the phone to create unlock codes. IMEI number of the phone is given to the professional SIM unlock service post which, they generate a special character combination which can be used to get the cell phone out of network restrictions. So, the phone can be unlocked remotely by using the special remote unlock codes.

Sometimes, the professional Smartphone service providers even ask for the phone to be sent to them to get the phone unlocked.

**_Pros_**

• This method could be opted as a last resort if there is no help from the carrier.

• Professional and reputable Smartphone unlock service providers tend to serve the purpose as they are specialized in this task.

• There are not many obligations involved.

### Q3: What is the Master Unlock Code for a Samsung?

A Master PIN code, also known as a [Samsung Unlock Code](https://drfone.wondershare.com/unlock/samsung-unlock-codes.html), is a unique numeric code that can be used to unlock a Samsung device. This code is typically provided by the manufacturer or carrier and is used to remove any restrictions or limitations on the Itel P55 device. It allows the user to use the Itel P55 device with any carrier or SIM card, giving them more flexibility and freedom. It is important to note that the Master PIN code is different from the Itel P55 device's regular PIN or password, and it should be kept confidential to prevent unauthorized access to the Itel P55 device.
