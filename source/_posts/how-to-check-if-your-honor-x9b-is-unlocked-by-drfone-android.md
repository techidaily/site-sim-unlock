Before delving into specific methods, let’s address the most direct way to confirm your phone’s unlock status: the SIM card swap. This is one of the main ways **how to tell if a phone is unlocked**. Insert a SIM card from a carrier different from your current provider.

If the phone accepts the new SIM and allows calls and data usage, congratulations, your phone is unlocked! Conversely, if the phone displays an error message like “SIM Not Supported” or “Invalid SIM,” it’s likely locked to your current carrier.

Remember, each carrier has its policies and procedures regarding unlocking. Consult your carrier’s official website or contact customer support for specific instructions and eligibility requirements.

Step 1. Visit Doctor - SIM Unlock Service official website, click on the Select Your Honor X9b button, and then select Honor among all the phone brands.

## Part 3: Honor X9b Unlock Carrier

If your Honor X9b is hard locked, this is your best bet in getting your device unlocked. Actually, it is the safest method among all three:

1. Get a new SIM card from a new carrier.
2. Call your carrier's customer service line and ask what are the requirements to qualify you to get your Honor X9b unlocked. If you have honored your contract, there should not be any problems. However, do ask your carrier if there are any additional requirements. Do note that there may be fees involved.
3. Once your customer service representative has determined if you have met all their requirements, they should give you the SIM network unlock PIN Honor X9b. Again, depending on your carrier, they might either give you the code over the phone, through email or via SMS. If you have the choice, always opt for email or SMS so that you are able to jot down the right number.
4. Once you have gotten the code, insert the new SIM card (from your new carrier). You will receive a prompt to enter your code. Make sure that you key in the right code---entering the wrong code will cause your phone to be locked (possibly forever).

## Part 5: The benefits of an unlocked Honor X9b

If you now know how to unlock Honor X9b but still do not know its advantages, we are here to help.

As indicated in the introduction, unlocked phone users can freely choose the plans they subscribed to---on any carriers, in any country. Therefore, if you travel frequently around the world, having an unlocked Honor X9b would be beneficial. Using a local SIM card is much cheaper than paying for exorbitant roaming charges.

You can also benefit from an unlocked Honor X9b if you are the kind of person who likes to take advantage of current offers provided by your local carriers. Prepaid plans are always changing in terms of offering so having the flexibility of changing carriers and prepaid plans can help you save money in the long run.

## Part 6: The downside of an unlocked Honor X9b

Are you thinking "Well, why can't I just buy an unlocked Honor X9b in the first place?" right about now? Well, you can but think of the amount of money it will cost you.

For example, in Australia, an unlocked Honor X9b will cost around $499 from any Honor outlet but $0 for the Honor X9b device when you pair it with a 24-month postpaid plan. While this may look attractive now, you may be paying more for a locked Honor X9b in the long run.

## Conclusion

Now that you know the three ways of unlocking your Honor X9b, all you need to do is find one that is most compatible with you. Just remember to think of everything through and carefully. Most importantly, if you have a locked device, always seek advice from your carrier to see if this is possible.
