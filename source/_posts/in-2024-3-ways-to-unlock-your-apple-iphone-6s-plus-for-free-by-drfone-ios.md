## Part 1: What Should You Do Before Apple iPhone 6s Plus SIM Unlock?

Before unlocking your Apple iPhone 6s Plus from the carrier, you should fulfill the following criteria.

### 1\. No Due Before Unlocking

When iPhone users sign contracts with a giant cell phone company for a certain amount of time, they often get a discount on a device. Because of this, the Apple iPhone 6s Plus device comes with a controller lock so customers can only use it on their network.

So, if you've paid off your contract or bought your Apple iPhone 6s Plus without a subsidy, it's perfectly legal to unlock it. But if you're still paying off your contract, you still need to own the Apple iPhone 6s Plus fully, so you should confirm with your carrier before unlocking it.

### 2\. You Should Buy It for More Than the Time Limit in the Contract

You can leave without paying anything if your agreement with the company is over. If you signed a contract in exchange for a lower price upfront, you would have to wait until your contract ended (usually 24 months) or pay the remaining balance if you bought your phone on a payment plan.

### Examples: Requirements of Sim Unlock of T-Mobile/EE/AT&T

T-Mobile, EE, and AT&T have common requirements before you can unlock your Apple iPhone 6s Plus.

- It has to be legal. It means the Apple iPhone 6s Plus device has not been reported as lost, stolen, or linked to a crime.
- Your bank account shouldn't have any debts.
- If you signed a contract in exchange for a lower price upfront, you would have to wait until your contract was up (usually 24 months) or pay the remaining balance if you bought your phone on a payment plan.

Apart from the requirements mentioned above, each company has its way of unlocking.

**T-Mobile**

## How to Check iPhone SIM Lock Status?

Before you try any other solution, you should check the nature of the Lock on your Apple iPhone 6s Plus. Once you know the problem, you can move on to the right solution.

### 1\. Contact your service provider

Well, this is not a quick solution. You must contact your service provider to determine the sim lock status. Generally, you have to submit a request to the company and the IMEI number. The company will later inform you about the Sim lock status of your Apple iPhone 6s Plus through E-mail or any other channel.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### 2\. Check it via "Carrier Lock" in "Settings."

Navigate to Settings > General > About.

![carrier lock](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/12/unlock-iphone-online-7.jpg)

Apple has added a new Network Provider Lock section to iOS 14 that immediately tells you the Apple iPhone 6s Plus device's status.

Scroll down to find the section called "Network Provider Lock." If the Apple iPhone 6s Plus is unlocked, it should say "No SIM restrictions" on the screen. If you see something different, it means the Apple iPhone 6s Plus is locked.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### 3\. Check it via your IMEI code

If you know the IMEI number of your Apple iPhone 6s Plus, you can get one of those online IMEI-checking tools to see if the phone it belongs to is locked. Most of these services ask for money, which is a problem but generally, they ask for a very minimal amount.

### Conclusion

So, these were the ways to unlock your Apple iPhone 6s Plus online. Knowing about online unlocking services, you must have realized that you should trust them sparingly. Instead, you should go for a real solution. Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock is the best way to unlock iPhones locked to a carrier (iOS). If you don't want to contact your carrier, Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock can open any SIM-lock. This software works with iOS 12.0 to iOS 14.8.1 on iPhone 5S to iPhone X.
