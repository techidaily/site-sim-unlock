![dr.fone sim lock removal success](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/remove-iphone-sim-7.png)

**Disclaimer:** It’s vital to note that unlocking methods, particularly with third-party tools, may not always be successful, especially for newer iPhone models and iOS versions. Also, using third-party unlocking tools can void your phone’s warranty, leaving you responsible for any future repairs not covered by the manufacturer.

## Method 3: Using Online Unlockers To Unlock Telstra iPhones

While venturing into the online realm, you might encounter websites offering remote unlocking services for a fee. These services claim to **unlock your Telstra phone** quickly and conveniently, often without contacting the carrier. However, approaching this method requires extreme caution due to potential risks and legal implications.

Before diving in:

- **Understand the risks.**Online unlocking services operate in a gray area, potentially violating your carrier’s terms and conditions. This could lead to legal trouble or void your phone’s warranty.
- **Beware of scams.**Unfortunately, not all online unlocking services are legitimate. Many are scams designed to steal your money or personal information.
- **Do your research.**If you choose to proceed, thoroughly research the service provider. Read reviews from other users, check their track record, and ensure they have a good reputation.

These services typically require you to provide your phone’s IMEI number and pay a fee. They then claim to use various methods, often software or network vulnerabilities, to unlock your phone remotely. However, the success rate and security of these methods are highly questionable. Thus, relying on Dr.Fone as an alternative unlocking method is recommended.

### 3\. Unlock your Phone Fast & Secure

Download Link: [https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.unlockscope.app&hl=en](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.unlockscope.app&hl=en)

The major selling point of this app is that it supports a wide range of Android device. Using it however is not as easy as the ones we've seen above. You have to provide a lot of information about the Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max device before you can be provided with the unlocking code. Also, the app charges the user per unlocking code provided. The code is sent to the user's email address which also further complicates the process.
