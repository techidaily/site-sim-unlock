### Method 2: Unlocking With Your Carrier’s Official Methods

As mentioned earlier, carriers often provide official routes to unlock their devices. While typically requiring compliance with specific criteria, this method ensures you stay within your carrier’s policies.

Most carriers offer two common methods for unlocking their phones:

- **Paying an upfront fee.**If your contract period is still ongoing, certain carriers allow unlocking upon payment of a predetermined fee. Check your carrier’s website or contact customer support for eligibility and fee details.
- **Requesting a SIM unlock.**Once your contract has expired and you meet the carrier’s eligibility criteria (e.g., device payment completion), you can submit an official unlock request. Carriers typically have dedicated online portals or customer service channels for this process.

Remember, each carrier has its policies and procedures regarding unlocking. Consult your carrier’s official website or contact customer support for specific instructions and eligibility requirements.
