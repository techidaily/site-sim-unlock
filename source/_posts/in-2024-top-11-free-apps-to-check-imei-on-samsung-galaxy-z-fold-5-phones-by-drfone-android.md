Therefore, if you travel frequently around the world, having an unlocked Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 5 would be beneficial. Using a local SIM card is much cheaper than paying for exorbitant roaming charges.

You can also benefit from an unlocked Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 5 if you are the kind of person who likes to take advantage of current offers provided by your local carriers. Prepaid plans are always changing in terms of offering so having the flexibility of changing carriers and prepaid plans can help you save money in the long run.

## Part 6: The downside of an unlocked Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 5

Are you thinking "Well, why can't I just buy an unlocked Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 5 in the first place?" right about now? Well, you can but think of the amount of money it will cost you.

For example, in Australia, an unlocked Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 5 will cost around $499 from any Samsung outlet but $0 for the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 5 device when you pair it with a 24-month postpaid plan. While this may look attractive now, you may be paying more for a locked Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 5 in the long run.

## Conclusion

Now that you know the three ways of unlocking your Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 5, all you need to do is find one that is most compatible with you. Just remember to think of everything through and carefully. Most importantly, if you have a locked device, always seek advice from your carrier to see if this is possible.
