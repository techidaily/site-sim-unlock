## Three Ways to Sim Unlock Realme 11 Pro

You probably purchased your Realme 11 Pro for a significant discount but are now stuck with the same network for a couple of years. You loved the Realme 11 Pro device but your network provider does not have any plans that exactly suit your needs. To release your device from your current network's clutches, you will need to unlock your phone.

There are three ways you can do it and this post will go through each method so that you can find one that you are most comfortable with. Do note that if your contract has ended with your network provider, this "How to unlock Realme 11 Pro" post can be skipped as you can just ask them to unlock your phone or purchase a [sim network unlock pin](https://drfone.wondershare.com/unlock/unlock-samsung-sim-network-unlock-pin.html) for a minimal price.

## Part 1: Realme 11 Pro Unlock Code

This is probably the easiest, no-fuss method to [sim unlock](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/unlock-android-screen/) Realme 11 Pro. Follow these steps carefully to successfully perform Realme 11 Pro unlock code.

Do take note that this process may not work with your carrier. Therefore, always check if this is the right way to obtain the necessary code:

## Part 3: Realme 11 Pro Unlock Carrier

If your Realme 11 Pro is hard locked, this is your best bet in getting your device unlocked. Actually, it is the safest method among all three:

1. Get a new SIM card from a new carrier.
2. Call your carrier's customer service line and ask what are the requirements to qualify you to get your Realme 11 Pro unlocked. If you have honored your contract, there should not be any problems. However, do ask your carrier if there are any additional requirements. Do note that there may be fees involved.
3. Once your customer service representative has determined if you have met all their requirements, they should give you the SIM network unlock PIN Realme 11 Pro. Again, depending on your carrier, they might either give you the code over the phone, through email or via SMS. If you have the choice, always opt for email or SMS so that you are able to jot down the right number.
4. Once you have gotten the code, insert the new SIM card (from your new carrier). You will receive a prompt to enter your code. Make sure that you key in the right code---entering the wrong code will cause your phone to be locked (possibly forever).

## Part 5: The benefits of an unlocked Realme 11 Pro

If you now know how to unlock Realme 11 Pro but still do not know its advantages, we are here to help.

As indicated in the introduction, unlocked phone users can freely choose the plans they subscribed to---on any carriers, in any country. Therefore, if you travel frequently around the world, having an unlocked Realme 11 Pro would be beneficial. Using a local SIM card is much cheaper than paying for exorbitant roaming charges.

You can also benefit from an unlocked Realme 11 Pro if you are the kind of person who likes to take advantage of current offers provided by your local carriers. Prepaid plans are always changing in terms of offering so having the flexibility of changing carriers and prepaid plans can help you save money in the long run.

## Part 6: The downside of an unlocked Realme 11 Pro

Are you thinking "Well, why can't I just buy an unlocked Realme 11 Pro in the first place?" right about now? Well, you can but think of the amount of money it will cost you.

For example, in Australia, an unlocked Realme 11 Pro will cost around $499 from any Realme outlet but $0 for the Realme 11 Pro device when you pair it with a 24-month postpaid plan. While this may look attractive now, you may be paying more for a locked Realme 11 Pro in the long run.

## Conclusion

Now that you know the three ways of unlocking your Realme 11 Pro, all you need to do is find one that is most compatible with you. Just remember to think of everything through and carefully. Most importantly, if you have a locked device, always seek advice from your carrier to see if this is possible.
