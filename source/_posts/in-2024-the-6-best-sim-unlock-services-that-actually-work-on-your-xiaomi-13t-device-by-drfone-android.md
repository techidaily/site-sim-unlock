This service will unlock almost all devices, both Android and iPhone. It is also very fast and reliable. But perhaps the best feature of this service is that you can be aware of just how much you will have to spend to unlock your device long before you place the order.

To use the service, simply go to the main home page and check on the table provided how long it will take for your device to be unlocked and how much you have to pay. If you are happy with both estimates. Choose to unlock from the main menu and then proceed to select your device.

Once you have selected the Xiaomi 13T device, enter the IMEI code, your email address, your country, and the network you are on. Then click on "Proceed to check out". Make payment and then wait for the assigned time for the [sim network unlock pin](https://drfone.wondershare.com/unlock/unlock-samsung-sim-network-unlock-pin.html) to be sent to the email address you provided.

## Ways To Find Unlocking Codes For Xiaomi 13T Phones

When you have a locked device, it is pretty much impossible to move from one network to another. This would cause problems if for instance you wanted to travel outside the country and want to switch to that country's carrier for the duration of your stay. Or maybe you just want to switch carriers because you don't like your current provider.

Whatever the reason, you should be able to unlock your device easily. But this has often proven difficult because of the fact that you need unlock codes. The problem is that many sites promise free unlocking codes for your device and many turn out to be fraudulent sites that use the word "free" in their advertising but actually require you to pay for the service. If you have been unsuccessfully searching for free unlocking codes for your device, look no further. This article compiles three of the best for Android and iPhone.

Use the first one. If it fails to work, try the last code. 80% of people unlock their devices with either the first or the last code. Of this doesn't work either, try 2 more. But don't enter more than 4 codes as this will disable your device.

## Part 3: Popular Youtube Video for Unlocking Your Xiaomi 13T

Here we've found a popular video on Youtube for you to follow and sim unlock your phone.

<iframe width="800" height="450" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/393YR8Hum5g" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0"></iframe>

It is very important to note that by unlocking your device you are breaching the contract you have with your service provider. Also, note that if the codes fail to work the first 4 times don't try to enter a fifth time as this will generally disable your device. This will mean that you will be unable to use the Xiaomi 13T device. Proceed with caution.

## How to Unlock SIM Card on Xiaomi 13T online without jailbreak

Isn't it so frustrating when you try to change your SIM or your network, but just can't because your phone is locked under contract? Phones are our life source in this global age, it's our tether to reality, to the world! But if you have a carrier locked phone, then that connection is basically under contract by an external agency! You can't change your networks, there are limitations on how you use your phone, and when you have to travel abroad you have no option other than paying the roaming charges. If you, say, have an iPhone 5c and have these frustrations, it's likely you're already wondering how to unlock the iPhone 5c.

Chances are that if you've had a carrier locked phone for a while, you might have already forgotten what cellular freedom feels like. But we're here to remind you. All you have to do is break that carrier-lock, and you're good to go. However, you should be careful when doing so, cause if you try using a jailbreaking technique, it could have major repercussions. So we're here to give you some valuable advice about how to unlock iPhone 5, iPhone 5c, or even Android phones.

## Part 1: Unlock SIM Card on Xiaomi 13T via jailbreak

Before we get into telling you how to unlock iPhone 5, or the SIM Card on iPhone or Android, we should first tell you what Jailbreaking is. You might have heard of this term before, and I'm sure it sounded ominous to you. Jailbreak? It sounds awfully close to 'Prison break.' Well, considering the carrier lock is sort of like a prison for your cell, it is an accurate terminology. But Jailbreak isn't just about breaking the carrier lock. That might happen as a by-product, but the real purpose is to break free of the software restrictions which are generally applied to Apple devices. This might seem like a good option because, well, who doesn't want to break free of all of Apple's restrictions? But that always comes at several heavy risks.

### Threats of unlocking SIM via Jailbreak

#### 1\. Not Permanent

This has got to be one of the biggest reasons for not jailbreaking your phone. It is not at all permanent! In fact, the moment you update your system, your jailbreak is lost and if you've started using a different SIM it will no longer function, and you're gonna have to go back to using that Carrier you tried so hard to escape from! It's really not worth the effort. Of course, you could stop updating altogether, but then that will bring us to…

![Unlock SIM Card on iPhone and Android via jailbreak](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2016/10/14771444107532.jpg)

#### 2\. Risky

If you don't update your iOS, or Mac or iPad or any device at all, in this day and age, you're basically just asking to be hacked. That is not to excuse those who do the hacking and plant malware on your system, but if you leave your front door open in a shitty neighborhood, well then you only have yourself to blame once you get robbed!

#### 3\. Warranty

Jailbreaking has now become kind-of-legal, in a very tenuous sense, but that doesn't mean Apple wholeheartedly welcomes jailbreaking. If you do so, you will never again be able to avail of the warranty on your phone. And with the kind of major bucks you have to shell out for those iPhones, you best keep that warranty intact.

#### 4\. Lack of Apps

Many top-notch and crucial app companies and organizations simply refuse to make their applications usable in jailbreak phones, as they are extremely risky and prone to hacking. As a result, you would have to rely on a bunch of non-professional apps made by amateurs, which is more likely to put your phone in harm's way.

#### 5\. Bricking

This basically means your whole system may crash and stop functioning. As a result, you're gonna' have to restore the whole thing and try to salvage whatever information you can. Now those who do jailbreak regularly will give you all kinds of excuses like it happens only rarely or that you can retrieve your data simply from the cloud, et al. But do you really want to divest all your time and energy trying to fight off malware, backing up all your data, etc, especially when there is a much more convenient option just around the corner?

Didn't think so.

## Part 3: How to unlock SIM Card on iPhone and Android without jailbreak

Now that you know what not to do, i.e., jailbreak, we can finally tell you how to unlock iPhone 5 in a legal, safe and secure manner online, without jailbreaking. Up until a while back, one of the reasons people chose to jailbreak their phones is because the legitimate means was such a headache in which you had to contact the carrier and request a change, and even then they could refuse after several weeks of 'verification.' However, now with the slow introduction of apps that can essentially do all the work for you, within a matter of 48 hours, it really makes no sense to jailbreak. So now we'll tell you how to unlock iPhone 5c using an Online iPhone unlock tool called DoctorSIM Unlock Service.

SIM Unlock Service is really quite the revolutionary tool which just needs your IMEI code and can do all the work for you and send you the unlock code within a guaranteed period of 48 hours! It is safe, it is legal, it is hassle-free, and it doesn't even lapse your warranty, which proves that it is an officially approved means of unlocking your iPhone. However, before we tell you how to unlock iPhone 5, you should probably be able to verify if your phone is unlocked already.

## Part 4: How to unlock SIM Card on iPhone with iPhoneIMEI.net without jailbreak

[iPhoneIMEI.net](https://appleiphoneunlock.uk/network/Special%20Services/Activation%20Lock?aff=wondershare) uses an official method to unlock iPhone devices and whitelist your IMEI from Apple's database. Your iPhone will be unlocked automatically Over-The-Air, simply connect it to a Wifi network (Available for iOS 7, iOS 8, iOS 9, iOS 10 or higher, iOS 6 or lower should be unlocked by iTunes). So you don't need to send your iPhone to the network provider. The unlocked iPhone will never be relocked no matter you upgrade the OS or sync with iTunes.
