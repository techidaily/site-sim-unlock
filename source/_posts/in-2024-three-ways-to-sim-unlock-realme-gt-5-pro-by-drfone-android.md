## Three Ways to Sim Unlock Realme GT 5 Pro

You probably purchased your Realme GT 5 Pro for a significant discount but are now stuck with the same network for a couple of years. You loved the Realme GT 5 Pro device but your network provider does not have any plans that exactly suit your needs. To release your device from your current network's clutches, you will need to unlock your phone.

There are three ways you can do it and this post will go through each method so that you can find one that you are most comfortable with. Do note that if your contract has ended with your network provider, this "How to unlock Realme GT 5 Pro" post can be skipped as you can just ask them to unlock your phone or purchase a [sim network unlock pin](https://drfone.wondershare.com/unlock/unlock-samsung-sim-network-unlock-pin.html) for a minimal price.

## Part 1: Realme GT 5 Pro Unlock Code

This is probably the easiest, no-fuss method to [sim unlock](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/unlock-android-screen/) Realme GT 5 Pro. Follow these steps carefully to successfully perform Realme GT 5 Pro unlock code.

Do take note that this process may not work with your carrier. Therefore, always check if this is the right way to obtain the necessary code:

- 1\. Check the SIM lock status---you can do this by dialing **\*#\*#7378423#\*#\***.

![sony xperia unlock code](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2016/08/14707989592943.jpg)

![unlock with sony xperia unlock code](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2016/08/14707989592897.jpg)

- 3\. The number beside **Network** indicates how many attempts you have to unlock the phone. If it says '7' it means you have seven attempts; '0' simply means it is hard locked and cannot be unlocked using this method.

![unlock code sony xperia](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2016/08/14707989597664.jpg)

- 4\. Find the **IMEI number** by dialing **\*#06#**. Jot it down as this will be your code.

## Part 2: The Best Realme GT 5 Pro SIM Unlock Code Generator

To safely and successfully sim unlock your Realme GT 5 Pro, it is important to find a trustworthy [sim network unlock pin software](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/unlock-android-screen/).

Step 2. On the new window, fill in your phone IMEI number, model, your contact email, and other required information. Once your order is processed, the system will then send you the unlock code and instructions. You can follow the instruction to unlock your phone easily.

## Part 3: Realme GT 5 Pro Unlock Carrier

If your Realme GT 5 Pro is hard locked, this is your best bet in getting your device unlocked. Actually, it is the safest method among all three:

1. Get a new SIM card from a new carrier.
2. Call your carrier's customer service line and ask what are the requirements to qualify you to get your Realme GT 5 Pro unlocked. If you have honored your contract, there should not be any problems. However, do ask your carrier if there are any additional requirements. Do note that there may be fees involved.
3. Once your customer service representative has determined if you have met all their requirements, they should give you the SIM network unlock PIN Realme GT 5 Pro. Again, depending on your carrier, they might either give you the code over the phone, through email or via SMS. If you have the choice, always opt for email or SMS so that you are able to jot down the right number.
4. Once you have gotten the code, insert the new SIM card (from your new carrier). You will receive a prompt to enter your code. Make sure that you key in the right code---entering the wrong code will cause your phone to be locked (possibly forever).

## Part 6: The downside of an unlocked Realme GT 5 Pro

Are you thinking "Well, why can't I just buy an unlocked Realme GT 5 Pro in the first place?" right about now? Well, you can but think of the amount of money it will cost you.

## Conclusion

Now that you know the three ways of unlocking your Realme GT 5 Pro, all you need to do is find one that is most compatible with you. Just remember to think of everything through and carefully. Most importantly, if you have a locked device, always seek advice from your carrier to see if this is possible.

To use the Android SIM unlock code generator, you will need to download and install the software on your computer. Once installed, you will need to connect your Android phone to the computer using a USB cable. The software will then detect your phone and check if it is eligible for unlocking.

## Part 3. Benefits of Using Android SIM Unlock Code Generator

There are several benefits of using Android SIM unlock code generator. Some of these benefits are:

When your phone is carrier locked, you are limited to using only the carrier that the phone is locked to. This can be a problem if you travel frequently or want to switch to a different carrier. By unlocking your phone's SIM card, you will be able to use any carrier's SIM card, giving you the freedom to choose the carrier that best suits your needs.

- **2\. Cost savings**

By unlocking your phone's SIM card, you can save money on roaming charges when traveling. Instead of paying expensive roaming charges, you can simply purchase a local SIM card and use it in your unlocked phone. This can save you a lot of money in the long run.

- **3\. Resale value**

An unlocked phone has a higher resale value than a carrier-locked phone. This is because an unlocked phone can be used with any carrier's SIM card, making it more attractive to buyers.

- **4\. No need to buy a new phone**

If you want to switch to a different carrier, you may be tempted to buy a new phone that is compatible with that carrier. However, by unlocking your phone's SIM card, you can use your existing phone with any carrier's SIM card, saving you the cost of buying a new phone.

### Method 2: Unlocking With Your Carrier’s Official Methods

As mentioned earlier, carriers often provide official routes to unlock their devices. While typically requiring compliance with specific criteria, this method ensures you stay within your carrier’s policies.

Most carriers offer two common methods for unlocking their phones:

- **Paying an upfront fee.**If your contract period is still ongoing, certain carriers allow unlocking upon payment of a predetermined fee. Check your carrier’s website or contact customer support for eligibility and fee details.
- **Requesting a SIM unlock.**Once your contract has expired and you meet the carrier’s eligibility criteria (e.g., device payment completion), you can submit an official unlock request. Carriers typically have dedicated online portals or customer service channels for this process.

Remember, each carrier has its policies and procedures regarding unlocking. Consult your carrier’s official website or contact customer support for specific instructions and eligibility requirements.
