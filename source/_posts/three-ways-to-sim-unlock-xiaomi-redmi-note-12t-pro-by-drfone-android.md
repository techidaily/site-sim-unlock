## Three Ways to Sim Unlock Xiaomi Redmi Note 12T Pro

You probably purchased your Xiaomi Redmi Note 12T Pro for a significant discount but are now stuck with the same network for a couple of years. You loved the Xiaomi Redmi Note 12T Pro device but your network provider does not have any plans that exactly suit your needs. To release your device from your current network's clutches, you will need to unlock your phone.

There are three ways you can do it and this post will go through each method so that you can find one that you are most comfortable with. Do note that if your contract has ended with your network provider, this "How to unlock Xiaomi Redmi Note 12T Pro" post can be skipped as you can just ask them to unlock your phone or purchase a [sim network unlock pin](https://drfone.wondershare.com/unlock/unlock-samsung-sim-network-unlock-pin.html) for a minimal price.

## Part 1: Xiaomi Redmi Note 12T Pro Unlock Code

This is probably the easiest, no-fuss method to [sim unlock](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/unlock-android-screen/) Xiaomi Redmi Note 12T Pro. Follow these steps carefully to successfully perform Xiaomi Redmi Note 12T Pro unlock code.

Do take note that this process may not work with your carrier. Therefore, always check if this is the right way to obtain the necessary code:

1. Get a new SIM card from a new carrier.
2. Call your carrier's customer service line and ask what are the requirements to qualify you to get your Xiaomi Redmi Note 12T Pro unlocked.

You can also benefit from an unlocked Xiaomi Redmi Note 12T Pro if you are the kind of person who likes to take advantage of current offers provided by your local carriers. Prepaid plans are always changing in terms of offering so having the flexibility of changing carriers and prepaid plans can help you save money in the long run.

## Part 6: The downside of an unlocked Xiaomi Redmi Note 12T Pro

Are you thinking "Well, why can't I just buy an unlocked Xiaomi Redmi Note 12T Pro in the first place?" right about now? Well, you can but think of the amount of money it will cost you.

For example, in Australia, an unlocked Xiaomi Redmi Note 12T Pro will cost around $499 from any Xiaomi outlet but $0 for the Xiaomi Redmi Note 12T Pro device when you pair it with a 24-month postpaid plan. While this may look attractive now, you may be paying more for a locked Xiaomi Redmi Note 12T Pro in the long run.
