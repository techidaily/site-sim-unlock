## Part 2: 3 Ways to Find Unlocking Codes for iPhones

For iPhone users there is a way to get unlocking codes for free. This is a new form of payment known as TrialPay. The following three sites offer you the chance to trade tasks for unlock codes.

### 1\. Free Unlocks

Website URL: [https://www.freeunlocks.com/](https://www.freeunlocks.com/)

On this site you can trade a few tasks for iPhone unlock codes by choosing to pay via TrialPay. In fact the site offers you the chance to choose between paying in cash or via TrialPay.

To use it all you have to do is select the phone model and the phone type. You will then be required to enter your IMEI number and when you get to checkout, choose TrialPay to complete the order. You will complete a task and then get your codes delivered to your inbox.

### 2\. iPhoneIMEI

Website URL: [iPhoneIMEI.net](https://appleiphoneunlock.uk/network/Special%20Services/Activation%20Lock?aff=wondershare)

iPhoneIMEI.net uses an official method to unlock iPhone devices and whitelist your IMEI from Apple's database. Your iPhone will be unlocked automatically Over-The-Air, simply connect it to a Wifi network (Available for iOS 7, iOS 8, iOS 9, iOS 10 or higher, iOS 6 or lower should be unlocked by iTunes). So you don't need to send your iPhone to the network provider. The unlocked iPhone will never be relocked no matter you upgrade the OS or sync with iTunes.

## Part 3: Popular Youtube Video for Unlocking Your Oppo A58 4G

Here we've found a popular video on Youtube for you to follow and sim unlock your phone.

<iframe width="800" height="450" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/393YR8Hum5g" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0"></iframe>

It is very important to note that by unlocking your device you are breaching the contract you have with your service provider. Also, note that if the codes fail to work the first 4 times don't try to enter a fifth time as this will generally disable your device. This will mean that you will be unable to use the Oppo A58 4G device. Proceed with caution.
