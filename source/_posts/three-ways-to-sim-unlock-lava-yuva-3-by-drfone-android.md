## Three Ways to Sim Unlock Lava Yuva 3

You probably purchased your Lava Yuva 3 for a significant discount but are now stuck with the same network for a couple of years. You loved the Lava Yuva 3 device but your network provider does not have any plans that exactly suit your needs. To release your device from your current network's clutches, you will need to unlock your phone.

There are three ways you can do it and this post will go through each method so that you can find one that you are most comfortable with. Do note that if your contract has ended with your network provider, this "How to unlock Lava Yuva 3" post can be skipped as you can just ask them to unlock your phone or purchase a [sim network unlock pin](https://drfone.wondershare.com/unlock/unlock-samsung-sim-network-unlock-pin.html) for a minimal price.

## Part 1: Lava Yuva 3 Unlock Code

This is probably the easiest, no-fuss method to [sim unlock](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/unlock-android-screen/) Lava Yuva 3. Follow these steps carefully to successfully perform Lava Yuva 3 unlock code.

Do take note that this process may not work with your carrier. Therefore, always check if this is the right way to obtain the necessary code:

- 1\. Check the SIM lock status---you can do this by dialing **\*#\*#7378423#\*#\***.

![sony xperia unlock code](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2016/08/14707989592943.jpg)

- 2\. Tap **Service info** then **Sim lock**.

![unlock with sony xperia unlock code](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2016/08/14707989592897.jpg)

- 3\. The number beside **Network** indicates how many attempts you have to unlock the phone. If it says '7' it means you have seven attempts; '0' simply means it is hard locked and cannot be unlocked using this method.

![unlock code sony xperia](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2016/08/14707989597664.jpg)

- 4\. Find the **IMEI number** by dialing **\*#06#**. Jot it down as this will be your code.

![sony unlock code](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2016/08/14707998453087.jpg)

- 5\. Insert your new SIM card and tap in the IMEI number when it asks you for SIM network unlock PIN.

![sony unlock screen](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2016/08/unlock-screen.jpg)

If you have followed these steps to a tee, you should have unlocked your device. If you had to abort after Step 2, look at the other two methods below.

## Part 2: The Best Lava Yuva 3 SIM Unlock Code Generator

To safely and successfully sim unlock your Lava Yuva 3, it is important to find a trustworthy [sim network unlock pin software](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/unlock-android-screen/). Here I am going you present to you DoctorSIM - SIM Unlock Service. It definitely is one of the best sim unlocking code generators in the market. It helps you permanently sim unlock your phone so you can use it on any carrier provider you want in the world.

### How to use SIM Unlock Service

Step 1. Visit Doctor - SIM Unlock Service official website, click on the Select Your Lava Yuva 3 button, and then select Lava among all the phone brands.

Step 2. On the new window, fill in your phone IMEI number, model, your contact email, and other required information. Once your order is processed, the system will then send you the unlock code and instructions. You can follow the instruction to unlock your phone easily.

## Part 3: Lava Yuva 3 Unlock Carrier

If your Lava Yuva 3 is hard locked, this is your best bet in getting your device unlocked. Actually, it is the safest method among all three:

1. Get a new SIM card from a new carrier.
2. Call your carrier's customer service line and ask what are the requirements to qualify you to get your Lava Yuva 3 unlocked. If you have honored your contract, there should not be any problems. However, do ask your carrier if there are any additional requirements. Do note that there may be fees involved.
3. Once your customer service representative has determined if you have met all their requirements, they should give you the SIM network unlock PIN Lava Yuva 3. Again, depending on your carrier, they might either give you the code over the phone, through email or via SMS. If you have the choice, always opt for email or SMS so that you are able to jot down the right number.
4. Once you have gotten the code, insert the new SIM card (from your new carrier). You will receive a prompt to enter your code. Make sure that you key in the right code---entering the wrong code will cause your phone to be locked (possibly forever).

## Part 4: Lava Yuva 3 Unlock App/Software

There are some of us out there who are just not confident with doing things ourselves or trusting our own carrier.

HOWEVER, if your first instinct is to head to Google Play to look for SIM unlock tools, heed these cautions. There are currently many apps that claim that they can unlock your phone but it is just a scam. You should also avoid torrent files available online. These apps and software are usually laced with Trojans and other types of malware. So do sort through the reviews so that you will not fall into a malicious trap.

One that we can attest to is  **[MyMobileUnlocking.com](http://mymobileunlocking.com/)**; it is fast and affordable. Here is how you can unlock your Lava Yuva 3:

- Choose your Country from the dropdown menu and click the  **Confirm country** button.

![unlock sony xperia](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2016/08/14708923474346.jpg)

- Select your device's **Phone Brand** (Lava Ericsson) and click the **Confirm brand** button.

![sim unlock sony xperia](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2016/08/14708923461372.jpg)

- Once you are finished, click the **Place order** button.

![unlock sony xperia](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2016/08/14708923457478.jpg)

## Part 5: The benefits of an unlocked Lava Yuva 3

If you now know how to unlock Lava Yuva 3 but still do not know its advantages, we are here to help.

As indicated in the introduction, unlocked phone users can freely choose the plans they subscribed to---on any carriers, in any country. Therefore, if you travel frequently around the world, having an unlocked Lava Yuva 3 would be beneficial. Using a local SIM card is much cheaper than paying for exorbitant roaming charges.

You can also benefit from an unlocked Lava Yuva 3 if you are the kind of person who likes to take advantage of current offers provided by your local carriers. Prepaid plans are always changing in terms of offering so having the flexibility of changing carriers and prepaid plans can help you save money in the long run.

## Part 6: The downside of an unlocked Lava Yuva 3

Are you thinking "Well, why can't I just buy an unlocked Lava Yuva 3 in the first place?" right about now? Well, you can but think of the amount of money it will cost you.

For example, in Australia, an unlocked Lava Yuva 3 will cost around $499 from any Lava outlet but $0 for the Lava Yuva 3 device when you pair it with a 24-month postpaid plan. While this may look attractive now, you may be paying more for a locked Lava Yuva 3 in the long run.

## Conclusion

Now that you know the three ways of unlocking your Lava Yuva 3, all you need to do is find one that is most compatible with you. Just remember to think of everything through and carefully. Most importantly, if you have a locked device, always seek advice from your carrier to see if this is possible.
