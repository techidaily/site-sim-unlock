## How To Factory Unlock Your Telstra Apple iPhone 8

For many Australians, Telstra offers a convenient and reliable way to experience the iPhone’s innovative features. However, like most network providers, Telstra iPhones come locked, restricting their use of Telstra’s network. This might not be ideal for everyone, especially if you travel internationally, seek more competitive plans, or prefer the flexibility of switching carriers.

The good news is that unlocking your Telstra iPhone is straightforward, granting you the freedom to choose the network that best suits your needs. This guide will give you what you need to **unlock Telstra iPhones** and other phones. It will let you unlock your Apple iPhone 8’s full potential and navigate the exciting world of mobile network options.

For peace of mind and guaranteed success, unlocking your Telstra iPhone through Telstra’s official methods is the ideal choice. This straightforward approach ensures a smooth transition and adheres to carrier policies, eliminating potential complications. There are two main options offered to **unlock Telstra phones.**

### Option 1: Freedom After Two Years

If you’ve been loyal to Telstra and maintained a phone plan for 24 months or more, congratulations! You’re entitled to **unlock your Telstra phone for free**. This allows you to explore other networks without any additional cost. Contact Telstra through their app or phone; their friendly representatives will guide you through the process.

Remember that these fees are subject to change, so it’s always best to double-check with Telstra’s website or customer service for the latest information.

- **Step 2:** Use the My Telstra app under the “Get Help” section, call 125 8887 from a Telstra phone, 13 22 00 from a non-Telstra phone, or +61 439 125 888 if you’re overseas.
- **Step 3:** A Telstra representative will guide you through the process, explain any applicable fees, and assist you with payment if you are still within the 2-year period.

Before proceeding, it’s important to back up your phone data, as unlocking might erase it. Once complete, your Apple iPhone 8 will be network-lock-free, ready to embrace the world beyond Telstra.

While this information is current, visiting Telstra’s website or contacting their customer service for the latest fee structure and any policy updates is advisable. Also, note that this method can **unlock Telstra phones** other than iPhones.

## Method 2: How To Unlock iPhones With a Third-Party Phone Tool \[Recommended\]

For those seeking a potentially faster route to **unlock Telstra iPhones** or those who wish to avoid opening fees, third-party phone unlocking tools like Wondershare Dr.Fone present an alternative option. However, it’s crucial to consider the potential trade-offs before venturing down this path.

### A Quick Look at the Professional Phone Unlocking Tool: Wondershare Dr.Fone

[Wondershare Dr.Fone](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/drfone-toolkit/) is a comprehensive software suite catering to various smartphone needs, including data recovery, system repair, and device unlocking, which is relevant to our discussion. Developed by Wondershare, a reputable software company, it boasts user-friendly interfaces and compatibility with a wide range of iOS and Android devices.

![dr.fone my device page](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/connect-my-device-2.png)

Among Dr.Fone’s features lies the coveted “SIM Unlock” functionality. This tool aims to remove carrier-imposed restrictions, allowing your Telstra Apple iPhone 8 to work with other compatible networks. While seemingly convenient, it’s essential to understand the nuances before proceeding.

Dr.Fone’s SIM Unlock can bypass the carrier lock on your Apple iPhone 8, enabling it to operate with SIM cards from different networks.

### How Does Dr.Fone’s SIM Unlock Work?

The steps involved in using Dr.Fone’s SIM Unlock vary depending on your Apple iPhone 8 and iOS version.. Generally, the process involves connecting your Apple iPhone 8 to your computer, selecting the “SIM Unlock” function, and following the on-screen prompts. To be more specific, follow the steps below:

- **Step 1:** Download and install [Wondershare Dr.Fone](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/drfone-toolkit/) from the official website and launch it on your computer.


- **Step 2:** On the Dr.Fone homepage, go to **Toolbox > Screen Unlock > iOS**. Connect your Apple iPhone 8 with the appropriate cable, too.

![dr.fone homepage](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/drfone-home.png)

- **Step 3:** You’ll see several features on the Screen Unlock module. You can explore them, but for the purpose of this guide, click **Remove SIM Locked**.

![dr.fone screen unlock page](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/remove-iphone-sim-1.png)

- **Step 4:** Click **Start** when you see this page.
- **Step 5:** The program will detect your device details. Make sure that these are correct. Once done, click **Unlock Now**.

![dr.fone sim lock removal success](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/remove-iphone-sim-7.png)

**Disclaimer:** It’s vital to note that unlocking methods, particularly with third-party tools, may not always be successful, especially for newer iPhone models and iOS versions. Also, using third-party unlocking tools can void your phone’s warranty, leaving you responsible for any future repairs not covered by the manufacturer.

## Method 3: Using Online Unlockers To Unlock Telstra iPhones

While venturing into the online realm, you might encounter websites offering remote unlocking services for a fee. These services claim to **unlock your Telstra phone** quickly and conveniently, often without contacting the carrier. However, approaching this method requires extreme caution due to potential risks and legal implications.

Before diving in:

- **Understand the risks.**Online unlocking services operate in a gray area, potentially violating your carrier’s terms and conditions. This could lead to legal trouble or void your phone’s warranty.
- **Beware of scams.**Unfortunately, not all online unlocking services are legitimate. Many are scams designed to steal your money or personal information.
- **Do your research.**If you choose to proceed, thoroughly research the service provider. Read reviews from other users, check their track record, and ensure they have a good reputation.

These services typically require you to provide your phone’s IMEI number and pay a fee. They then claim to use various methods, often software or network vulnerabilities, to unlock your phone remotely. However, the success rate and security of these methods are highly questionable. Thus, relying on Dr.Fone as an alternative unlocking method is recommended.

## Conclusion

**Unlocking Telstra iPhones** gives you network flexibility, but navigating the process requires a measured approach. Remember, while Telstra’s official methods offer a guaranteed and secure path to freedom, third-party tools like Wondershare Dr.Fone present a potential avenue for those seeking alternative solutions.

After all, Wondershare Dr.Fone remains a valuable tool for your broader phone needs. From data recovery to system repair, its diverse functionalities can enhance your mobile experience in various ways. You can use it as an all-in-one application for all your needs, from network unlocking to system repair.
