## Part 1: Asking the Carrier to Unlock

One of the best options is getting in touch with the carrier and asking them to unlock the SIM locked phone. For that to happen, it is important to first know whether the phone is SIM locked and then whether the phone can be unlocked and if you are eligible to unlock the phone. There is an eligibility clause in contract for Smartphones bought on contract and if a specific time period is not up yet, then a termination fee is required to be paid by the user to break the contract in order to be able to use any SIM on the Google Pixel Fold device after getting the unlock code.

**_Pros_**

• This is the best way to unlock carrier locked devices.

• This is legal and everything happens based on the clause mentioned in the contract.

**_Cons  
_**

• Sometimes, even the network providers or carrier refuse to unlock Smartphone

• There is a certain time period which if not over yet, unlocking the phone would require termination fee.

## Part 2: Professional Reputable Smartphone Unlock Service

If you have tried out contacting the carrier and there is no way the carrier is unlocking your phone, you can opt for professional unlock service which could be of help. But finding such a professional service is not an easy task. There are some sites and service providers which require the IMEI number of the phone to create unlock codes. IMEI number of the phone is given to the professional SIM unlock service post which, they generate a special character combination which can be used to get the cell phone out of network restrictions. So, the phone can be unlocked remotely by using the special remote unlock codes.

Sometimes, the professional Smartphone service providers even ask for the phone to be sent to them to get the phone unlocked.

**_Pros_**

• This method could be opted as a last resort if there is no help from the carrier.

• Professional and reputable Smartphone unlock service providers tend to serve the purpose as they are specialized in this task.

• There are not many obligations involved.

**_Cons  
_**

• This might attract legal actions against the user.

• It is very difficult to find such professional Smartphone unlock service providers.

• Reliability on such service providers is also another factor which requires attention.

## Part 3: Unlock Android to Use Any SIM via Doctor SIM

Compared to connecting with your network provider, choosing an unlocking software may be a quicker and easier way. [Doctor SIM](https://www.doctorsim.com/gb-en/?scp) could be a good option. Let me introduce more about it.

**_Pros_**

- Providing more than 6 million unlocks securely in 15 years.
- Providing permanent remote service.
- Promising a refund if the unlock fails.

**_Cons_**

- Sometimes it may need even seven days.
- A 100% success rate cannot be guaranteed.
