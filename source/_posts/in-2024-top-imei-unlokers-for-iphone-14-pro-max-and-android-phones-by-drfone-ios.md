**Step6:** Before you can continue, you must first jailbreak your Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max. This method works on iPhones 5S to X running iOS 12.0 to 14.8.1. To learn about technology, you must either read the instruction or watch the video.

**Step7:** The following step is to perform a few quick tasks on your iOS device. Go to "Settings" and remove the SIM card from the smartphone. On each connection you've made in the "WLAN" section, tap "Forget This Network." After finishing, turn off "WLAN" and insert the SIM card into your iOS device. To continue with the procedure, click "Continue" on the screen.

## Contact Your Carrier to Unlock iPhone 8/8Plus

If your Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max is locked, then it must be for some reason. The carrier who has set this lock can provide the best solution.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### Check the unlock prerequisites

To check the unlock prerequisites, Go to Settings > General > About to find out if your Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max is locked. Your Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max is unlocked if it says "No SIM restrictions" next to "Carrier Lock."

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### Contact the carrier for the unlock code

Large cell phone companies often offer discounted devices to customers who sign an agreement for set time frames. Because of this, the Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max device comes with a controller lock so customers can only use it on their network. If your contract with the company is over, you can get out of it for free. Before you can unlock your Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max, you must meet the following requirements:

First of all, it must be a legal device. It means the Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max device is not reported as lost, stolen. Then your bank account must not have any financial debts. If you signed a contract in exchange for a lower up-front cost, you'd have to wait until your contract ends (usually 24 months) or pay the remaining balance if you purchased your phone on a payment schedule.

Most carriers need active accounts for specific days before unlocking devices. Sprint has 50 days, T-Mobile 40, and AT&T 60. Verizon has no minimum period if you need to factory reset your phone to use the new network and back up beforehand.

### Insert a new SIM card to unlock your device

If you have a non-carrier SIM card, complete iPhone unlocking using these steps:

- Turn off your device.
- SIM card out.
- Insert the new SIM. Your device will be activated.

### Conclusion

So, this was an overview of some popular unlocking tools for Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max. The most accurate and effective tool to unlock carrier-locked iPhones is Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock (iOS). If your Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max is locked, then it must be for some reason. The carrier who has set this lock can provide the best solution. However, Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock can unlock any lock.
