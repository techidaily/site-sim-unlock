## Part 2: Unlockitfree.com for free Itel unlock codes

Unlockitfree.com is a free remote unlock service, providing unlocking codes for Itel S23+ phones and other models. They offer a fast and free service, but it is not always reliable.

### How to use the Unlockitfree.com Unlock Service?

1\. First, enter your phoneâs unique IMEI into the site, and then the site checks to ensure that it is genuine.

2\. Choose your phone model from the list provided, and then choose your country. Once you choose your country, a list of supported Service Providers will pop up. Choose your service provider, read the terms and conditions and accept. At this point, click Generate.

3\. The Unlockitfree Generator will show you a series of 7 different unlocking codes. Not all of these will work; usually the best options are the 1st and 7th code on the list.

4\. Without removing your SIM card, input these codes into your phoneâs Home screen.

Hopefully you will have success â although, this is not guaranteed (as it is with the first Dr.Fone option above).
