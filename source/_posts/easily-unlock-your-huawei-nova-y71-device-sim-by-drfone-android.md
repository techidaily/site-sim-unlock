Prepaid plans are always changing in terms of offering so having the flexibility of changing carriers and prepaid plans can help you save money in the long run.

Are you thinking "Well, why can't I just buy an unlocked Huawei Nova Y71 in the first place?" right about now? Well, you can but think of the amount of money it will cost you.
