## Three Ways to Sim Unlock Vivo Y55s 5G (2023)

You probably purchased your Vivo Y55s 5G (2023) for a significant discount but are now stuck with the same network for a couple of years. You loved the Vivo Y55s 5G (2023) device but your network provider does not have any plans that exactly suit your needs. To release your device from your current network's clutches, you will need to unlock your phone.

There are three ways you can do it and this post will go through each method so that you can find one that you are most comfortable with. Do note that if your contract has ended with your network provider, this "How to unlock Vivo Y55s 5G (2023)" post can be skipped as you can just ask them to unlock your phone or purchase a [sim network unlock pin](https://drfone.wondershare.com/unlock/unlock-samsung-sim-network-unlock-pin.html) for a minimal price.

## Part 1: Vivo Y55s 5G (2023) Unlock Code

This is probably the easiest, no-fuss method to [sim unlock](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/unlock-android-screen/) Vivo Y55s 5G (2023). Follow these steps carefully to successfully perform Vivo Y55s 5G (2023) unlock code.

Do take note that this process may not work with your carrier. Therefore, always check if this is the right way to obtain the necessary code:
