3\. Restart iPhone.

### I don't have another SIM

In this case the process is a little longer. Do the following to activate the unlock:

#### **Step 1:** Back Up

You can back up easily with iCloud. It is a very simple solution. Simply go to settings on your Apple iPhone 8 Plus, followed by 'iCloud', then tap 'Back up now.'

#### **Step 2:** Erase iPhone

Go to Settings> General> Reset> Erase All Content. This will wipe your phone clean.

#### **Step 3:** Restore

Finally, just restore all the information from the iCloud back up. This is also fairly simple. As you follow the system setup after erasing, you'll be taken to the 'Apps & Data' screen. Simply select 'Restore from iCloud Backup.'

With that your Apple iPhone 8 Plus is now completely unlock activated! You're free to use it as you please now.

In this article we've explained how to unlock T Mobile Apple iPhone 8 Plus using DoctorSIM - SIM Unlock Service, and how to unlock T Mobile iPhone 5s using the T Mobile carrier itself. While both of them are perfectly legitimate means of unlocking your Apple iPhone 8 Pluss, I personally lean more towards the DoctorSIM solution as they don't have any pesky eligibility criteria, nor do they make you wait long. They are a 100% solution, especially considering they're a third-party tool which makes them less biased as they don't have an incentive to keep you from unlocking. Well, we hope this helped and hopefully now you have a T Mobile unlock iPhone!

### Unlock it via IMEI code

Contacting your carrier to unlock the sim lock on your Apple iPhone 8 Plus is legit and straightway. But before contacting your carrier, you must fulfill the following conditions.

- The device must be legal, which means the Apple iPhone 8 Plus device has not been reported as lost, stolen, or connected to a crime.
- You shouldn't have any debts in your bank account.
- If you signed a contract in exchange for a lower upfront price, you would have to wait until your contract expires (typically 24 months) or pay the remaining amount if you purchased your phone on a payment plan.

If you meet the above conditions, you can get the phone unlocked from your carrier. You have to provide them IMEI number of your device. However, the rest of the unlocking process is different for each company.
