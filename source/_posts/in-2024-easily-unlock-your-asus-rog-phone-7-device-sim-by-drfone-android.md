## Part 5: The benefits of an unlocked Asus ROG Phone 7

If you now know how to unlock Asus ROG Phone 7 but still do not know its advantages, we are here to help.

As indicated in the introduction, unlocked phone users can freely choose the plans they subscribed to---on any carriers, in any country. Therefore, if you travel frequently around the world, having an unlocked Asus ROG Phone 7 would be beneficial. Using a local SIM card is much cheaper than paying for exorbitant roaming charges.

You can also benefit from an unlocked Asus ROG Phone 7 if you are the kind of person who likes to take advantage of current offers provided by your local carriers. Prepaid plans are always changing in terms of offering so having the flexibility of changing carriers and prepaid plans can help you save money in the long run.

## Part 6: The downside of an unlocked Asus ROG Phone 7

Are you thinking "Well, why can't I just buy an unlocked Asus ROG Phone 7 in the first place?" right about now? Well, you can but think of the amount of money it will cost you.

For example, in Australia, an unlocked Asus ROG Phone 7 will cost around $499 from any Asus outlet but $0 for the Asus ROG Phone 7 device when you pair it with a 24-month postpaid plan. While this may look attractive now, you may be paying more for a locked Asus ROG Phone 7 in the long run.

## Conclusion

Now that you know the three ways of unlocking your Asus ROG Phone 7, all you need to do is find one that is most compatible with you. Just remember to think of everything through and carefully. Most importantly, if you have a locked device, always seek advice from your carrier to see if this is possible.
