## Ways To Find Unlocking Codes For Vivo S18 Pro Phones

When you have a locked device, it is pretty much impossible to move from one network to another. This would cause problems if for instance you wanted to travel outside the country and want to switch to that country's carrier for the duration of your stay. Or maybe you just want to switch carriers because you don't like your current provider.

Whatever the reason, you should be able to unlock your device easily. But this has often proven difficult because of the fact that you need unlock codes. The problem is that many sites promise free unlocking codes for your device and many turn out to be fraudulent sites that use the word "free" in their advertising but actually require you to pay for the service. If you have been unsuccessfully searching for free unlocking codes for your device, look no further. This article compiles three of the best for Android and iPhone.

**_How to Unlock your Android Phone_**

To begin with, you need to confirm your IMEI number. Dial \*#06# on your device and the IMEI number will appear on the screen. Copy this number to a secure location or wrote it down somewhere.
