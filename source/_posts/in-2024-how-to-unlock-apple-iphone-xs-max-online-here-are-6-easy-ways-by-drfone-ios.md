### How to unlock T Mobile iPhone 5s via T Mobile carrier

When you try to unlock T Mobile iPhone 5s directly through the carrier you are faced with a lot of restrictions and verification processes. Hence, to keep yourself from wasting your own time, you should go and read their page on eligibility to make sure you pass the test. Follow this link: support.t-mobile.com/docs/DOC-1588.

#### **Step 2:** Contact

Next you simply need to go to their Customer Care page and file a request for the unlock code. Follow the following link to contact them: <https://support.t-mobile.com/community/contact-us>. However you should bear in mind that they can reject any application at all.

![unlock t mobile iphone-unlock T Mobile iPhone 5s via T Mobile carrier](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2016/10/14772481095475.jpg)

Before you take some drastic and time consuming measures it might be helpful to confirm whether you already have an unlocked phone.

Finally, just restore all the information from the iCloud back up. This is also fairly simple. As you follow the system setup after erasing, you'll be taken to the 'Apps & Data' screen. Simply select 'Restore from iCloud Backup.'

![unlock t mobile iphone-restore iphone](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14772497801720.jpg)

With that your Apple iPhone XS Max is now completely unlock activated! You're free to use it as you please now.

In this article we've explained how to unlock T Mobile Apple iPhone XS Max using DoctorSIM - SIM Unlock Service, and how to unlock T Mobile iPhone 5s using the T Mobile carrier itself. While both of them are perfectly legitimate means of unlocking your Apple iPhone XS Maxs, I personally lean more towards the DoctorSIM solution as they don't have any pesky eligibility criteria, nor do they make you wait long. They are a 100% solution, especially considering they're a third-party tool which makes them less biased as they don't have an incentive to keep you from unlocking. Well, we hope this helped and hopefully now you have a T Mobile unlock iPhone!
