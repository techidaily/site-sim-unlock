### Contact your carrier to unlock it with the IMEI code

When a customer deals an agreement with a large cell phone company for a certain amount of time, they usually get a discount on a device. Because of this, the Apple iPhone 15 Pro device has a controller lock, so customers can only use it on their network. You can leave without paying anything if your contract with the company is over. Before you can unlock your Apple iPhone 15 Pro, you have to do the following:

First, it has to be legal. It means the Apple iPhone 15 Pro device has not been reported as lost, stolen, or linked to a crime.

Then your bank account shouldn't have any debts. If you signed a contract in exchange for a lower price upfront, you would have to wait until your contract was up (usually 24 months) or pay the remaining balance if you bought your phone on a payment plan. Each company has its way of unlocking.
