Because of this, the Apple iPhone 15 Plus device has a controller lock, so customers can only use it on their network. You can leave without paying anything if your contract with the company is over. Before you can unlock your Apple iPhone 15 Plus, you have to do the following:

First, it has to be legal. It means the Apple iPhone 15 Plus device has not been reported as lost, stolen, or linked to a crime.
