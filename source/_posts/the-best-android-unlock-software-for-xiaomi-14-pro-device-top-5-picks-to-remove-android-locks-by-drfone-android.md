_**Tips:** You're going on a trip to Frankfort, but forgot to unlock your iPhone. You need to unlock it first, because you will get a message: "This iPhone is locked and cannot be used with another carrier." I highly recommend using [Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock (iOS)](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/iphone-unlock/) to remove SIM lock if you have the need. This software is user-friendly, effective, and reliable, ensuring that your device is unlocked without any issues._
