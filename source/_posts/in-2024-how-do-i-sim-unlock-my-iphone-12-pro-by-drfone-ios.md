## How Do I SIM Unlock My Apple iPhone 12 Pro?

If your Apple iPhone 12 Pro is locked to a particular carrier, it can be very frustrating. This is because your device will only be able to work with a SIM card from that provider and no other. This can be a problem when you want to change carriers. Some iPhones are generally easier to unlock than others, and the easiest way to unlock any iPhone is usually to use a paid online service. The issue is that these services can be very expensive.

In this article, we are going to look at how you can [sim unlock](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/unlock-android-screen/) your Apple iPhone 12 Pro. It is however important to note that if you purchased your device in the last one year, it is already unlocked.

Many people may wonder whether it is legal to unlock the iPhone. Actually, it is perfectly legal to unlock your Apple iPhone 12 Pro if you have completed payments on the contract, or you bought the Apple iPhone 12 Pro device outright. If however, you are still in the process of paying for your contract, you don't fully own the phone and so you should contact the carrier before unlocking it.

But if your Apple iPhone 12 Pro has [bad ESN](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/iphone-unlock/) or been blacklisted by the carrier, you can check the new post here to check what to do if you have a [blacklisted iPhone](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/iphone-unlock/).

##  Part 1: How to SIM Unlock Your Apple iPhone 12 Pro?

There are several ways to unlock your device. Let's look at a few of them.

### 1\. Contact your Carrier and Have them unlock the Apple iPhone 12 Pro device for you

This is probably the safest way to do it. If you have already completed payments on your Apple iPhone 12 Pro or you bought it outright, you can ask your carrier for the [sim network unlock pin](https://drfone.wondershare.com/unlock/unlock-samsung-sim-network-unlock-pin.html) to unlock your device. Depending on your carrier, you may have to pay for this service, and it also does take up to 7 days, sometimes more for them to get back to you.

### 2\. Software Unlocking

This is where you download a piece of [sim network unlock pin software](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/unlock-android-screen/) on to your device. This software makes changes to the Apple iPhone 12 Pro device, allowing you to make calls from any carrier. While this may sound straight-forward and easy, except it is highly risky and will not work for iPhone 4 and later models.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### 3\. Hardware Unlocking

This is where you alter the hardware of the Apple iPhone 12 Pro device to create an alternate path to deliver calls. Although this can be done, it also alters your device irreparably and probably also voids your warranty. Not to mention, you may pay more than $200 to have the Apple iPhone 12 Pro device unlocked in this way.

### 4\. IMEI unlocking

This is the best way to unlock your device and by far the easiest. This method uses your device's IMEI number to access the IMEI database and change the status of the Apple iPhone 12 Pro from locked to unlocked. There are very many services that you can use to IMEI unlock your device, and most of them will offer the service for a fee. But this is a great solution because there is no software to download, and you don't mess with the hardware in any way.

## Part 2: The Best SIM Unlock Service - Dr.Fone

A SIM unlock PIN is an effective way to remove your SIM lock effectively. However, it may not work sometimes.

If your Apple iPhone 12 Pro is X/8(Plus)/7(Plus)/SE/6S(Plus)/6(Plus)/5S, luckily, I will introduce an amazing software to help unlock your SIM card permanently. That is [Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock (iOS)](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/iphone-unlock/).

## Part 2: How to unlock AT&T iPhone using iPhoneIMEI.net

[iPhoneIMEI.net](https://appleiphoneunlock.uk/network/Special%20Services/Activation%20Lock?aff=wondershare) is a great iPhone Unlock Service by which you can factory unlock pretty much any iPhone working on any OS at all, all without jailbreaking. One of the many unique and cool features about this is that you no longer have to worry about iOS upgrade or syncing it to iTunes, because your Apple iPhone 12 Pro will never be relocked.Also, your warranty remains intact with this. Here's how you can go about making use of this iPhone unlock service.

![sim unlock iphone with iphoneimei.net](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2016/06/14670574228916.jpg)

On [iPhoneIMEI.net](https://appleiphoneunlock.uk/network/Special%20Services/Activation%20Lock?aff=wondershare) official website, just select your Apple iPhone 12 Pro model and the network carrier your iphone is locked to, it will direct you to another page. Once you have followed the page instruction to finish the order, iPhone IMEI will submit your Apple iPhone 12 Pro IMEI to the carrier provider and whitelist your device from Apple database. It usually takes 1-5 days. After it's unlocked, you will receive an email notification.

This is an alternative means by which you can AT&T unlock iPhone. It is a tad more cumbersome and may take a little more time, but is another legitimate means you could opt for should you wish to do so. This is done by directly getting in contact with your Carrier. If you already know that your carrier is AT&T, you can contact them directly and get your Apple iPhone 12 Pro unlocked as follows:

#### **Step 1:** Go to their Site and Contact them

1\. Go to [https://www.att.com/deviceunlock/?#/](https://www.att.com/deviceunlock/?#/) first. This is the official location whereby you can contact them.

2\. The page will list out certain eligibility requirements. You have to read and agree to them before clicking 'Continue.'

### Requirements

However, AT&T has the right to dismiss anyone's request based on several requirements and criteria, so your application may yet be either rejected or you may have to go through further steps. It is a good idea to go through their requirements before you fill their form.

1\. The obvious requirement is that your Apple iPhone 12 Pro must be locked to AT&T, else you should go to the relevant carrier page.

2\. You iPhone couldn't have been reported as either lost or stolen.

3\. No record of it having been linked to any criminal or fraudulent activities.

4\. All termination fees have been paid in full, and all the other iPhone installment plans, etc, have been completed.

5\. After upgrading iPhone you must wait 14 days before you're eligible for unlock.

Finding out how to unlock AT&T iPhone can be harrowing if you don't know where to look, especially because performing the unlock can be so crucial for many people in order to access other carriers.

Both the options mentioned above offer a legitimate means by which you can AT&T unlock your Apple iPhone 12 Pro, whether done without a SIM card or by contacting the AT&T carrier.

However, going by personal experience the DoctorSIM alternative offers a much smoother, efficient and quicker alternative to contacting the AT&T carriers. It is also more secure because if you are going via the carrier without a SIM card then you'll need to back up your Apple iPhone 12 Pro, then delete and restore it as well (for security measures). This isn't just a time consuming process, but it can also prove to be risky. Furthermore, AT&T has a lot of checks and requisites in place which can keep your Apple iPhone 12 Pro from being unlocked, and even if you do pass the requisites it's still a time-consuming process which may still be rejected as AT&T has final say. As such, going via DoctorSIM gives you complete agency and conveniently AT&T unlocks iPhone without any data loss, through a simple 3 step process.
