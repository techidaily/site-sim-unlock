## Part 5: The benefits of an unlocked Xiaomi Redmi K70E

If you now know how to unlock Xiaomi Redmi K70E but still do not know its advantages, we are here to help.

As indicated in the introduction, unlocked phone users can freely choose the plans they subscribed to---on any carriers, in any country. Therefore, if you travel frequently around the world, having an unlocked Xiaomi Redmi K70E would be beneficial. Using a local SIM card is much cheaper than paying for exorbitant roaming charges.

You can also benefit from an unlocked Xiaomi Redmi K70E if you are the kind of person who likes to take advantage of current offers provided by your local carriers. Prepaid plans are always changing in terms of offering so having the flexibility of changing carriers and prepaid plans can help you save money in the long run.

Are you thinking "Well, why can't I just buy an unlocked Xiaomi Redmi K70E in the first place?" right about now? Well, you can but think of the amount of money it will cost you.
