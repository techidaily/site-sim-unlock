## The Ultimate Guide to Unlocking Your Apple iPhone 11 Pro on MetroPCS

If you own an iPhone that is MetroPCS-branded, the carrier will probably lock it, making it impossible to use a SIM from another carrier on the Apple iPhone 11 Pro device. Therefore, you will have to unlock iPhone MetroPCS for this purpose.

Many people find it difficult to unlock their MetroPCS iPhone and resort to buying a new phone altogether to use it with another service provider. In this article, you will learn how to use the MetroPCS unlock phones feature with three different methods. So, let’s get started!

### 1\. Calling MetroPCS to Unlock Phones

The first and most straightforward method to carrier unlocks MetroPCS phone is to call the company. But before you do that, make sure whether your phone has GSM/LTE or CDMA technology. Check for the small slot on the side of your phone to see whether there’s a SIM.

If your phone does not have a SIM, it uses CDMA technology. You will have to call your new carrier company and request them to unlock your phone in such a case. However, if you find a SIM card, your phone works on GSM or LTE and can easily be unlocked by contacting MetroPCS customer care.

Here’s how to do that:

**Step 1**

Call 1-888-863-8768 to reach the MetroPCS customer service, and request a MetroPCS network unlock code.

**Step 2**

They might ask you to provide your phone number, name on the MetroPCS account, email address, and PIN. Therefore, keep this information at hand.

**Step 3**

They will send you a confirmation email within 2 to 3 business days, containing the MetroPCS unlock code and instructions on how to use it.

**Step 4**

The instructions involve turning off your phone, inserting the SIM card of the new carrier, and entering the provided code when prompted. And that’s how you unlock your MetroPCS phone for free via the official method.

The downside of this method is again the time consumption. You have to call and wait for your turn, answer a bunch of questions, and wait for several days before receiving a confirmation email. If you want to save all this time, you can unlock iPhone MetroPCS for free using a more time-efficient method, i.e., using an unlock tool like [Dr.Fone – Sim Unlock](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/iphone-unlock/).

### 2\. Unlock iPhone MetroPCS with an Unlock Tool
