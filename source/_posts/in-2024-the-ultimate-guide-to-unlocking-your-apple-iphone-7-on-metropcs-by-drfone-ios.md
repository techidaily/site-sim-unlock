## The Ultimate Guide to Unlocking Your Apple iPhone 7 on MetroPCS

If you own an iPhone that is MetroPCS-branded, the carrier will probably lock it, making it impossible to use a SIM from another carrier on the Apple iPhone 7 device. Therefore, you will have to unlock iPhone MetroPCS for this purpose.

Many people find it difficult to unlock their MetroPCS iPhone and resort to buying a new phone altogether to use it with another service provider. In this article, you will learn how to use the MetroPCS unlock phones feature with three different methods. So, let’s get started!

### 1\. Calling MetroPCS to Unlock Phones

The first and most straightforward method to carrier unlocks MetroPCS phone is to call the company. But before you do that, make sure whether your phone has GSM/LTE or CDMA technology. Check for the small slot on the side of your phone to see whether there’s a SIM.

If your phone does not have a SIM, it uses CDMA technology. You will have to call your new carrier company and request them to unlock your phone in such a case. However, if you find a SIM card, your phone works on GSM or LTE and can easily be unlocked by contacting MetroPCS customer care.

Here’s how to do that:

**Step 1**

Call 1-888-863-8768 to reach the MetroPCS customer service, and request a MetroPCS network unlock code.

**Step 2**

They might ask you to provide your phone number, name on the MetroPCS account, email address, and PIN. Therefore, keep this information at hand.

**Step 3**

They will send you a confirmation email within 2 to 3 business days, containing the MetroPCS unlock code and instructions on how to use it.

**Step 4**

The instructions involve turning off your phone, inserting the SIM card of the new carrier, and entering the provided code when prompted. And that’s how you unlock your MetroPCS phone for free via the official method.

The downside of this method is again the time consumption. You have to call and wait for your turn, answer a bunch of questions, and wait for several days before receiving a confirmation email. If you want to save all this time, you can unlock iPhone MetroPCS for free using a more time-efficient method, i.e., using an unlock tool like [Dr.Fone – Sim Unlock](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/iphone-unlock/).

## Method 3: Using Online Unlockers To Unlock Telstra iPhones

While venturing into the online realm, you might encounter websites offering remote unlocking services for a fee. These services claim to **unlock your Telstra phone** quickly and conveniently, often without contacting the carrier. However, approaching this method requires extreme caution due to potential risks and legal implications.

Before diving in:

- **Understand the risks.**Online unlocking services operate in a gray area, potentially violating your carrier’s terms and conditions. This could lead to legal trouble or void your phone’s warranty.
- **Beware of scams.**Unfortunately, not all online unlocking services are legitimate. Many are scams designed to steal your money or personal information.
- **Do your research.**If you choose to proceed, thoroughly research the service provider. Read reviews from other users, check their track record, and ensure they have a good reputation.

These services typically require you to provide your phone’s IMEI number and pay a fee. They then claim to use various methods, often software or network vulnerabilities, to unlock your phone remotely. However, the success rate and security of these methods are highly questionable. Thus, relying on Dr.Fone as an alternative unlocking method is recommended.

## Conclusion

**Unlocking Telstra iPhones** gives you network flexibility, but navigating the process requires a measured approach. Remember, while Telstra’s official methods offer a guaranteed and secure path to freedom, third-party tools like Wondershare Dr.Fone present a potential avenue for those seeking alternative solutions.

After all, Wondershare Dr.Fone remains a valuable tool for your broader phone needs. From data recovery to system repair, its diverse functionalities can enhance your mobile experience in various ways. You can use it as an all-in-one application for all your needs, from network unlocking to system repair.
