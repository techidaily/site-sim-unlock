This can be particularly useful when buying a used mobile device or trying to recover a lost or stolen one. Some IMEI analyzers may also provide additional features such as warranty status checks, carrier information, and SIM lock status.

This is probably the easiest, no-fuss method to [sim unlock](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/unlock-android-screen/) Infinix Hot 40i. Follow these steps carefully to successfully perform Infinix Hot 40i unlock code.

![sony xperia unlock code](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2016/08/14707989592943.jpg)

3. Once your customer service representative has determined if you have met all their requirements, they should give you the SIM network unlock PIN Infinix Hot 40i. Again, depending on your carrier, they might either give you the code over the phone, through email or via SMS.

## Part 6: The downside of an unlocked Infinix Hot 40i

Are you thinking "Well, why can't I just buy an unlocked Infinix Hot 40i in the first place?" right about now? Well, you can but think of the amount of money it will cost you.

For example, in Australia, an unlocked Infinix Hot 40i will cost around $499 from any Infinix outlet but $0 for the Infinix Hot 40i device when you pair it with a 24-month postpaid plan. While this may look attractive now, you may be paying more for a locked Infinix Hot 40i in the long run.

Now that you know the three ways of unlocking your Infinix Hot 40i, all you need to do is find one that is most compatible with you. Just remember to think of everything through and carefully. Most importantly, if you have a locked device, always seek advice from your carrier to see if this is possible.
