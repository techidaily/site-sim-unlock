## How To Unlock Apple iPhone 12 Pro: Official Method to Unlock Your Apple iPhone 12 Pro

Restriction on the use of a SIM card by a carrier often creates a lot of problems. The barrier that you can't use another company's SIM somehow makes you feel like you're not the only owner of the phone. But you don't need to worry anymore because you are in the right place to know about the way use to unlock your Apple iPhone 12 Pro.

This article is about the official way to get your Apple iPhone 12 Pro unlocked from your carrier. But we also have a solution if you want to avoid contacting your carrier.

## Part 1: What Should You Do Before Apple iPhone 12 Pro SIM Unlock?

Before unlocking your Apple iPhone 12 Pro from the carrier, you should fulfill the following criteria.

### 1\. No Due Before Unlocking

When iPhone users sign contracts with a giant cell phone company for a certain amount of time, they often get a discount on a device. Because of this, the Apple iPhone 12 Pro device comes with a controller lock so customers can only use it on their network.

So, if you've paid off your contract or bought your Apple iPhone 12 Pro without a subsidy, it's perfectly legal to unlock it. But if you're still paying off your contract, you still need to own the Apple iPhone 12 Pro fully, so you should confirm with your carrier before unlocking it.

### 2\. You Should Buy It for More Than the Time Limit in the Contract

You can leave without paying anything if your agreement with the company is over. If you signed a contract in exchange for a lower price upfront, you would have to wait until your contract ended (usually 24 months) or pay the remaining balance if you bought your phone on a payment plan.

### Examples: Requirements of Sim Unlock of T-Mobile/EE/AT&T

T-Mobile, EE, and AT&T have common requirements before you can unlock your Apple iPhone 12 Pro.

- It has to be legal. It means the Apple iPhone 12 Pro device has not been reported as lost, stolen, or linked to a crime.
- Your bank account shouldn't have any debts.
- If you signed a contract in exchange for a lower price upfront, you would have to wait until your contract was up (usually 24 months) or pay the remaining balance if you bought your phone on a payment plan.

Apart from the requirements mentioned above, each company has its way of unlocking.

- If you meet the above requirements, you can call customer service at 611 from the Apple iPhone 12 Pro device you want to unlock to unlock an iPhone 11 or 12 that is locked to a T-Mobile network.

## What is iPhone Unlock Chip?
