The International Mobile Equipment Identity (IMEI) is a unique identifier for every mobile device.

Changing your device's IMEI can help to unblock a blacklisted device, access certain network features and services, or maintain anonymity.

### There are several uses of the IMEI number

1. As the use of mobile devices increases, the statistics of stolen and lost devices have been increasing as well. Users can block stolen or lost devices for further usage if they know their IMEI number. All users need to call their network carrier and report that the Oppo Find N3 Flip device is stolen or lost. The carrier can block the specific device from running on their network and notify other carriers.
2. The 15-digit IMEI number indicates the origin and model of the Oppo Find N3 Flip device. The first eight digits indicate the Oppo Find N3 Flip device's origin and its model while the last six digits identify the Oppo Find N3 Flip device's manufacturer.
3. If you subscribe to a mobile tracking service, you can use the IMEI number to track the Oppo Find N3 Flip device---even if it uses a different SIM card.

### Pros and Cons of Changing Android IMEI

Like many other things out there, changing Android IMEI has both advantages and disadvantages. Here are some of them:

**Advantages**

So if you changed your IMEI and lost it, you may not be able to claim it. This is because authorities cannot see if it is truly yours. After all, the IMEI numbers no longer correlate with each other.

The IMEI is embedded into the hardware of the Oppo Find N3 Flip device. It is typically printed on the Oppo Find N3 Flip device's packaging or can be found by dialing \*#06# on the phone's keypad.
