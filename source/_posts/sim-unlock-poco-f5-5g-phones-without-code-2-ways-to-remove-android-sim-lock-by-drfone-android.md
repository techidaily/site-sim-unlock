### There are several uses of the IMEI number

1. As the use of mobile devices increases, the statistics of stolen and lost devices have been increasing as well. Users can block stolen or lost devices for further usage if they know their IMEI number. All users need to call their network carrier and report that the Poco F5 5G device is stolen or lost. The carrier can block the specific device from running on their network and notify other carriers.
2. The 15-digit IMEI number indicates the origin and model of the Poco F5 5G device. The first eight digits indicate the Poco F5 5G device's origin and its model while the last six digits identify the Poco F5 5G device's manufacturer.
3. If you subscribe to a mobile tracking service, you can use the IMEI number to track the Poco F5 5G device---even if it uses a different SIM card.

1. Before we begin, we need to make it clear that the process of changing IMEI without root can be illegal in some countries. We advise you to check the laws and regulations in your country before attempting to change your device’s IMEI number. As far as we know, it is legal in Africa and Asia, and illegal in Europe.
2. The IMEI number is hardcoded into your device. Therefore, changing your device’s IMEI number may void your device warranty and cause other issues such as network problems and software instability.
3. Legally, you have forfeited your ownership of your mobile device. When you purchase your device, the seller will jot down the original IMEI number on your receipt. So if you changed your IMEI and lost it, you may not be able to claim it. This is because authorities cannot see if it is truly yours. After all, the IMEI numbers no longer correlate with each other.

### Method 4: Find IMEI on a Removable Battery (for older devices)

For older Android devices with removable batteries, you can find the IMEI number printed on a sticker underneath the battery. To locate it, follow these steps:

![find imei number 06](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/05/find-imei-on-a-removable-battery.jpg)

Some Android devices have the IMEI number printed on the SIM card tray. To check if your device has this feature:

![check- -sim card tray](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/05/check-device-sim-card-tray.jpg)

- **Step 1:** Power off your Android device.
- **Step 2:** Use the SIM card removal tool (or a paperclip) to eject the SIM card tray.
- **Step 3:** Look for the IMEI number printed on the tray.
- **Step 4:** Note it down or take a photo for reference.

## Part 3: Does IMEI Change With SIM Card?

No, swapping or changing the SIM card does not alter the IMEI (International Mobile Equipment Identity). The IMEI persists unchanged throughout the Poco F5 5G device's lifetime, functioning as a distinctive identifier solely for that particular device.

The IMEI is a 15-digit code assigned to each mobile device. It's separate from the SIM card, which stores information related to the subscriber and the carrier network. The SIM card contains data specific to the subscriber. This includes contacts, text messages, and network-related information. But it does not alter or affect the IMEI of the Poco F5 5G device.

The IMEI remains the same even if you change SIM cards or switch between different carriers. It's essentially a static identifier tied to the Poco F5 5G device's hardware. It is used by mobile networks and authorities to identify and track devices on the network.

## Part 4: Does IMEI Change After Factory Reset?

No, performing a factory reset on your mobile device does not change its IMEI (International Mobile Equipment Identity). The IMEI is a unique identifier assigned to the hardware of the Poco F5 5G device. It remains constant throughout the life of the Poco F5 5G device, irrespective of any software changes or resets.

A factory reset wipes the data and settings on your device, returning it to its original factory state. This process erases user-installed apps, personal data, and settings. But it doesn’t affect the Poco F5 5G device's hardware identification, including the IMEI.

The IMEI is embedded into the hardware of the Poco F5 5G device. It is typically printed on the Poco F5 5G device's packaging or can be found by dialing \*#06# on the phone's keypad. It's a crucial identifier for mobile networks, and authorities use it to uniquely identify and track devices across networks. It remains unchanged even after a factory reset.

## Part 5: Requirements for Changing Android IMEI without Root

- **A compatible Android device:** The methods detailed in this guide are specifically for MediaTek (MTK) devices. Ensure that your device has a MediaTek chipset before proceeding..
