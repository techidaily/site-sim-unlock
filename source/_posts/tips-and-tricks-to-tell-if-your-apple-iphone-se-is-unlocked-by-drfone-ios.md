### Unlock it via IMEI code

Contacting your carrier to unlock the sim lock on your Apple iPhone SE is legit and straightway. But before contacting your carrier, you must fulfill the following conditions.

- The device must be legal, which means the Apple iPhone SE device has not been reported as lost, stolen, or connected to a crime.
- You shouldn't have any debts in your bank account.
- If you signed a contract in exchange for a lower upfront price, you would have to wait until your contract expires (typically 24 months) or pay the remaining amount if you purchased your phone on a payment plan.

If you meet the above conditions, you can get the phone unlocked from your carrier. You have to provide them IMEI number of your device. However, the rest of the unlocking process is different for each company.
