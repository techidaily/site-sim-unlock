- First, the Apple iPhone 13 Pro device must be legal. It means the Apple iPhone 13 Pro device has not been reported as lost, stolen, or connected to a crime.
- Then you shouldn't have any debts in your bank account.
- If you signed a contract in exchange for a lower price upfront, you would have to wait until your contract ended (usually 24 months) or pay the remaining balance if you bought your phone on a payment plan.

Note: the unlocking process is different for each company.

**How to unlock the Apple iPhone 13 Pro locked by AT&T**

First, you need to know that AT&T limits how many devices a customer can unlock in a given year. Customers can unlock up to five devices per year if their account is in great condition.

With that your Apple iPhone 13 Pro is now completely unlock activated! You're free to use it as you please now.

In this article we've explained how to unlock T Mobile Apple iPhone 13 Pro using DoctorSIM - SIM Unlock Service, and how to unlock T Mobile iPhone 5s using the T Mobile carrier itself. While both of them are perfectly legitimate means of unlocking your Apple iPhone 13 Pros, I personally lean more towards the DoctorSIM solution as they don't have any pesky eligibility criteria, nor do they make you wait long. They are a 100% solution, especially considering they're a third-party tool which makes them less biased as they don't have an incentive to keep you from unlocking. Well, we hope this helped and hopefully now you have a T Mobile unlock iPhone!
