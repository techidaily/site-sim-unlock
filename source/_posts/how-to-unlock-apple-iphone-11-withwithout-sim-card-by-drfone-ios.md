### Method 2: Using an R-SIM

An R-SIM, or SIM interposer, acts as a bridge between your [<u>SIM card</u>](https://drfone.wondershare.com/sim-unlock/free-sim-network-unlock-pin.html) and the iPhone's hardware. It enables you to input the ICCID code and access a wider range of carrier options. This method is particularly useful if you're looking for a seamless and reliable way to configure your Apple iPhone 11's network settings. Below, we have gone through the steps of using an R-SIM to input the ICCID code:

- **Step 1:** Begin by inserting the R-SIM card into your Apple iPhone 11's SIM card tray. Ensure it is properly positioned and securely placed. For R-SIM versions starting from 14 and above, there's no need to manually dial a code. Upon inserting the R-SIM card, the Apple iPhone 11 device will automatically prompt you with a menu.
- **Step 2:** However, for earlier versions, open the Call app on your Apple iPhone 11. Dial 50057672\*00# and initiate the call. This action will trigger the appearance of the R-SIM menu. Once the R-SIM menu is visible, select the option labeled "Edit ICCID."
- **Step 3:** Now, enter the ICCID unlock code you got from the website mentioned above. With the new ICCID successfully entered, restart your Apple iPhone 11. After the reboot, your Apple iPhone 11 will recognize the updated ICCID and establish a connection with the desired network.
