With that your Apple iPhone 12 Pro Max is now completely unlock activated! You're free to use it as you please now.

In this article we've explained how to unlock T Mobile Apple iPhone 12 Pro Max using DoctorSIM - SIM Unlock Service, and how to unlock T Mobile iPhone 5s using the T Mobile carrier itself. While both of them are perfectly legitimate means of unlocking your Apple iPhone 12 Pro Maxs, I personally lean more towards the DoctorSIM solution as they don't have any pesky eligibility criteria, nor do they make you wait long. They are a 100% solution, especially considering they're a third-party tool which makes them less biased as they don't have an incentive to keep you from unlocking.

## How to Check iPhone SIM Lock Status?

Before you try any other solution, you should check the nature of the Lock on your Apple iPhone 12 Pro Max. Once you know the problem, you can move on to the right solution.

### 1\. Contact your service provider

Apple has added a new Network Provider Lock section to iOS 14 that immediately tells you the Apple iPhone 12 Pro Max device's status.

Scroll down to find the section called "Network Provider Lock." If the Apple iPhone 12 Pro Max is unlocked, it should say "No SIM restrictions" on the screen. If you see something different, it means the Apple iPhone 12 Pro Max is locked.
