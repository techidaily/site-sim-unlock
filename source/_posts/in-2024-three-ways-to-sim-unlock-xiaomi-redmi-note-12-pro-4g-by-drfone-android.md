## Part 1: SIM Unlock Service

SIM Unlock Service is one of the best and trust-worthy SIM unlock code generators available on the market. This is not a free option, but it is so effective that many users find it is worth the price. It saves you so much hassle that it is worth the small upfront fee. Doctorsim will permanently unlock your phone, enabling you to use your phone on all carriers around the world. Most importantly, using DoctorSim will not void your warranty.

### How to use DoctorSim SIM Unlock Service to unlock Xiaomi Redmi Note 12 Pro 4G phones?

Step 1. Go to [DoctorSim's official website](https://www.doctorsim.com/libtrkafl.html?pc=43d47c30d945bcbd7d9527f4049f649a&refe=https://www.doctorsim.com/us-en/?scp&euro), so you know that you can trust it. Click on the ‘Select Your Xiaomi Redmi Note 12 Pro 4G’ button, and then select Xiaomi from the list of brands.

Step 2. Fill in your phone’s information and your contact details in the following window, including the phone IMEI, phone model, and your email. Once your order is processed, the system will send you your personalized unlock code and unlocking instructions. You can then follow the instructions to unlock your Xiaomi Redmi Note 12 Pro 4G phone.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### How to use the Unlockitfree.com Unlock Service?

1\. First, enter your phone’s unique IMEI into the site, and then the site checks to ensure that it is genuine.

2\. Choose your phone model from the list provided, and then choose your country. Once you choose your country, a list of supported Service Providers will pop up. Choose your service provider, read the terms and conditions and accept. At this point, click Generate.

3\. The Unlockitfree Generator will show you a series of 7 different unlocking codes. Not all of these will work; usually the best options are the 1st and 7th code on the list.

4\. Without removing your SIM card, input these codes into your phone’s Home screen.

Hopefully you will have success – although, this is not guaranteed (as it is with the first Dr.Fone option above).
