On [iPhoneIMEI.net](https://appleiphoneunlock.uk/network/Special%20Services/Activation%20Lock?aff=wondershare) official website, just select your Apple iPhone 12 Pro Max model and the network carrier your iphone is locked to, it will direct you to another page. Once you have followed the page instruction to finish the order, iPhone IMEI will submit your Apple iPhone 12 Pro Max IMEI to the carrier provider and whitelist your device from Apple database. It usually takes 1-5 days. After it's unlocked, you will receive an email notification.

This is an alternative means by which you can AT&T unlock iPhone. It is a tad more cumbersome and may take a little more time, but is another legitimate means you could opt for should you wish to do so. This is done by directly getting in contact with your Carrier. If you already know that your carrier is AT&T, you can contact them directly and get your Apple iPhone 12 Pro Max unlocked as follows:

#### **Step 1:** Go to their Site and Contact them

1\. Go to [https://www.att.com/deviceunlock/?#/](https://www.att.com/deviceunlock/?#/) first. This is the official location whereby you can contact them.

2\. The page will list out certain eligibility requirements. You have to read and agree to them before clicking 'Continue.'

![unlock att iphone via att carrier](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2016/10/14769325349486.jpg)

3\. Next, you have to fill up the Request Form, including details about your Wireless number.

![fill the form to unlock iphone att](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2016/10/14769326985388.jpg)

#### **Step 2:** Email confirmation

1\. You'll receive the unlock request number via email.

2\. You need to click on the provided link within 24 hours in order for your unlock request to be officially accepted.

#### **Step 3:** Response

1\. You should hear back from AT&T within 2 days.

2\. If your request has been successful, they'll send you further instructions about how to unlock your Apple iPhone 12 Pro Max.

### Requirements

However, AT&T has the right to dismiss anyone's request based on several requirements and criteria, so your application may yet be either rejected or you may have to go through further steps. It is a good idea to go through their requirements before you fill their form.

1\. The obvious requirement is that your Apple iPhone 12 Pro Max must be locked to AT&T, else you should go to the relevant carrier page.

2\. You iPhone couldn't have been reported as either lost or stolen.

3\. No record of it having been linked to any criminal or fraudulent activities.

4\. All termination fees have been paid in full, and all the other iPhone installment plans, etc, have been completed.

5\. After upgrading iPhone you must wait 14 days before you're eligible for unlock.

Finding out how to unlock AT&T iPhone can be harrowing if you don't know where to look, especially because performing the unlock can be so crucial for many people in order to access other carriers.

Both the options mentioned above offer a legitimate means by which you can AT&T unlock your Apple iPhone 12 Pro Max, whether done without a SIM card or by contacting the AT&T carrier.

However, going by personal experience the DoctorSIM alternative offers a much smoother, efficient and quicker alternative to contacting the AT&T carriers. It is also more secure because if you are going via the carrier without a SIM card then you'll need to back up your Apple iPhone 12 Pro Max, then delete and restore it as well (for security measures). This isn't just a time consuming process, but it can also prove to be risky. Furthermore, AT&T has a lot of checks and requisites in place which can keep your Apple iPhone 12 Pro Max from being unlocked, and even if you do pass the requisites it's still a time-consuming process which may still be rejected as AT&T has final say. As such, going via DoctorSIM gives you complete agency and conveniently AT&T unlocks iPhone without any data loss, through a simple 3 step process.

## What to do if your Apple iPhone 12 Pro Max has bad ESN or blacklisted IMEI?

Many people have iPhones but don’t know what an IMEI number is or what a bad ESN represents. Understanding how to tackle this issue can save time, money, and a headache or two. In this extensive guide, we’ll walk you through the basic mechanics of ESN and IMEI, how to check if your Apple iPhone 12 Pro Max is blacklisted, and the detailed steps for unlocking a phone with a bad ESN or blacklisted IMEI.

## Part 1: Basic information about IMEI number and ESN

### What is IMEI number?

IMEI (International Mobile Equipment Identity): IMEI numbers are unique to GSM (Global System for Mobile Communications) and UMTS (Universal Mobile Telecommunications System) network mobile phones. Unlike ESN, an IMEI number is 15 digits long. It serves as an anti-theft measure, meaning a blacklisted IMEI can result from a device being reported lost or stolen or a breach of the consumer agreement.

![iPhone imei number check](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/iphone-imei-check.jpg)

### What is an ESN?

Electronic Serial Number (ESN): Previously utilized by CDMA (Code Division Multiple Access) networks, an ESN was a unique identifier for cellular devices. With technological progression, most carriers have shifted their focus to the IMEI system, but knowing your ESN’s history is still crucial, especially if you're dealing with older devices.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### What is a Bad ESN?

A Bad ESN can mean a lot of things, let’s check out some examples:

1. If you hear this term most probably you are trying to activate the Apple iPhone 12 Pro Max device with a carrier, but that’s not possible due to some reasons.
2. It can mean that the previous owner of the Apple iPhone 12 Pro Max device switched carriers.
3. The previous owner had an outstanding amount on their bill and cancelled the account without paying the bill first.
4. The previous owner didn’t have a bill when they cancelled the account but they were still under a contract and if you cancel sooner than the due date for the contract, an "early termination fee" is created based on the remaining period of the contract and they hadn’t paid that amount.
5. The person that sold you the phone or someone else who was the actual owner of the Apple iPhone 12 Pro Max device reported the Apple iPhone 12 Pro Max device as lost or stolen.

### What is a blacklisted IMEI?

Blacklisted IMEI is basically the same thing as Bad ESN but for devices that work on CDMA networks, like Verizon or Sprint. In short, the main reason that a device has a Blacklisted IMEI is so that you as the owner or someone else cannot activate the Apple iPhone 12 Pro Max device on any carrier, not even the original one, thus avoiding selling or stealing the phone.

## Part 3: What to do if your Apple iPhone 12 Pro Max has bad ESN or blacklisted IMEI?

A bad ESN or blacklisted IMEI is serious business. It can result in a device being unusable on most of the surrounding networks. If your IMEI is blacklisted, there are steps for potential resolution:

### Ask the seller for a refund

For example, Amazon and eBay have refund policies. Unfortunately, if you got the phone from someone you found on the street, or from a seller over sources like Craigslist, this might not be possible. But there are still other things you can do.

### Swap the Logic Board

The thing about a blacklisted IMEI is that it’s only blacklisted in a particular country. An unlocked AT&T iPhone blacklisted in the US would still function in Australia on another network. As such you can try and change the chips of your Apple iPhone 12 Pro Max. However, in doing so you should be prepared for some possible irreparable damage.

### Unlock it and then Sell it

After your unlock your Apple iPhone 12 Pro Max you can sell it to foreigners at a lowered rate. You can find out how to unlock in the next steps. But why would foreigners buy a blacklisted phone, you might ask? That’s because they won’t be on US soil long, and the IMEI is only blacklisted locally. So foreigners and tourists might be persuaded to buy your Apple iPhone 12 Pro Max if you throw in a big enough discount.

![iPhone has bad esn](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/10-things-you-can-do-with-an-iphone-that-has-bad-esn-or-blacklisted-iemi-9.gif)

### Take it apart and sell the spare parts

### Sell internationally

As mentioned earlier, you can unlock the phone with the blacklisted IMEI. However, since it’s only blacklisted locally, you can sell it internationally where it would still have value.

![iPhone bad esn](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/10-things-you-can-do-with-an-iphone-that-has-bad-esn-or-blacklisted-iemi-11.jpg)

### Flash phone to another carrier

This is an ideal option for those who don’t mind changing carriers. You can flash the phone to another carrier, as long as they accept it, and pretty soon you’ll have a functional phone! However, in some cases, you might land with a 3G connection instead of a 4G.

### Determine Hybrid GSM/CDMA Phones

If your phone cannot activate on a CDMA carrier like Verizon or Sprint, the IMEI can still be used on a GSM network. Most phones manufactured these days come with a GSM standard nano or micro sim card slot and have GSM radio enabling for a GSM network. Most of them also come factory unlocked as well.

## Part 4: How to unlock a phone with bad ESN or blacklisted IMEI?

Unlocking a phone with bad ESN or a blacklisted IMEI is not a single-step process. It involves both technological and legal maneuvering. It's important to note that unlocking a blacklisted phone might not make it fully operational, but it can help in using it with carriers outside the country where it was blacklisted.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### Understanding Lock Status

Before proceeding, ensure you understand the lock status of your phone. If the phone is network locked, it only works with a specific carrier. If it is blacklisted, it’s barred from most network use. An unlocked phone, on the other hand, is a blank slate ready to work with any carrier that supports the Apple iPhone 12 Pro Max device's technological specifications.

### Steps to Unlock

Here's a comprehensive overview of the steps to unlock a phone with a bad ESN or blacklisted IMEI:

1. ****Ascertain Legality:**** Ensure unlocking your phone is within the bounds of the law, both locally and globally. Legal provisions such as the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) in the US and similar laws elsewhere define the circumstances under which phone unlocking is legal.
2. ****Contact the Carrier:**** If the blacklisting issue has been resolved, contacting the carrier who blacklisted the Apple iPhone 12 Pro Max device is the most straightforward way to unlock it. They may require clear documentation proving ownership of the Apple iPhone 12 Pro Max device and the resolution of the reason for blacklisting.
3. ****Consider Third-Party Services:**** If your phone was blacklisted from a carrier in a different country where unlocking might be a common practice, third-party services can assist. Verify that they are reputable and have a solid track record, as well as a range of positive reviews from previous customers.
4. ****IMEI Repair and Unlock Tools:**** Some advanced users may consider IMEI repair software or unlock tools. However, utilizing these services could be illegal or fraudulent unless you are a certified technician who can verify the legitimacy of the software being used and the legality of the method in your region.

![iphone imei check](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/iphone-imei-check.jpg)

#### **Q: I am the owner of the Apple iPhone 12 Pro Max and I reported it as lost some time ago and I found it, can I cancel it?**

Yes, you can but most carriers will ask you to go to a retail store with at least one valid ID.

#### **Q: I dropped My Apple iPhone 12 Pro Max and the screen cracked. Does it now have a bad ESN?**

Hardware damage has no relation with an ESN. So your ESN status will remain unchanged.

#### **Q: Is it Legal to Unlock a Phone with a Bad ESN or Blacklisted IMEI?**

The legality of unlocking a phone with a bad ESN or blacklisted IMEI varies from country to country and can be influenced by specific case laws. However, in cases where the user is the original owner and the phone is paid off, it's typically legal to unlock the Apple iPhone 12 Pro Max device.

#### **Q: Can You Use a Blacklisted Phone Internationally?**

In some cases, a blacklisted phone can be used internationally. When a phone is blacklisted, it's typically barred from the carrier network where the blacklist was applied. However, different countries have different national blacklists, so it's possible that a phone blacklisted in one country will work in another. Unlocking the phone internationally can be an option here.

#### **Q: Can IMEI Cleaning Really Work?**

IMEI cleaning is the process by which the IMEI's blacklisted status is removed. There are services that offer to clean your IMEI, and while some may work, it’s important to understand the legality and efficacy of such services, as it may involve fraudulent activity and your phone may still not be fully operational on some networks even after being cleaned.

#### **Q: What Consequences Can I Face by Using a Blacklisted Phone?**

Using a blacklisted phone can have various consequences. It's unlikely to work on the network of the carrier where it was blacklisted, and the reliability of third-party carriers might be limited. Additionally, there may be legal implications, especially if the phone was blacklisted for being reported lost or stolen.

#### **Q: Should I Buy a Phone with a Bad ESN or Blacklisted IMEI?**

It's generally not advisable to purchase a phone with a bad ESN or blacklisted IMEI, as it would be difficult to use on most networks. Such devices are often sold at lower prices, but the risks and limitations associated with them might not be worth the discount.
