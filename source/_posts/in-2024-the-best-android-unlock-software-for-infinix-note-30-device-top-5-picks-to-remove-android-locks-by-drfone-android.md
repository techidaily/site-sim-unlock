### 2\. Trycktill

Website URL: [http://www.trycktill.com/](http://www.trycktill.com/)

This one is more a website for mobile content but it can also generate free mobile unlocking codes. Click on "Unlock" on the top bar menu to begin. The site is in Swedish so may want to translate it before you can use it. You can do that by clicking on the British Flag at the bottom of the page.

Select your phone model from the drop down menu and then select the model number and enter the IMEI number. Finally, agree to the terms and conditions and then click "Generate Code."

In the results page you should see a code as well as instructions on how to use it to unlock the phone. The codes and instructions will differ slightly depending on the Infinix Note 30 device model.

This website unlocks LG, AEG, MAXON, Nokia, Panasonic, Vitel and Siemens devices.
