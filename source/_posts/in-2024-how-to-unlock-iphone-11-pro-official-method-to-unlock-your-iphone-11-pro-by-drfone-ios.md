### 1\. No Due Before Unlocking

When iPhone users sign contracts with a giant cell phone company for a certain amount of time, they often get a discount on a device. Because of this, the Apple iPhone 11 Pro device comes with a controller lock so customers can only use it on their network.

So, if you've paid off your contract or bought your Apple iPhone 11 Pro without a subsidy, it's perfectly legal to unlock it. But if you're still paying off your contract, you still need to own the Apple iPhone 11 Pro fully, so you should confirm with your carrier before unlocking it.

### 2\. You Should Buy It for More Than the Time Limit in the Contract

You can leave without paying anything if your agreement with the company is over. If you signed a contract in exchange for a lower price upfront, you would have to wait until your contract ended (usually 24 months) or pay the remaining balance if you bought your phone on a payment plan.

## 3 Free Ways to Unlock iPhone Offline

Following are some free ways to unlock your Apple iPhone 11 Pro Offline. You can unlock your Apple iPhone 11 Pro by making small changes in the settings of your Apple iPhone 11 Pro.

### Unlock iPhone SIM card via phone app

Call any number from the Phone app or contact to display the “SIM Locked” pop-up window and unlock your Apple iPhone 11 Pro. The SIM PIN entry window will pop up again, ready for you to type in your code. Enter any fake number instead of dialing a real number like “333” and press the green button.

### Unlock your Apple iPhone 11 Pro SIM card via "Settings"

The “Settings” app is another way to bring up the unlock notification. Go to the “Cellular” tab and choose “SIM PIN” as the last option. The SIM card should now ask you to unlock your Apple iPhone 11 Pro.

### Unlock it via IMEI code

Contacting your carrier to unlock the sim lock on your Apple iPhone 11 Pro is legit and straightway. But before contacting your carrier, you must fulfill the following conditions.

- The device must be legal, which means the Apple iPhone 11 Pro device has not been reported as lost, stolen, or connected to a crime.
- You shouldn't have any debts in your bank account.
- If you signed a contract in exchange for a lower upfront price, you would have to wait until your contract expires (typically 24 months) or pay the remaining amount if you purchased your phone on a payment plan.

If you meet the above conditions, you can get the phone unlocked from your carrier. You have to provide them IMEI number of your device. However, the rest of the unlocking process is different for each company.
