## How To Unlock Apple iPhone X: Official Method to Unlock Your Apple iPhone X

Restriction on the use of a SIM card by a carrier often creates a lot of problems. The barrier that you can't use another company's SIM somehow makes you feel like you're not the only owner of the phone. But you don't need to worry anymore because you are in the right place to know about the way use to unlock your Apple iPhone X.

This article is about the official way to get your Apple iPhone X unlocked from your carrier. But we also have a solution if you want to avoid contacting your carrier.

## Part 1: What Should You Do Before Apple iPhone X SIM Unlock?

Before unlocking your Apple iPhone X from the carrier, you should fulfill the following criteria.

### 1\. No Due Before Unlocking

When iPhone users sign contracts with a giant cell phone company for a certain amount of time, they often get a discount on a device. Because of this, the Apple iPhone X device comes with a controller lock so customers can only use it on their network.

So, if you've paid off your contract or bought your Apple iPhone X without a subsidy, it's perfectly legal to unlock it. But if you're still paying off your contract, you still need to own the Apple iPhone X fully, so you should confirm with your carrier before unlocking it.

### 2\. You Should Buy It for More Than the Time Limit in the Contract

You can leave without paying anything if your agreement with the company is over. If you signed a contract in exchange for a lower price upfront, you would have to wait until your contract ended (usually 24 months) or pay the remaining balance if you bought your phone on a payment plan.

### Examples: Requirements of Sim Unlock of T-Mobile/EE/AT&T

T-Mobile, EE, and AT&T have common requirements before you can unlock your Apple iPhone X.

- It has to be legal. It means the Apple iPhone X device has not been reported as lost, stolen, or linked to a crime.
- Your bank account shouldn't have any debts.
- If you signed a contract in exchange for a lower price upfront, you would have to wait until your contract was up (usually 24 months) or pay the remaining balance if you bought your phone on a payment plan.

Apart from the requirements mentioned above, each company has its way of unlocking.

**T-Mobile**

- If you meet the above requirements, you can call customer service at 611 from the Apple iPhone X device you want to unlock to unlock an iPhone 11 or 12 that is locked to a T-Mobile network.

#### **Step 3:** Restore

Finally, just restore all the information from the iCloud back up. This is also fairly simple. As you follow the system setup after erasing, you'll be taken to the 'Apps & Data' screen. Simply select 'Restore from iCloud Backup.'

With that your Apple iPhone X is now completely unlock activated! You're free to use it as you please now.

In this article we've explained how to unlock T Mobile Apple iPhone X using DoctorSIM - SIM Unlock Service, and how to unlock T Mobile iPhone 5s using the T Mobile carrier itself. While both of them are perfectly legitimate means of unlocking your Apple iPhone Xs, I personally lean more towards the DoctorSIM solution as they don't have any pesky eligibility criteria, nor do they make you wait long. They are a 100% solution, especially considering they're a third-party tool which makes them less biased as they don't have an incentive to keep you from unlocking. Well, we hope this helped and hopefully now you have a T Mobile unlock iPhone!

## How to Unlock Apple iPhone X with IMEI Code?

If you have a locked iPhone, we have different methods that entail how to unlock iPhone with IMEI code. Apart from this, we have two separate unlocking methods which usually confuse a good number of people. These methods are Sim Unlock and iCloud activation lock bypass. The difference between the two is that the Sim unlock method involves unlocking the sim lock while the iCloud activation revolves around unlocking the automatic iCloud activation security feature.  

If you want to know how to unlock iPhone with IMEI number and how to bypass iCloud lock, I have with me two different methods that will unlock your locked iPhone in a span of days as long as you follow the required steps.

## Part 1: What is IMEI code? How to find IMEI Code on iPhone?

Each and every phone comes with a unique 15-digit code that differentiates it from other devices. This unique code acts as determinant or a tracking number when you happen to lose your phone. For those with iPhones, you can retrieve this unique number in different ways. The following are some of them.

**1.1 Dial \*#06#**

This is the primary method of checking your IMEI code on almost all devices. On your dial pad, dial \*#06# and press the call icon. Your unique code will be displayed immediately.
