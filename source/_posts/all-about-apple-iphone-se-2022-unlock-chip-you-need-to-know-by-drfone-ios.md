### How does it work

An unlock chip is typically a slim SIM card, a memory interface chip that can be put in along with your regular SIM card. It goes on top of your Apple iPhone SE (2022)'s normal SIM card and removes the network lock so you can use any sim.

![iphone unlock chip](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/12/iphone-unlock-chip-4.jpg)

The factory lock is removed quickly when an unlock chip is put into your Apple iPhone SE (2022). An iPhone Unlock Chip fools your Apple iPhone SE (2022) into thinking it only uses a Cricket SIM card. The Apple iPhone SE (2022) Unlock Chip has the structure to fake the iPhone's IMEI number and the authentication key, which allows it to work with any GSM Service.

Putting an iPhone Unlock Chip around your regular SIM card changes how your Apple iPhone SE (2022) and SIM card talk to each other. So, the unlock chip's controller fakes the IMSI number, which allows you to use other mobile networks.

Unfortunately, many iPhone unlock chips require a jailbroken iPhone before being used. Even if your Apple iPhone SE (2022) isn't jailbroken, you can still use an iPhone unlock chip to access some of its features.

There are several places to find information about jailbreaking an iPhone. After selecting, you can program your Apple iPhone SE (2022)'s unlock chip by following the on-screen instructions.
