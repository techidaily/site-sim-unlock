## Ways To Find Unlocking Codes For Infinix Hot 40 Pro Phones

When you have a locked device, it is pretty much impossible to move from one network to another. This would cause problems if for instance you wanted to travel outside the country and want to switch to that country's carrier for the duration of your stay. Or maybe you just want to switch carriers because you don't like your current provider.

Whatever the reason, you should be able to unlock your device easily. But this has often proven difficult because of the fact that you need unlock codes. The problem is that many sites promise free unlocking codes for your device and many turn out to be fraudulent sites that use the word "free" in their advertising but actually require you to pay for the service. If you have been unsuccessfully searching for free unlocking codes for your device, look no further. This article compiles three of the best for Android and iPhone.

## Part 1: 3 Ways to Find Unlocking Codes for Android Devices

<iframe width="800" height="450" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/393YR8Hum5g" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0"></iframe>

It is very important to note that by unlocking your device you are breaching the contract you have with your service provider.

## Three Ways to Sim Unlock Infinix Hot 40 Pro

You probably purchased your Infinix Hot 40 Pro for a significant discount but are now stuck with the same network for a couple of years. You loved the Infinix Hot 40 Pro device but your network provider does not have any plans that exactly suit your needs. To release your device from your current network's clutches, you will need to unlock your phone.

There are three ways you can do it and this post will go through each method so that you can find one that you are most comfortable with. Do note that if your contract has ended with your network provider, this "How to unlock Infinix Hot 40 Pro" post can be skipped as you can just ask them to unlock your phone or purchase a [sim network unlock pin](https://drfone.wondershare.com/unlock/unlock-samsung-sim-network-unlock-pin.html) for a minimal price.

## Part 1: Infinix Hot 40 Pro Unlock Code

This is probably the easiest, no-fuss method to [sim unlock](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/unlock-android-screen/) Infinix Hot 40 Pro. Follow these steps carefully to successfully perform Infinix Hot 40 Pro unlock code.

Do take note that this process may not work with your carrier. Therefore, always check if this is the right way to obtain the necessary code:

- 1\. Check the SIM lock status---you can do this by dialing **\*#\*#7378423#\*#\***.

![sony xperia unlock code](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2016/08/14707989592943.jpg)

![unlock with sony xperia unlock code](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2016/08/14707989592897.jpg)

- 3\. The number beside **Network** indicates how many attempts you have to unlock the phone. If it says '7' it means you have seven attempts; '0' simply means it is hard locked and cannot be unlocked using this method.

![unlock code sony xperia](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2016/08/14707989597664.jpg)

- 4\. Find the **IMEI number** by dialing **\*#06#**. Jot it down as this will be your code.

![sony unlock code](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2016/08/14707998453087.jpg)

- 5\. Insert your new SIM card and tap in the IMEI number when it asks you for SIM network unlock PIN.

![sony unlock screen](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2016/08/unlock-screen.jpg)

## Part 2: The Best Infinix Hot 40 Pro SIM Unlock Code Generator

## Part 3: Infinix Hot 40 Pro Unlock Carrier

If your Infinix Hot 40 Pro is hard locked, this is your best bet in getting your device unlocked. Actually, it is the safest method among all three:

1. Get a new SIM card from a new carrier.
2. Call your carrier's customer service line and ask what are the requirements to qualify you to get your Infinix Hot 40 Pro unlocked. If you have honored your contract, there should not be any problems. However, do ask your carrier if there are any additional requirements. Do note that there may be fees involved.
3. Once your customer service representative has determined if you have met all their requirements, they should give you the SIM network unlock PIN Infinix Hot 40 Pro. Again, depending on your carrier, they might either give you the code over the phone, through email or via SMS.

## Part 6: The downside of an unlocked Infinix Hot 40 Pro

Are you thinking "Well, why can't I just buy an unlocked Infinix Hot 40 Pro in the first place?" right about now? Well, you can but think of the amount of money it will cost you.

For example, in Australia, an unlocked Infinix Hot 40 Pro will cost around $499 from any Infinix outlet but $0 for the Infinix Hot 40 Pro device when you pair it with a 24-month postpaid plan. While this may look attractive now, you may be paying more for a locked Infinix Hot 40 Pro in the long run.

## Conclusion

Now that you know the three ways of unlocking your Infinix Hot 40 Pro, all you need to do is find one that is most compatible with you. Just remember to think of everything through and carefully. Most importantly, if you have a locked device, always seek advice from your carrier to see if this is possible.
