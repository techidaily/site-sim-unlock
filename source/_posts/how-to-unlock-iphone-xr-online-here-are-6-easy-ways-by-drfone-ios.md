<a href="https://propmoneyinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/1803116/14559" target="_top" id="1803116"><img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/14559-1803116" border="0" alt="" width="859" height="859"/></a><img height="0" width="0" src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1803116/14559" style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0" />

### 1\. No Due Before Unlocking

When iPhone users sign contracts with a giant cell phone company for a certain amount of time, they often get a discount on a device. Because of this, the Apple iPhone XR device comes with a controller lock so customers can only use it on their network.

So, if you've paid off your contract or bought your Apple iPhone XR without a subsidy, it's perfectly legal to unlock it. But if you're still paying off your contract, you still need to own the Apple iPhone XR fully, so you should confirm with your carrier before unlocking it.

### 2\. You Should Buy It for More Than the Time Limit in the Contract

You can leave without paying anything if your agreement with the company is over. If you signed a contract in exchange for a lower price upfront, you would have to wait until your contract ended (usually 24 months) or pay the remaining balance if you bought your phone on a payment plan.

## Part 1: Defining ICCID Code and Its Need

At the heart of every iPhone's connectivity lies the ICCID code. It is an acronym for Integrated Circuit Card Identifier. This unique numerical sequence is more than a string of digits. It serves as a crucial identifier for your SIM card. Every ICCID code is exclusive to a specific SIM card, like each person has a distinct fingerprint. This enables mobile carriers and networks to recognize and authenticate the Apple iPhone XR device.

The ICCID code is essential for your Apple iPhone XR to connect smoothly to cellular networks. When you put a SIM card in your Apple iPhone XR, the Apple iPhone XR device reads the ICCID code. This code helps identify the carrier, subscription details, and network services.

All this info is crucial for your Apple iPhone XR to access voice, messaging, and data services. The ICCID code is essential for unlocking your Apple iPhone XR. An **ICCID iPhone unlock** allows you to use it with different carriers and enjoy a broader range of network options.

## Part 2: How To Find The ICCID Code Or Get a New One

There are two primary methods you can use to find the ICCID code. You can find it through your Apple iPhone XR's settings or directly from the SIM card itself. When it comes to finding **ICCID unlock code**, there are many online options available. First things first, let's go through the methods of finding your SIM card's ICCID code:

### Method 1: Through iPhone "Settings"

To easily find your SIM card's essential ICCID code, you can use the Apple iPhone XR device's settings.

- **Step 3:** Open the slot for your SIM card, remove the SIM card, and insert the GPP activation chip in its place. Now, put the SIM card above the chip and put it back into your Apple iPhone XR. After securing the new SIM card, connect your Apple iPhone XR to a Wi-Fi network.
