## Ways To Find Unlocking Codes For Itel S23 Phones

When you have a locked device, it is pretty much impossible to move from one network to another. This would cause problems if for instance you wanted to travel outside the country and want to switch to that country's carrier for the duration of your stay. Or maybe you just want to switch carriers because you don't like your current provider.

Whatever the reason, you should be able to unlock your device easily. But this has often proven difficult because of the fact that you need unlock codes. The problem is that many sites promise free unlocking codes for your device and many turn out to be fraudulent sites that use the word "free" in their advertising but actually require you to pay for the service. If you have been unsuccessfully searching for free unlocking codes for your device, look no further. This article compiles three of the best for Android and iPhone.

## Part 3: Popular Youtube Video for Unlocking Your Itel S23

Here we've found a popular video on Youtube for you to follow and sim unlock your phone.

<iframe width="800" height="450" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/393YR8Hum5g" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0"></iframe>

It is very important to note that by unlocking your device you are breaching the contract you have with your service provider. Also, note that if the codes fail to work the first 4 times don't try to enter a fifth time as this will generally disable your device. This will mean that you will be unable to use the Itel S23 device. Proceed with caution.
