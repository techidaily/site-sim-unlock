## Three Ways to Sim Unlock Oppo Find X6 Pro

You probably purchased your Oppo Find X6 Pro for a significant discount but are now stuck with the same network for a couple of years. You loved the Oppo Find X6 Pro device but your network provider does not have any plans that exactly suit your needs. To release your device from your current network's clutches, you will need to unlock your phone.

There are three ways you can do it and this post will go through each method so that you can find one that you are most comfortable with. Do note that if your contract has ended with your network provider, this "How to unlock Oppo Find X6 Pro" post can be skipped as you can just ask them to unlock your phone or purchase a [sim network unlock pin](https://drfone.wondershare.com/unlock/unlock-samsung-sim-network-unlock-pin.html) for a minimal price.

## Part 1: Oppo Find X6 Pro Unlock Code

This is probably the easiest, no-fuss method to [sim unlock](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/unlock-android-screen/) Oppo Find X6 Pro. Follow these steps carefully to successfully perform Oppo Find X6 Pro unlock code.

Do take note that this process may not work with your carrier. Therefore, always check if this is the right way to obtain the necessary code:

- 1\. Check the SIM lock status---you can do this by dialing **\*#\*#7378423#\*#\***.

![sony xperia unlock code](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2016/08/14707989592943.jpg)

- 2\. Tap **Service info** then **Sim lock**.

![unlock with sony xperia unlock code](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2016/08/14707989592897.jpg)

- 3\. The number beside **Network** indicates how many attempts you have to unlock the phone. If it says '7' it means you have seven attempts; '0' simply means it is hard locked and cannot be unlocked using this method.

![unlock code sony xperia](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2016/08/14707989597664.jpg)

- 4\. Find the **IMEI number** by dialing **\*#06#**. Jot it down as this will be your code.

![sony unlock code](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2016/08/14707998453087.jpg)

- 5\. Insert your new SIM card and tap in the IMEI number when it asks you for SIM network unlock PIN.

![sony unlock screen](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2016/08/unlock-screen.jpg)

If you have followed these steps to a tee, you should have unlocked your device. If you had to abort after Step 2, look at the other two methods below.

## Part 2: The Best Oppo Find X6 Pro SIM Unlock Code Generator

To safely and successfully sim unlock your Oppo Find X6 Pro, it is important to find a trustworthy [sim network unlock pin software](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/unlock-android-screen/). Here I am going you present to you DoctorSIM - SIM Unlock Service. It definitely is one of the best sim unlocking code generators in the market. It helps you permanently sim unlock your phone so you can use it on any carrier provider you want in the world.

### How to use SIM Unlock Service

Step 1. Visit Doctor - SIM Unlock Service official website, click on the Select Your Oppo Find X6 Pro button, and then select Oppo among all the phone brands.

Step 2. On the new window, fill in your phone IMEI number, model, your contact email, and other required information. Once your order is processed, the system will then send you the unlock code and instructions. You can follow the instruction to unlock your phone easily.

## Part 3: Oppo Find X6 Pro Unlock Carrier

If your Oppo Find X6 Pro is hard locked, this is your best bet in getting your device unlocked. Actually, it is the safest method among all three:

1. Get a new SIM card from a new carrier.
2. Call your carrier's customer service line and ask what are the requirements to qualify you to get your Oppo Find X6 Pro unlocked. If you have honored your contract, there should not be any problems. However, do ask your carrier if there are any additional requirements. Do note that there may be fees involved.
3. Once your customer service representative has determined if you have met all their requirements, they should give you the SIM network unlock PIN Oppo Find X6 Pro. Again, depending on your carrier, they might either give you the code over the phone, through email or via SMS. If you have the choice, always opt for email or SMS so that you are able to jot down the right number.
4. Once you have gotten the code, insert the new SIM card (from your new carrier). You will receive a prompt to enter your code. Make sure that you key in the right code---entering the wrong code will cause your phone to be locked (possibly forever).

## Part 4: Oppo Find X6 Pro Unlock App/Software

There are some of us out there who are just not confident with doing things ourselves or trusting our own carrier.

HOWEVER, if your first instinct is to head to Google Play to look for SIM unlock tools, heed these cautions. There are currently many apps that claim that they can unlock your phone but it is just a scam. You should also avoid torrent files available online.

## Part 5: The benefits of an unlocked Oppo Find X6 Pro

If you now know how to unlock Oppo Find X6 Pro but still do not know its advantages, we are here to help.

As indicated in the introduction, unlocked phone users can freely choose the plans they subscribed to---on any carriers, in any country. Therefore, if you travel frequently around the world, having an unlocked Oppo Find X6 Pro would be beneficial. Using a local SIM card is much cheaper than paying for exorbitant roaming charges.

You can also benefit from an unlocked Oppo Find X6 Pro if you are the kind of person who likes to take advantage of current offers provided by your local carriers. Prepaid plans are always changing in terms of offering so having the flexibility of changing carriers and prepaid plans can help you save money in the long run.

## Part 6: The downside of an unlocked Oppo Find X6 Pro

Are you thinking "Well, why can't I just buy an unlocked Oppo Find X6 Pro in the first place?" right about now? Well, you can but think of the amount of money it will cost you.

For example, in Australia, an unlocked Oppo Find X6 Pro will cost around $499 from any Oppo outlet but $0 for the Oppo Find X6 Pro device when you pair it with a 24-month postpaid plan. While this may look attractive now, you may be paying more for a locked Oppo Find X6 Pro in the long run.

## Conclusion

Now that you know the three ways of unlocking your Oppo Find X6 Pro, all you need to do is find one that is most compatible with you. Just remember to think of everything through and carefully. Most importantly, if you have a locked device, always seek advice from your carrier to see if this is possible.

## How To Check if Your Oppo Find X6 Pro Is Unlocked

This can limit your options down the line. Knowing if your phone is unlocked becomes crucial, especially when planning an international trip, seeking better deals, or simply wanting the flexibility to switch carriers.

Thankfully, this guide will equip you with the knowledge and tools to learn **how to check if your phone is unlocked**. You’ll even know how to unlock it yourself if you see it’s locked. So, dive in and unlock your phone’s full potential with all the abilities this article can teach you.

### How To Check if Your iPhone Is Unlocked

For iPhone users, navigating the unlock status involves a quick trip to your device settings:

- **Step 1:**Open your iPhone’s Settings app.
- **Step 2:** Navigate to **General** in Settings, then tap **About**.
- **Step 3:** Scroll down and check for **Carrier Lock** or **Service Provider Lock**. If it says **No SIM Restrictions**, your phone is unlocked. It’s easy to learn **how to tell if a phone is unlocked** when using an iPhone.

Android devices, with their diverse manufacturers and UI variations, require a slightly different approach:

- **Step 1:** Open the Settings app on your Android phone.
- **Step 2:** Explore options related to “Network” or “Mobile Network.” The specific path might vary depending on your device’s brand and model.
- **Step 3:** Look for options like “Network Operators,” “SIM Card Lock,” or similar. If you can search for available networks, your phone is likely unlocked. This is one of the prime ways **how to check if a phone is an unlocked** on Android devices.

![android network unlock settings](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/02/check-if-phone-unlocked-03.jpg)

**Note:** Some manufacturers offer dedicated tools or apps to check unlock status. Consult your device’s manual or website for specific instructions.

### Carrier-Specific Solutions: Unlocking the Details

While the above methods provide general guidance, certain carriers might offer dedicated methods to verify the unlock status. For example, Verizon offers two ways to answer your question, “**how do I know if my Verizon phone is unlocked**?”

- **Contract check.**Review your Verizon contract to see if the unlock eligibility date has passed since the contract’s execution.
- **Unlocking process.**Visit the Verizon website and initiate the unlocking process. If successful, you’ll receive confirmation of your phone’s unlocked status.

**Note:** The process for other carriers is usually similar. Check their respective websites or contact their customer support for specific details. Asking the carrier is also a great way **how to check if a phone is unlocked.**

Unlocking your phone might have restrictions depending on your carrier and contract. Always check their policies and procedures before proceeding.

## Part 2: How To Unlock Your Device After You Checked and It’s Locked

So, say you’ve found out your phone is still network-locked upon following the steps above. This might lead to frustration, especially if you want to put in a fresh SIM card. Thankfully, there are different ways to unlock your device when it’s still carrier-locked.

## How to Unlock SIM Card on Oppo Find X6 Pro online without jailbreak

Isn't it so frustrating when you try to change your SIM or your network, but just can't because your phone is locked under contract? Phones are our life source in this global age, it's our tether to reality, to the world! But if you have a carrier locked phone, then that connection is basically under contract by an external agency! You can't change your networks, there are limitations on how you use your phone, and when you have to travel abroad you have no option other than paying the roaming charges. If you, say, have an iPhone 5c and have these frustrations, it's likely you're already wondering how to unlock the iPhone 5c.

Chances are that if you've had a carrier locked phone for a while, you might have already forgotten what cellular freedom feels like. But we're here to remind you. All you have to do is break that carrier-lock, and you're good to go. However, you should be careful when doing so, cause if you try using a jailbreaking technique, it could have major repercussions. So we're here to give you some valuable advice about how to unlock iPhone 5, iPhone 5c, or even Android phones.

## Part 1: Unlock SIM Card on Oppo Find X6 Pro via jailbreak

Before we get into telling you how to unlock iPhone 5, or the SIM Card on iPhone or Android, we should first tell you what Jailbreaking is. You might have heard of this term before, and I'm sure it sounded ominous to you. Jailbreak? It sounds awfully close to 'Prison break.' Well, considering the carrier lock is sort of like a prison for your cell, it is an accurate terminology. But Jailbreak isn't just about breaking the carrier lock. That might happen as a by-product, but the real purpose is to break free of the software restrictions which are generally applied to Apple devices. This might seem like a good option because, well, who doesn't want to break free of all of Apple's restrictions? But that always comes at several heavy risks.

### Threats of unlocking SIM via Jailbreak

#### 1\. Not Permanent

This has got to be one of the biggest reasons for not jailbreaking your phone. It is not at all permanent! In fact, the moment you update your system, your jailbreak is lost and if you've started using a different SIM it will no longer function, and you're gonna have to go back to using that Carrier you tried so hard to escape from! It's really not worth the effort. Of course, you could stop updating altogether, but then that will bring us to…

![Unlock SIM Card on iPhone and Android via jailbreak](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2016/10/14771444107532.jpg)

#### 2\. Risky

If you don't update your iOS, or Mac or iPad or any device at all, in this day and age, you're basically just asking to be hacked. That is not to excuse those who do the hacking and plant malware on your system, but if you leave your front door open in a shitty neighborhood, well then you only have yourself to blame once you get robbed!

#### 3\. Warranty

Jailbreaking has now become kind-of-legal, in a very tenuous sense, but that doesn't mean Apple wholeheartedly welcomes jailbreaking. If you do so, you will never again be able to avail of the warranty on your phone. And with the kind of major bucks you have to shell out for those iPhones, you best keep that warranty intact.

#### 4\. Lack of Apps

Many top-notch and crucial app companies and organizations simply refuse to make their applications usable in jailbreak phones, as they are extremely risky and prone to hacking. As a result, you would have to rely on a bunch of non-professional apps made by amateurs, which is more likely to put your phone in harm's way.

#### 5\. Bricking

This basically means your whole system may crash and stop functioning. As a result, you're gonna' have to restore the whole thing and try to salvage whatever information you can. Now those who do jailbreak regularly will give you all kinds of excuses like it happens only rarely or that you can retrieve your data simply from the cloud, et al. But do you really want to divest all your time and energy trying to fight off malware, backing up all your data, etc, especially when there is a much more convenient option just around the corner?

Didn't think so.
