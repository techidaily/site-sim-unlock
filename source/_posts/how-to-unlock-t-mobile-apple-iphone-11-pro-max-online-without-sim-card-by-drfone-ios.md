## Part 3: How to unlock T Mobile iPhone via T Mobile carrier

If you want to unlock, say for example, a T Mobile iPhone 5s without a third-party tool, but by contacting the carrier directly, you can do that as well though that process would have a lot more restrictions and take a lot longer. Requesting carriers to T Mobile unlock iPhone 5s is becoming more and more of an outdated concept in the face of far easier third-party softwares. However, contacting the carriers directly is also a legitimate means. So read on to find out how to unlock T Mobile iPhone 5s via T Mobile carrier.

### How to unlock T Mobile iPhone 5s via T Mobile carrier

#### **Step 1:** Eligibility

## How Do I SIM Unlock My Apple iPhone 11 Pro Max?

If your Apple iPhone 11 Pro Max is locked to a particular carrier, it can be very frustrating. This is because your device will only be able to work with a SIM card from that provider and no other. This can be a problem when you want to change carriers. Some iPhones are generally easier to unlock than others, and the easiest way to unlock any iPhone is usually to use a paid online service. The issue is that these services can be very expensive.

In this article, we are going to look at how you can [sim unlock](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/unlock-android-screen/) your Apple iPhone 11 Pro Max. It is however important to note that if you purchased your device in the last one year, it is already unlocked.

Many people may wonder whether it is legal to unlock the iPhone. Actually, it is perfectly legal to unlock your Apple iPhone 11 Pro Max if you have completed payments on the contract, or you bought the Apple iPhone 11 Pro Max device outright. If however, you are still in the process of paying for your contract, you don't fully own the phone and so you should contact the carrier before unlocking it.

But if your Apple iPhone 11 Pro Max has [bad ESN](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/iphone-unlock/) or been blacklisted by the carrier, you can check the new post here to check what to do if you have a [blacklisted iPhone](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/iphone-unlock/).

##  Part 1: How to SIM Unlock Your Apple iPhone 11 Pro Max?

There are several ways to unlock your device. Let's look at a few of them.

### 1\. Contact your Carrier and Have them unlock the Apple iPhone 11 Pro Max device for you

This is probably the safest way to do it. If you have already completed payments on your Apple iPhone 11 Pro Max or you bought it outright, you can ask your carrier for the [sim network unlock pin](https://drfone.wondershare.com/unlock/unlock-samsung-sim-network-unlock-pin.html) to unlock your device. Depending on your carrier, you may have to pay for this service, and it also does take up to 7 days, sometimes more for them to get back to you.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### 2\. Software Unlocking

This is where you download a piece of [sim network unlock pin software](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/unlock-android-screen/) on to your device. This software makes changes to the Apple iPhone 11 Pro Max device, allowing you to make calls from any carrier. While this may sound straight-forward and easy, except it is highly risky and will not work for iPhone 4 and later models.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### 3\. Hardware Unlocking

This is where you alter the hardware of the Apple iPhone 11 Pro Max device to create an alternate path to deliver calls. Although this can be done, it also alters your device irreparably and probably also voids your warranty. Not to mention, you may pay more than $200 to have the Apple iPhone 11 Pro Max device unlocked in this way.

### 4\. IMEI unlocking

This is the best way to unlock your device and by far the easiest. This method uses your device's IMEI number to access the IMEI database and change the status of the Apple iPhone 11 Pro Max from locked to unlocked. There are very many services that you can use to IMEI unlock your device, and most of them will offer the service for a fee. But this is a great solution because there is no software to download, and you don't mess with the hardware in any way.

### Steps on How to Unlock Your Apple iPhone 11 Pro Max via IMEI

Like we mentioned before, there are a lot of services you can use to unlock your Apple iPhone 11 Pro Max. One of the best is [iPhoneIMEI.net](https://appleiphoneunlock.uk/network/Special%20Services/Activation%20Lock?aff=wondershare). This website helps you unlock the Apple iPhone 11 Pro Max in an official way, and it promises that the unlocked iPhone will not be relooked again. In this tutorial, we are going to use this website to show you how easy it is to unlock your Apple iPhone 11 Pro Max using your IMEI number.

Step 1: On your browser, navigate to [iPhoneIMEI.net](https://appleiphoneunlock.uk/network/Special%20Services/Activation%20Lock?aff=wondershare) from the home page. Select your Apple iPhone 11 Pro Max model and the network provider the phone is locked to. Then click on Unlock.

![sim unlock iphone with iphoneimei.net](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/03/apple-iphone-unlock.png)

Step 2: Next, you will be required to enter your IMEI number and get details of the price and how long it will take for the code to be generated. Click on “Unlock Now” and you will be sent to a payment page where you can complete the payment.

Step 3. After the payment is successful, the system will send your Apple iPhone 11 Pro Max IMEI to the network provider and whitelist it from Apple activation database (You will be received an email for this change). This step may take 1–5 days.

After the phone is successfully unlocked, you will get email notification too. When you see that email, just simply connect your Apple iPhone 11 Pro Max to a Wi-Fi network and insert any SIM card, your Apple iPhone 11 Pro Max should work instantly!

## Part 2: The Best SIM Unlock Service - Dr.Fone

A SIM unlock PIN is an effective way to remove your SIM lock effectively. However, it may not work sometimes.

For instance, some network providers require only the original owner of the phone can get the code. So, if you have a second-hand contract iPhone, you can't find the unlock PIN. If your Apple iPhone 11 Pro Max is X/8(Plus)/7(Plus)/SE/6S(Plus)/6(Plus)/5S, luckily, I will introduce an amazing software to help unlock your SIM card permanently. That is [Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock (iOS)](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/iphone-unlock/).

### Method 1: Contact your carrier for unlock code

When a customer signs a contract with a big cell phone company for a certain amount of time, they often get a discount on a device. Because of this, the Apple iPhone 11 Pro Max device comes with a controller lock so customers can only use it on their network.

You can leave without paying anything if your agreement with the company is over. You must meet the following requirements before you can unlock your Apple iPhone 11 Pro Max:

![sim unlock pin](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/12/how-to-unlock-iphone-11-12-4.jpg)

- First, the Apple iPhone 11 Pro Max device must be legal. It means the Apple iPhone 11 Pro Max device has not been reported as lost, stolen, or connected to a crime.
- Then you shouldn't have any debts in your bank account.
- If you signed a contract in exchange for a lower price upfront, you would have to wait until your contract ended (usually 24 months) or pay the remaining balance if you bought your phone on a payment plan.

Note: the unlocking process is different for each company.

**How to unlock the Apple iPhone 11 Pro Max locked by AT&T**

First, you need to know that AT&T limits how many devices a customer can unlock in a given year. Customers can unlock up to five devices per year if their account is in great condition. Visit the AT&T support page for more information about how to unlock an AT&T device and if you meet the requirements.

**AT&T Unlocking security question**

- The full name of the person whose name is on the account
- Last four digits of the account holder's social security number
- AT&T passcode of the registered account owner if they have an online account.
- The IMEI number of the Apple iPhone 11 Pro Max is 11/12. The serial number of the Apple iPhone 11 Pro Max device is called the IMEI number. You can find it on the original packaging, under the battery, and on the back of some models, by dialing #06 or navigating to Settings > General > About.

**How to unlock the Apple iPhone 11 Pro Max locked by T-Mobile**

T-Mobile has set several standards that should be matched to complete an unlock request.

- The device must be completely paid off, and the account must be in great condition.
- In the past 12 months, less than two SIM unlock codes for each line have been asked for.
- The device had used the T-Mobile network for at least 40 days before it was asked to be unlocked.
- If you have a service contract and have made a payment for at least 18 consecutive months, or if you paid a relocation fee. There are a few special cases that Customer Service can explain in more detail if required.
- The phone must have at least $50 worth of recharges paid for on prepaid plans.
- If you meet the above prerequisites, you can unlock an Apple iPhone 11 Pro Max carrier locked by a T-Mobile device by calling customer service at 611 from the Apple iPhone 11 Pro Max device you want to unlock.
- Make sure you have ALL of the following information on tips when you call:

1. The main account holder's phone number
2. Account Password
3. Account holder's SSN's last four digits
4. IMEI number. You can find this by navigating Settings > General > About or dialing \*#06#.

### Method 2: Some SIM-unlock websites

Following are some popular SIM-Unlock websites you can consider to unlock your Apple iPhone 11 Pro Max.

**AppleiPhoneUnlock**

This website says that it can help you unlock your Apple iPhone 11 Pro Max or iPad. Please prepare your IMEI code and confirm the Apple iPhone 11 Pro Max device model. But when we did some research, I found that this website has some bad customer reviews. So, if you consider using them to unlock your Apple iPhone 11 Pro Max, you should be more careful in checking the availability.

### Method 3: Try a SIM-unlock chip

iPhone unlock chips allow iPhones to run on any network globally. Unlocking an iPhone with this option is a cheap and very easy way. The Apple iPhone 11 Pro Max unlock chip allows a locked Apple iPhone 11 Pro Max to call and text using the local network sim card like a factory-unlocked phone. Unlock chip is a small SIM card that can be used along with regular SIM cards.

However, these Sim-unlock chips have some drawbacks. It reduces the Battery life and may cause SIM card slot and SIM card issues.
