## 3 Free Ways to Unlock iPhone Offline

Following are some free ways to unlock your Apple iPhone 11 Offline. You can unlock your Apple iPhone 11 by making small changes in the settings of your Apple iPhone 11.

### Unlock iPhone SIM card via phone app

Call any number from the Phone app or contact to display the “SIM Locked” pop-up window and unlock your Apple iPhone 11. The SIM PIN entry window will pop up again, ready for you to type in your code. Enter any fake number instead of dialing a real number like “333” and press the green button.

### Unlock it via IMEI code

Contacting your carrier to unlock the sim lock on your Apple iPhone 11 is legit and straightway. But before contacting your carrier, you must fulfill the following conditions.

- The device must be legal, which means the Apple iPhone 11 device has not been reported as lost, stolen, or connected to a crime.
- You shouldn't have any debts in your bank account.
- If you signed a contract in exchange for a lower upfront price, you would have to wait until your contract expires (typically 24 months) or pay the remaining amount if you purchased your phone on a payment plan.

If you meet the above conditions, you can get the phone unlocked from your carrier. You have to provide them IMEI number of your device. However, the rest of the unlocking process is different for each company.

### Contact the carrier for the unlock code

Large cell phone companies often offer discounted devices to customers who sign an agreement for set time frames. Because of this, the Apple iPhone 11 device comes with a controller lock so customers can only use it on their network. If your contract with the company is over, you can get out of it for free. Before you can unlock your Apple iPhone 11, you must meet the following requirements:

First of all, it must be a legal device. It means the Apple iPhone 11 device is not reported as lost, stolen. Then your bank account must not have any financial debts. If you signed a contract in exchange for a lower up-front cost, you'd have to wait until your contract ends (usually 24 months) or pay the remaining balance if you purchased your phone on a payment schedule.

Most carriers need active accounts for specific days before unlocking devices. Sprint has 50 days, T-Mobile 40, and AT&T 60. Verizon has no minimum period if you need to factory reset your phone to use the new network and back up beforehand.

### Insert a new SIM card to unlock your device

If you have a non-carrier SIM card, complete iPhone unlocking using these steps:

- Turn off your device.
- SIM card out.
- Insert the new SIM. Your device will be activated.
