## Part 3: How to unlock T Mobile iPhone via T Mobile carrier

### How to unlock T Mobile iPhone 5s via T Mobile carrier

So you've gone through whichever process most suited you and now you've even entered the T Mobile iPhone unlock code. But now you're left wondering, well now what? What's next? Well, what's next is that you make use of your new-found freedom, to break your phone in by using a different SIM, using one of these scenarios!

### I have SIM with a different Network Provider

In this case just follow the following steps:

1\. Remove old SIM Card.

2\. Enter new SIM Card.

3\. Restart iPhone.

### I don't have another SIM

In this case the process is a little longer. Do the following to activate the unlock:

#### **Step 1:** Back Up

You can back up easily with iCloud. It is a very simple solution. Simply go to settings on your Apple iPhone 7, followed by 'iCloud', then tap 'Back up now.'

![unlock t mobile iphone-backup iphone](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14772493104899.jpg) ![unlock t mobile iphone-back up iphone](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14772493145526.jpg)

![unlock t mobile iphone-erase iphone](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14772495041479.jpg)

#### **Step 3:** Restore

Finally, just restore all the information from the iCloud back up. This is also fairly simple. As you follow the system setup after erasing, you'll be taken to the 'Apps & Data' screen. Simply select 'Restore from iCloud Backup.'

![unlock t mobile iphone-restore iphone](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14772497801720.jpg)

With that your Apple iPhone 7 is now completely unlock activated! You're free to use it as you please now.

In this article we've explained how to unlock T Mobile Apple iPhone 7 using DoctorSIM - SIM Unlock Service, and how to unlock T Mobile iPhone 5s using the T Mobile carrier itself. While both of them are perfectly legitimate means of unlocking your Apple iPhone 7s, I personally lean more towards the DoctorSIM solution as they don't have any pesky eligibility criteria, nor do they make you wait long. They are a 100% solution, especially considering they're a third-party tool which makes them less biased as they don't have an incentive to keep you from unlocking. Well, we hope this helped and hopefully now you have a T Mobile unlock iPhone!
