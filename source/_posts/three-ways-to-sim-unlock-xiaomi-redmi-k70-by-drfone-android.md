To release your device from your current network's clutches, you will need to unlock your phone.

There are three ways you can do it and this post will go through each method so that you can find one that you are most comfortable with. Do note that if your contract has ended with your network provider, this "How to unlock Xiaomi Redmi K70" post can be skipped as you can just ask them to unlock your phone or purchase a [sim network unlock pin](https://drfone.wondershare.com/unlock/unlock-samsung-sim-network-unlock-pin.html) for a minimal price.

## Part 2: The Best Xiaomi Redmi K70 SIM Unlock Code Generator

To safely and successfully sim unlock your Xiaomi Redmi K70, it is important to find a trustworthy [sim network unlock pin software](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/unlock-android-screen/). Here I am going you present to you DoctorSIM - SIM Unlock Service. It definitely is one of the best sim unlocking code generators in the market. It helps you permanently sim unlock your phone so you can use it on any carrier provider you want in the world.

### How to use SIM Unlock Service

Step 1. Visit Doctor - SIM Unlock Service official website, click on the Select Your Xiaomi Redmi K70 button, and then select Xiaomi among all the phone brands.

Step 2. On the new window, fill in your phone IMEI number, model, your contact email, and other required information. Once your order is processed, the system will then send you the unlock code and instructions. You can follow the instruction to unlock your phone easily.

## Part 3: Xiaomi Redmi K70 Unlock Carrier

If your Xiaomi Redmi K70 is hard locked, this is your best bet in getting your device unlocked. Actually, it is the safest method among all three:

1. Get a new SIM card from a new carrier.
2. Call your carrier's customer service line and ask what are the requirements to qualify you to get your Xiaomi Redmi K70 unlocked. If you have honored your contract, there should not be any problems. However, do ask your carrier if there are any additional requirements. Do note that there may be fees involved.
3. Once your customer service representative has determined if you have met all their requirements, they should give you the SIM network unlock PIN Xiaomi Redmi K70. Again, depending on your carrier, they might either give you the code over the phone, through email or via SMS. If you have the choice, always opt for email or SMS so that you are able to jot down the right number.
4. Once you have gotten the code, insert the new SIM card (from your new carrier). You will receive a prompt to enter your code. Make sure that you key in the right code---entering the wrong code will cause your phone to be locked (possibly forever).

## Part 6: The downside of an unlocked Xiaomi Redmi K70

Are you thinking "Well, why can't I just buy an unlocked Xiaomi Redmi K70 in the first place?" right about now? Well, you can but think of the amount of money it will cost you.

For example, in Australia, an unlocked Xiaomi Redmi K70 will cost around $499 from any Xiaomi outlet but $0 for the Xiaomi Redmi K70 device when you pair it with a 24-month postpaid plan. While this may look attractive now, you may be paying more for a locked Xiaomi Redmi K70 in the long run.

## Conclusion

Now that you know the three ways of unlocking your Xiaomi Redmi K70, all you need to do is find one that is most compatible with you. Just remember to think of everything through and carefully. Most importantly, if you have a locked device, always seek advice from your carrier to see if this is possible.

It is really irritating when you realize that Xiaomi Redmi K70 phone is locked to a specific network. When you travel to another country, your phone becomes useless – you can’t use a foreign sim card. If your Xiaomi Redmi K70 phone is locked to a network and want to switch to a different provider, you are out of luck.

Thankfully, there are a few easy ways to unlock your Xiaomi Redmi K70 phone with free Xiaomi unlock codes. In this article, we review and explain 4 different websites that offer free unlock codes for Xiaomi Redmi K70 phones. Read ahead and learn how you can use four Xiaomi unlock code websites.

## Part 1: SIM Unlock Service

SIM Unlock Service is one of the best and trust-worthy SIM unlock code generators available on the market. This is not a free option, but it is so effective that many users find it is worth the price. It saves you so much hassle that it is worth the small upfront fee. Doctorsim will permanently unlock your phone, enabling you to use your phone on all carriers around the world. Most importantly, using DoctorSim will not void your warranty.

### How to use DoctorSim SIM Unlock Service to unlock Xiaomi Redmi K70 phones?

Step 1. Go to [DoctorSim's official website](https://www.doctorsim.com/libtrkafl.html?pc=43d47c30d945bcbd7d9527f4049f649a&refe=https://www.doctorsim.com/us-en/?scp&euro), so you know that you can trust it. Click on the ‘Select Your Xiaomi Redmi K70’ button, and then select Xiaomi from the list of brands.

Step 2. Fill in your phone’s information and your contact details in the following window, including the phone IMEI, phone model, and your email. Once your order is processed, the system will send you your personalized unlock code and unlocking instructions. You can then follow the instructions to unlock your Xiaomi Redmi K70 phone. Easy!

## Part 2: Unlockitfree.com for free Xiaomi unlock codes

Unlockitfree.com is a free remote unlock service, providing unlocking codes for Xiaomi Redmi K70 phones and other models. They offer a fast and free service, but it is not always reliable.

### How to use the Unlockitfree.com Unlock Service?

1\. First, enter your phone’s unique IMEI into the site, and then the site checks to ensure that it is genuine.

2\. Choose your phone model from the list provided, and then choose your country. Once you choose your country, a list of supported Service Providers will pop up. Choose your service provider, read the terms and conditions and accept. At this point, click Generate.

3\. The Unlockitfree Generator will show you a series of 7 different unlocking codes. Not all of these will work; usually the best options are the 1st and 7th code on the list.

4\. Without removing your SIM card, input these codes into your phone’s Home screen.

Hopefully you will have success – although, this is not guaranteed (as it is with the first Dr.Fone option above).

## Part 3: FreeUnlocks for free unlock codes for Xiaomi

[Unlock-Free](https://www.freeunlocks.com/) is a great option for unlocking your locked Xiaomi Redmi K70 phone. The steps are quite simple and hassle free, but do keep in mind that this is a paid service. You might be able to use a free offer from TrialPay in order to get your Xiaomi Redmi K70 phone unlocked for free.

### Here’s how you can use FreeUnlocks?

2\. After you select this button, you will taken to a new page where you will be prompted to enter 3 different pieces of information, such as the phone's SIM's availability, your country and your phone network.

3\. Once you enter all of this information correctly, click the ‘continue’ button. This button will take you to a payment page, and you will have to pay $9.99. At this point you will be sent an unlock code, and you should be able to unlock your phone and use it anywhere in the world.

## Part 4: Unlock-Free for Xiaomi unlock code
