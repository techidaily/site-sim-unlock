### Contact your carrier to unlock it with the IMEI code

When a customer deals an agreement with a large cell phone company for a certain amount of time, they usually get a discount on a device. Because of this, the Apple iPhone 13 device has a controller lock, so customers can only use it on their network. You can leave without paying anything if your contract with the company is over. Before you can unlock your Apple iPhone 13, you have to do the following:

First, it has to be legal. It means the Apple iPhone 13 device has not been reported as lost, stolen, or linked to a crime.

Then your bank account shouldn't have any debts. If you signed a contract in exchange for a lower price upfront, you would have to wait until your contract was up (usually 24 months) or pay the remaining balance if you bought your phone on a payment plan. Each company has its way of unlocking.

With that your Apple iPhone 13 is now completely unlock activated! You're free to use it as you please now.

In this article we've explained how to unlock T Mobile Apple iPhone 13 using DoctorSIM - SIM Unlock Service, and how to unlock T Mobile iPhone 5s using the T Mobile carrier itself. While both of them are perfectly legitimate means of unlocking your Apple iPhone 13s, I personally lean more towards the DoctorSIM solution as they don't have any pesky eligibility criteria, nor do they make you wait long. They are a 100% solution, especially considering they're a third-party tool which makes them less biased as they don't have an incentive to keep you from unlocking. Well, we hope this helped and hopefully now you have a T Mobile unlock iPhone!
