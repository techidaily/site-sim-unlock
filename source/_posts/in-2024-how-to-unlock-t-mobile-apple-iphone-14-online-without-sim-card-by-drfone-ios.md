Whether you want to know how to unlock iPhone with IMEI number or to simply know how to unlock iPhone using IMEI code, the methods mentioned above will no doubt see you through each and every step when unlocking your Apple iPhone 14.

## What to do if your Apple iPhone 14 has bad ESN or blacklisted IMEI?

Many people have iPhones but don’t know what an IMEI number is or what a bad ESN represents. Understanding how to tackle this issue can save time, money, and a headache or two. In this extensive guide, we’ll walk you through the basic mechanics of ESN and IMEI, how to check if your Apple iPhone 14 is blacklisted, and the detailed steps for unlocking a phone with a bad ESN or blacklisted IMEI.

## Part 1: Basic information about IMEI number and ESN

### What is IMEI number?

IMEI (International Mobile Equipment Identity): IMEI numbers are unique to GSM (Global System for Mobile Communications) and UMTS (Universal Mobile Telecommunications System) network mobile phones. Unlike ESN, an IMEI number is 15 digits long. It serves as an anti-theft measure, meaning a blacklisted IMEI can result from a device being reported lost or stolen or a breach of the consumer agreement.

![iPhone imei number check](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/iphone-imei-check.jpg)

### What is an ESN?

Electronic Serial Number (ESN): Previously utilized by CDMA (Code Division Multiple Access) networks, an ESN was a unique identifier for cellular devices. With technological progression, most carriers have shifted their focus to the IMEI system, but knowing your ESN’s history is still crucial, especially if you're dealing with older devices.

### What is a Bad ESN?

A Bad ESN can mean a lot of things, let’s check out some examples:

1. If you hear this term most probably you are trying to activate the Apple iPhone 14 device with a carrier, but that’s not possible due to some reasons.
2. It can mean that the previous owner of the Apple iPhone 14 device switched carriers.
3. The previous owner had an outstanding amount on their bill and cancelled the account without paying the bill first.
4. The previous owner didn’t have a bill when they cancelled the account but they were still under a contract and if you cancel sooner than the due date for the contract, an "early termination fee" is created based on the remaining period of the contract and they hadn’t paid that amount.
5. The person that sold you the phone or someone else who was the actual owner of the Apple iPhone 14 device reported the Apple iPhone 14 device as lost or stolen.

### What is a blacklisted IMEI?

Blacklisted IMEI is basically the same thing as Bad ESN but for devices that work on CDMA networks, like Verizon or Sprint. In short, the main reason that a device has a Blacklisted IMEI is so that you as the owner or someone else cannot activate the Apple iPhone 14 device on any carrier, not even the original one, thus avoiding selling or stealing the phone.

In order to check if an iPhone is blacklisted, you need to first [retrieve your IMEI](https://drfone.wondershare.com/unlock/imei-check-iphone.html) or ESN number to check if it’s blacklisted.

### How to find the IMEI or ESN numbers

1. On the original box of the iPhone, usually around the barcode.
2. In Settings, if you go to General > About, you can find the IMEI or ESN.
3. On some iPhones, it's in the SIM card tray when you pull it out.
4. Some iPhones have it engraved on the back of the case.
5. If you dial \*#06# on your dial pad you will get the IMEI or ESN.

### How to verify if your Apple iPhone 14 is blacklisted?

Checking if your Apple iPhone 14 has a blacklisted IMEI is the first step in addressing the issue. There are several methods to do this, either via the Apple website, the network carrier, or through third-party IMEI check services.

1. **Apple’s Blacklist Status Tool:** Operating directly from Apple's official website, entering your IMEI number can provide instant clarity on its status.
2. **Network Carrier Services:** Another way is to contact the carrier that the Apple iPhone 14 was initially sold from. Finding out is easy, just look for a logo: on the box of the iPhone, on the back case of it and even on the screen of the Apple iPhone 14 as it boots up. Just look for any carrier, Verizon, Sprint, T-Mobile, etc. Contacting your network carrier can also yield a blacklist status. Bear in mind that not all network services are equally adept or willing to communicate this information, and turnaround times may vary.
3. **Third-Party IMEI Check Services:** Utilizing third-party IMEI checkers is often the quickest method. These can be found as online services or apps, but it’s important to choose reputable sources. This is a highly recommended source to [check the status of your phone](https://www.doctorsim.com/libtrkafl.html?pc=43d47c30d945bcbd7d9527f4049f649a&refe=https://www.doctorsim.com/us-en/?scp&euro) because it’s quick, reliable and offers no fuss. You just go to the page, enter the IMEI or ESN, enter your contact details, and you’ll soon receive all the information you need!

## Part 3: What to do if your Apple iPhone 14 has bad ESN or blacklisted IMEI?

A bad ESN or blacklisted IMEI is serious business. It can result in a device being unusable on most of the surrounding networks. If your IMEI is blacklisted, there are steps for potential resolution:

### Ask the seller for a refund

If you bought the Apple iPhone 14 device with the bad ESN newly from a retailer or online shop, you might be in luck as they can provide you with a refund or at least a replacement, depending on their policy. For example, Amazon and eBay have refund policies. Unfortunately, if you got the phone from someone you found on the street, or from a seller over sources like Craigslist, this might not be possible. But there are still other things you can do.

![iPhone blacklisted imei](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/10-things-you-can-do-with-an-iphone-that-has-bad-esn-or-blacklisted-iemi-5.png)

### Use it as a gaming console or iPod

Smartphones have a whole lot of functionality besides being able to place calls. You can install a bunch of different video games in it, you can use it to surf the internet, watch videos over YouTube, download music and videos to it. You could even use it as an iPod. The possibilities are really endless. You can even install apps like Skype and use Skype call as an alternative to a phone call.

![iPhone blacklisted imei](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/10-things-you-can-do-with-an-iphone-that-has-bad-esn-or-blacklisted-iemi-6.jpg)

### Report of the Issue to the Police

If you suspect fraud or a theft may have been involved, filing a report can be necessary.

### Get the IMEI or ESN Cleaned

Depending on your carrier, you can see if they entertain requests to remove your IMEI from the blacklist. IMEI cleaning services exist, offering to remove the blacklisted status. However, proceed with caution, as this is often in a gray legal area.

![iPhone has bad esn](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/10-things-you-can-do-with-an-iphone-that-has-bad-esn-or-blacklisted-iemi-7.jpg)

### Swap the Logic Board

The thing about a blacklisted IMEI is that it’s only blacklisted in a particular country. An unlocked AT&T iPhone blacklisted in the US would still function in Australia on another network. As such you can try and change the chips of your Apple iPhone 14. However, in doing so you should be prepared for some possible irreparable damage.

![iPhone blacklisted imei](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/10-things-you-can-do-with-an-iphone-that-has-bad-esn-or-blacklisted-iemi-8.jpg)

### Unlock it and then Sell it

After your unlock your Apple iPhone 14 you can sell it to foreigners at a lowered rate. You can find out how to unlock in the next steps. But why would foreigners buy a blacklisted phone, you might ask? That’s because they won’t be on US soil long, and the IMEI is only blacklisted locally. So foreigners and tourists might be persuaded to buy your Apple iPhone 14 if you throw in a big enough discount.

![iPhone has bad esn](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/10-things-you-can-do-with-an-iphone-that-has-bad-esn-or-blacklisted-iemi-9.gif)

### Take it apart and sell the spare parts

You can dismember the logic board, screen, dock connector and back casing, and sell them separately. These may be used to help out other broken iPhones.

![what if iPhone has bad esn](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/10-things-you-can-do-with-an-iphone-that-has-bad-esn-or-blacklisted-iemi-10.jpg)

### Sell internationally

As mentioned earlier, you can unlock the phone with the blacklisted IMEI. However, since it’s only blacklisted locally, you can sell it internationally where it would still have value.

![iPhone bad esn](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/10-things-you-can-do-with-an-iphone-that-has-bad-esn-or-blacklisted-iemi-11.jpg)

### Flash phone to another carrier

This is an ideal option for those who don’t mind changing carriers. You can flash the phone to another carrier, as long as they accept it, and pretty soon you’ll have a functional phone! However, in some cases, you might land with a 3G connection instead of a 4G.

![bad esn iPhone 7](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/10-things-you-can-do-with-an-iphone-that-has-bad-esn-or-blacklisted-iemi-12_434.jpg)

### Determine Hybrid GSM/CDMA Phones

If your phone cannot activate on a CDMA carrier like Verizon or Sprint, the IMEI can still be used on a GSM network. Most phones manufactured these days come with a GSM standard nano or micro sim card slot and have GSM radio enabling for a GSM network. Most of them also come factory unlocked as well.

## Part 4: How to unlock a phone with bad ESN or blacklisted IMEI?

Unlocking a phone with bad ESN or a blacklisted IMEI is not a single-step process. It involves both technological and legal maneuvering. It's important to note that unlocking a blacklisted phone might not make it fully operational, but it can help in using it with carriers outside the country where it was blacklisted.

### Understanding Lock Status

Before proceeding, ensure you understand the lock status of your phone. If the phone is network locked, it only works with a specific carrier. If it is blacklisted, it’s barred from most network use. An unlocked phone, on the other hand, is a blank slate ready to work with any carrier that supports the Apple iPhone 14 device's technological specifications.

### Steps to Unlock

Here's a comprehensive overview of the steps to unlock a phone with a bad ESN or blacklisted IMEI:

1. ****Ascertain Legality:**** Ensure unlocking your phone is within the bounds of the law, both locally and globally. Legal provisions such as the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) in the US and similar laws elsewhere define the circumstances under which phone unlocking is legal.
2. ****Contact the Carrier:**** If the blacklisting issue has been resolved, contacting the carrier who blacklisted the Apple iPhone 14 device is the most straightforward way to unlock it. They may require clear documentation proving ownership of the Apple iPhone 14 device and the resolution of the reason for blacklisting.
3. ****Consider Third-Party Services:**** If your phone was blacklisted from a carrier in a different country where unlocking might be a common practice, third-party services can assist. Verify that they are reputable and have a solid track record, as well as a range of positive reviews from previous customers.
4. ****IMEI Repair and Unlock Tools:**** Some advanced users may consider IMEI repair software or unlock tools. However, utilizing these services could be illegal or fraudulent unless you are a certified technician who can verify the legitimacy of the software being used and the legality of the method in your region.
5. ****Seek Professional Repair Centers:**** If all else fails, there are mobile repair shops that specialize in this type of work. It’s important to vet these services thoroughly, and ensure they are trained in such repairs and have a history of success.

### Considerations and Warnings

#### **Q: I am the owner of the Apple iPhone 14 and I reported it as lost some time ago and I found it, can I cancel it?**

Yes, you can but most carriers will ask you to go to a retail store with at least one valid ID.

#### **Q: I dropped My Apple iPhone 14 and the screen cracked. Does it now have a bad ESN?**

Hardware damage has no relation with an ESN. So your ESN status will remain unchanged.

#### **Q: Is it Legal to Unlock a Phone with a Bad ESN or Blacklisted IMEI?**

The legality of unlocking a phone with a bad ESN or blacklisted IMEI varies from country to country and can be influenced by specific case laws. However, in cases where the user is the original owner and the phone is paid off, it's typically legal to unlock the Apple iPhone 14 device.

#### **Q: Can You Use a Blacklisted Phone Internationally?**

In some cases, a blacklisted phone can be used internationally. When a phone is blacklisted, it's typically barred from the carrier network where the blacklist was applied. However, different countries have different national blacklists, so it's possible that a phone blacklisted in one country will work in another. Unlocking the phone internationally can be an option here.

#### **Q: Can IMEI Cleaning Really Work?**

IMEI cleaning is the process by which the IMEI's blacklisted status is removed. There are services that offer to clean your IMEI, and while some may work, it’s important to understand the legality and efficacy of such services, as it may involve fraudulent activity and your phone may still not be fully operational on some networks even after being cleaned.

#### **Q: What Consequences Can I Face by Using a Blacklisted Phone?**

Using a blacklisted phone can have various consequences. It's unlikely to work on the network of the carrier where it was blacklisted, and the reliability of third-party carriers might be limited. Additionally, there may be legal implications, especially if the phone was blacklisted for being reported lost or stolen.

#### **Q: Should I Buy a Phone with a Bad ESN or Blacklisted IMEI?**

It's generally not advisable to purchase a phone with a bad ESN or blacklisted IMEI, as it would be difficult to use on most networks. Such devices are often sold at lower prices, but the risks and limitations associated with them might not be worth the discount.
