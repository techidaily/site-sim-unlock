## Network Locked SIM Card Inserted On Your Realme 12 Pro+ 5G Phone? Unlock It Now

Carriers provide cellular connections so you can access the Internet, send text messages, and make phone calls without Wi-Fi. You cannot escape the carriers once you begin using a cell phone.

Customers can purchase a new handset via carriers or the mobile phone market. You may need an unlocked phone if you wish to use a different carrier's service on your smartphone. However, if you want a gadget linked to a specific SIM card, you may buy one from the carriers for a reduced price.

## Part 1: What Does It Mean If Your Realme 12 Pro+ 5G Asks for SIM Network PIN?

When your phone prompts you to enter a SIM Network Unlock PIN, it means that your device is currently locked to a specific mobile network carrier, and it can only be used with SIM cards from that carrier. This locking mechanism is usually put in place by the carrier or the phone manufacturer to ensure that you continue to use their services, typically for the duration of a contract. As a result, your phone cannot be freely used with SIM cards from other carriers until it's unlocked using the correct PIN or code.

## Part 2: Why Does Your Realme 12 Pro+ 5G Say Invalid SIM Card – Network Locked SIM Card Inserted?

![remove network lock](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/11/fix-network-locked-simcard-inserted-2.jpg)

**System Errors**

Since SIM locking is a smartphone restriction implemented to stop it from being used on other networks, Android system errors can cause network-locked SIM cards. Resetting these errors can help unlock your **network locked SIM card inserted** device. Service providers decided to provide a formal SIM unlocking option as a result.

Because of this, any locked SIM may be readily unlocked, and once a device opens, it can work like a conventional mobile phone and with any SIM card of the user's choosing.

**Carrier Lock**

The consumer must stick with the same service provider for a specific time after purchasing the bundled device and data pack. This is called a carrier lock on the Realme 12 Pro+ 5G device and is one of the most common errors in **network locked SIM card inserted** devices. During that time, the Realme 12 Pro+ 5G device will be network- or SIM-locked, prohibiting the user from changing service providers.

The user cannot change the SIM. The service provider will offer the SIM Unlock code needed to unlock the handset when the contract expires. The gadget can be used with any other SIM card and exported to another country without problems when the network lock has been removed.

**Region Lock**

Apple and AT&T initially worked together to implement the SIM lock and the SIM locked devices. The original purpose was to force the user to continue using the same service provider in a specific area or time.

However, some telecom service providers sell the handsets with select data plans as bundled plans in collaboration with the Realme 12 Pro+ 5G device manufacturers. As a result, the handset will cost less than it would otherwise. Sometimes, these offers are particular to a specific region, called a carrier lock.

**Firmware Problems**

Sometimes, the Realme 12 Pro+ 5G device manufacturers release many versions of the same firmware for different geographical locations.

As a result, it may be possible that the user may face contradictions in the agreement of device firmware and the network-locked SIM card that was supposed to be used on the Realme 12 Pro+ 5G device. Due to firmware problems, the users may also face a network-locked SIM card-inserted device.

## Part 4: Why is SIM Unlocking Important?

As previously stated, a SIM lock enables a service provider to stop a customer from using the smartphone with the SIM cards of another service provider. This guarantees that the Realme 12 Pro+ 5G device is only being used with the original SIM card for each provider. This locking also has a lot of drawbacks because it is incompatible with any other SIM card.

1. The phone cannot be used with other SIM cards if the SIM lock is enabled. Customers must therefore adhere to the current plan as is.
2. Since nobody wants to purchase a locked phone, it is hard for someone to sell or gift the mobile.
3. Traveling abroad with a SIM-locked phone could provide some challenges because you won't be able to use a local SIM card on the phone while you're there.

All the problems can be fixed, and the SIM works in any nation with the removed SIM lock.

### Conclusion

Any of the methods above can work to get around the prohibition against using other SIM cards with your Android handset. The best thing about using Dr.Fone-Screen Unlock is that you don't need unlocking codes to complete the tasks.

![customer service](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/02/unlock-sim-without-puk-code-02.jpg)

Here’s what you’ll need:

- **Ready your information.** Prepare your account number, phone number, and any other relevant details your carrier might require for verification.
- **Find the best contact option for you.** Most carriers offer multiple options like phone calls, online chat, or visiting a physical store. Opt for the method that best suits your preference and availability.
- **Prepare a written report of what happened.** Clearly state that you’ve locked your SIM card by entering an incorrect PIN and have lost your PUK code.
- **Verify your identity.**Answer the security questions or provide the requested account details to confirm that you’re the authorized user.
- **Receive your PUK code/new SIM card.** Once verified, the representative will provide you with your PUK code. Be sure to write it down in a secure location for future reference. They might offer you a replaced SIM card if no PUK codes exist.
- **Unlock your SIM card.**Enter the PUK code on your phone following the specific instructions provided by your carrier. This typically involves entering the PUK code followed by a new PIN.

### Method 2: Retrieving the PUK Code Through Your Carrier’s Website

Many mobile carriers offer self-service options on their websites, allowing you to manage your account and access information independently. If your carrier provides this functionality, you can retrieve your PUK code online without contacting customer service. This way, you’ll learn **how to unlock SIM cards without PUK numbers**.

Here’s how it might work:

- **Step 1:** Navigate to the secure section of your account using your login credentials. For example, this is what you can see from the JIO website:

![jio website](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/02/unlock-sim-without-puk-code-03.jpg)

- **Step 2:** Different carriers have varying website layouts, so refer to their specific instructions or search features to find the dedicated section for retrieving PUK codes.
- **Step 3:** Similar to contacting customer service, you might need to verify your account ownership through security questions or other verification methods.
- **Step 4:** Once verified, your PUK code should be displayed on the screen or sent to your registered email address.

Remember, these steps are general guidelines, and specific procedures may vary depending on your carrier. Consult your carrier’s website or contact customer service for the most accurate and up-to-date information.

By following these official routes, you can safely and securely bypass the PUK code hurdle and regain access to your vital mobile services. Stay tuned for Part 2, where you’ll explore alternative unlocking methods for those who prefer a different approach.

## Part 2: Unlocking SIM Cards With the Help of a Third-Party Tool

While official methods through your carrier are always recommended, some situations might arise where you’ll need to learn **how to unlock SIM cards without PUK** **codes.** Third-party tools like [Wondershare Dr.Fone](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/drfone-toolkit/) offer an alternative approach in such cases.
