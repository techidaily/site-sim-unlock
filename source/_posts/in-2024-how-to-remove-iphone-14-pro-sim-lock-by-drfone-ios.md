## Contact Your Carrier to Unlock iPhone 8/8Plus

If your Apple iPhone 14 Pro is locked, then it must be for some reason. The carrier who has set this lock can provide the best solution.

### Check the unlock prerequisites

To check the unlock prerequisites, Go to Settings > General > About to find out if your Apple iPhone 14 Pro is locked. Your Apple iPhone 14 Pro is unlocked if it says "No SIM restrictions" next to "Carrier Lock."

### Contact the carrier for the unlock code

Large cell phone companies often offer discounted devices to customers who sign an agreement for set time frames. Because of this, the Apple iPhone 14 Pro device comes with a controller lock so customers can only use it on their network. If your contract with the company is over, you can get out of it for free. Before you can unlock your Apple iPhone 14 Pro, you must meet the following requirements:

First of all, it must be a legal device. It means the Apple iPhone 14 Pro device is not reported as lost, stolen. Then your bank account must not have any financial debts. If you signed a contract in exchange for a lower up-front cost, you'd have to wait until your contract ends (usually 24 months) or pay the remaining balance if you purchased your phone on a payment schedule.

Most carriers need active accounts for specific days before unlocking devices. Sprint has 50 days, T-Mobile 40, and AT&T 60. Verizon has no minimum period if you need to factory reset your phone to use the new network and back up beforehand.

## How to Unlock Apple iPhone 14 Pro with IMEI Code?

If you have a locked iPhone, we have different methods that entail how to unlock iPhone with IMEI code. Apart from this, we have two separate unlocking methods which usually confuse a good number of people. These methods are Sim Unlock and iCloud activation lock bypass. The difference between the two is that the Sim unlock method involves unlocking the sim lock while the iCloud activation revolves around unlocking the automatic iCloud activation security feature.  

If you want to know how to unlock iPhone with IMEI number and how to bypass iCloud lock, I have with me two different methods that will unlock your locked iPhone in a span of days as long as you follow the required steps.

**1.1 Dial \*#06#**

This is the primary method of checking your IMEI code on almost all devices. On your dial pad, dial \*#06# and press the call icon. Your unique code will be displayed immediately.

## Part 1: Defining ICCID Code and Its Need

At the heart of every iPhone's connectivity lies the ICCID code. It is an acronym for Integrated Circuit Card Identifier. This unique numerical sequence is more than a string of digits. It serves as a crucial identifier for your SIM card. Every ICCID code is exclusive to a specific SIM card, like each person has a distinct fingerprint. This enables mobile carriers and networks to recognize and authenticate the Apple iPhone 14 Pro device.

The ICCID code is essential for your Apple iPhone 14 Pro to connect smoothly to cellular networks. When you put a SIM card in your Apple iPhone 14 Pro, the Apple iPhone 14 Pro device reads the ICCID code. This code helps identify the carrier, subscription details, and network services.
