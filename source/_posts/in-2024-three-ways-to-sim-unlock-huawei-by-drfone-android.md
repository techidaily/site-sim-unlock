## Three Ways to Sim Unlock Huawei Nova Y71

You probably purchased your Huawei Nova Y71 for a significant discount but are now stuck with the same network for a couple of years. You loved the Huawei Nova Y71 device but your network provider does not have any plans that exactly suit your needs. To release your device from your current network's clutches, you will need to unlock your phone.

There are three ways you can do it and this post will go through each method so that you can find one that you are most comfortable with. Do note that if your contract has ended with your network provider, this "How to unlock Huawei Nova Y71" post can be skipped as you can just ask them to unlock your phone or purchase a [sim network unlock pin](https://drfone.wondershare.com/unlock/unlock-samsung-sim-network-unlock-pin.html) for a minimal price.

## Part 1: Huawei Nova Y71 Unlock Code

This is probably the easiest, no-fuss method to [sim unlock](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/unlock-android-screen/) Huawei Nova Y71. Follow these steps carefully to successfully perform Huawei Nova Y71 unlock code.

Do take note that this process may not work with your carrier. Therefore, always check if this is the right way to obtain the necessary code:

## Part 3: Huawei Nova Y71 Unlock Carrier

If your Huawei Nova Y71 is hard locked, this is your best bet in getting your device unlocked. Actually, it is the safest method among all three:

1. Get a new SIM card from a new carrier.
2. Call your carrier's customer service line and ask what are the requirements to qualify you to get your Huawei Nova Y71 unlocked. If you have honored your contract, there should not be any problems. However, do ask your carrier if there are any additional requirements. Do note that there may be fees involved.
3. Once your customer service representative has determined if you have met all their requirements, they should give you the SIM network unlock PIN Huawei Nova Y71. Again, depending on your carrier, they might either give you the code over the phone, through email or via SMS. If you have the choice, always opt for email or SMS so that you are able to jot down the right number.
4. Once you have gotten the code, insert the new SIM card (from your new carrier). You will receive a prompt to enter your code. Make sure that you key in the right code---entering the wrong code will cause your phone to be locked (possibly forever).

## Part 4: Huawei Nova Y71 Unlock App/Software

There are some of us out there who are just not confident with doing things ourselves or trusting our own carrier.

HOWEVER, if your first instinct is to head to Google Play to look for SIM unlock tools, heed these cautions. There are currently many apps that claim that they can unlock your phone but it is just a scam. You should also avoid torrent files available online.

## Part 5: The benefits of an unlocked Huawei Nova Y71

If you now know how to unlock Huawei Nova Y71 but still do not know its advantages, we are here to help.

As indicated in the introduction, unlocked phone users can freely choose the plans they subscribed to---on any carriers, in any country. Therefore, if you travel frequently around the world, having an unlocked Huawei Nova Y71 would be beneficial. Using a local SIM card is much cheaper than paying for exorbitant roaming charges.

You can also benefit from an unlocked Huawei Nova Y71 if you are the kind of person who likes to take advantage of current offers provided by your local carriers. Prepaid plans are always changing in terms of offering so having the flexibility of changing carriers and prepaid plans can help you save money in the long run.

## Part 6: The downside of an unlocked Huawei Nova Y71

Are you thinking "Well, why can't I just buy an unlocked Huawei Nova Y71 in the first place?" right about now? Well, you can but think of the amount of money it will cost you.

For example, in Australia, an unlocked Huawei Nova Y71 will cost around $499 from any Huawei outlet but $0 for the Huawei Nova Y71 device when you pair it with a 24-month postpaid plan. While this may look attractive now, you may be paying more for a locked Huawei Nova Y71 in the long run.

## Conclusion

Now that you know the three ways of unlocking your Huawei Nova Y71, all you need to do is find one that is most compatible with you. Just remember to think of everything through and carefully. Most importantly, if you have a locked device, always seek advice from your carrier to see if this is possible.

## Part 1: How To Check if an Android/iPhone Is Unlocked

Before delving into specific methods, let’s address the most direct way to confirm your phone’s unlock status: the SIM card swap. This is one of the main ways **how to tell if a phone is unlocked**. Insert a SIM card from a carrier different from your current provider.

If the phone accepts the new SIM and allows calls and data usage, congratulations, your phone is unlocked! Conversely, if the phone displays an error message like “SIM Not Supported” or “Invalid SIM,” it’s likely locked to your current carrier.

### How To Check if Your iPhone Is Unlocked

For iPhone users, navigating the unlock status involves a quick trip to your device settings:

- **Step 1:**Open your iPhone’s Settings app.
- **Step 2:** Navigate to **General** in Settings, then tap **About**.
- **Step 3:** Scroll down and check for **Carrier Lock** or **Service Provider Lock**. If it says **No SIM Restrictions**, your phone is unlocked. It’s easy to learn **how to tell if a phone is unlocked** when using an iPhone.

**Note:** Some manufacturers offer dedicated tools or apps to check unlock status. Consult your device’s manual or website for specific instructions.

### Carrier-Specific Solutions: Unlocking the Details

While the above methods provide general guidance, certain carriers might offer dedicated methods to verify the unlock status. For example, Verizon offers two ways to answer your question, “**how do I know if my Verizon phone is unlocked**?”

- **Contract check.**Review your Verizon contract to see if the unlock eligibility date has passed since the contract’s execution.
- **Unlocking process.**Visit the Verizon website and initiate the unlocking process. If successful, you’ll receive confirmation of your phone’s unlocked status.

**Note:** The process for other carriers is usually similar. Check their respective websites or contact their customer support for specific details. Asking the carrier is also a great way **how to check if a phone is unlocked.**

Unlocking your phone might have restrictions depending on your carrier and contract. Always check their policies and procedures before proceeding.

### Method 2: Unlocking With Your Carrier’s Official Methods

As mentioned earlier, carriers often provide official routes to unlock their devices. While typically requiring compliance with specific criteria, this method ensures you stay within your carrier’s policies.

Most carriers offer two common methods for unlocking their phones:

- **Paying an upfront fee.**If your contract period is still ongoing, certain carriers allow unlocking upon payment of a predetermined fee. Check your carrier’s website or contact customer support for eligibility and fee details.
- **Requesting a SIM unlock.**Once your contract has expired and you meet the carrier’s eligibility criteria (e.g., device payment completion), you can submit an official unlock request. Carriers typically have dedicated online portals or customer service channels for this process.

Remember, each carrier has its policies and procedures regarding unlocking. Consult your carrier’s official website or contact customer support for specific instructions and eligibility requirements.
