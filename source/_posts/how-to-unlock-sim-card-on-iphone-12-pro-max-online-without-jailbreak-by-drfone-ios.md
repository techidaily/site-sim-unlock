## How to Unlock SIM Card on Apple iPhone 12 Pro Max online without jailbreak

Isn't it so frustrating when you try to change your SIM or your network, but just can't because your phone is locked under contract? Phones are our life source in this global age, it's our tether to reality, to the world! But if you have a carrier locked phone, then that connection is basically under contract by an external agency! You can't change your networks, there are limitations on how you use your phone, and when you have to travel abroad you have no option other than paying the roaming charges. If you, say, have an iPhone 5c and have these frustrations, it's likely you're already wondering how to unlock the Apple iPhone 12 Pro Max 5c.

Chances are that if you've had a carrier locked phone for a while, you might have already forgotten what cellular freedom feels like. But we're here to remind you. All you have to do is break that carrier-lock, and you're good to go. However, you should be careful when doing so, cause if you try using a jailbreaking technique, it could have major repercussions. So we're here to give you some valuable advice about how to unlock iPhone 5, iPhone 5c, or even Android phones.

## Part 1: Unlock SIM Card on iPhone and Android via jailbreak

Before we get into telling you how to unlock iPhone 5, or the SIM Card on iPhone or Android, we should first tell you what Jailbreaking is. You might have heard of this term before, and I'm sure it sounded ominous to you. Jailbreak? It sounds awfully close to 'Prison break.' Well, considering the carrier lock is sort of like a prison for your cell, it is an accurate terminology. But Jailbreak isn't just about breaking the carrier lock. That might happen as a by-product, but the real purpose is to break free of the software restrictions which are generally applied to Apple devices. This might seem like a good option because, well, who doesn't want to break free of all of Apple's restrictions? But that always comes at several heavy risks.

### Threats of unlocking SIM via Jailbreak

#### 1\. Not Permanent

This has got to be one of the biggest reasons for not jailbreaking your phone. It is not at all permanent! In fact, the moment you update your system, your jailbreak is lost and if you've started using a different SIM it will no longer function, and you're gonna have to go back to using that Carrier you tried so hard to escape from! It's really not worth the effort. Of course, you could stop updating altogether, but then that will bring us to…

![Unlock SIM Card on iPhone and Android via jailbreak](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2016/10/14771444107532.jpg)

#### 2\. Risky

If you don't update your iOS, or Mac or iPad or any device at all, in this day and age, you're basically just asking to be hacked. That is not to excuse those who do the hacking and plant malware on your system, but if you leave your front door open in a shitty neighborhood, well then you only have yourself to blame once you get robbed!

#### 3\. Warranty

Jailbreaking has now become kind-of-legal, in a very tenuous sense, but that doesn't mean Apple wholeheartedly welcomes jailbreaking. If you do so, you will never again be able to avail of the warranty on your phone. And with the kind of major bucks you have to shell out for those iPhones, you best keep that warranty intact.

#### 4\. Lack of Apps

Many top-notch and crucial app companies and organizations simply refuse to make their applications usable in jailbreak phones, as they are extremely risky and prone to hacking. As a result, you would have to rely on a bunch of non-professional apps made by amateurs, which is more likely to put your phone in harm's way.

#### 5\. Bricking

This basically means your whole system may crash and stop functioning. As a result, you're gonna' have to restore the whole thing and try to salvage whatever information you can. Now those who do jailbreak regularly will give you all kinds of excuses like it happens only rarely or that you can retrieve your data simply from the cloud, et al. But do you really want to divest all your time and energy trying to fight off malware, backing up all your data, etc, especially when there is a much more convenient option just around the corner?

Didn't think so.

## Part 4: How to unlock Verizon iPhone via Verizon

This is an alternative means by which you can unlock Verizon iPhone 5. However, before we show you how to unlock Verizon iPhone, we should probably answer some frequently asked questions about this.

#### Can Verizon iPhones be unlocked?

The long and short of this is: YES, Verizon iPhones can be unlocked.

#### Will Verizon Unlock my Phone?

Now here's the kicker. Verizon is actually one of the most relaxed carriers out there and they don't generally lock their devices to begin with. However, YES, if your device is locked, Verizon does offer the service to unlock your phone if you contact them.

#### How to unlock Verizon iPhone via Verizon

As mentioned above, Verizon is surprisingly lax when it comes to locking phones, especially iPhones. In fact all Verizon 4G LTE devices are never locked to begin with, you can directly use them with any other carriers. So, if you want to shift Carriers, they just have a bunch of requirements that you need to meet first:

1\. If the phone was purchased on a 2 year contract then your contract needs to be complete with all 24 months paid for.

2\. If the purchase of the Apple iPhone 12 Pro Max device was financed by Verizon Edge, or a two-year device payment plan, in that case you need to have paid off all overdue bills before you shift.

3\. The device shouldn't currently be reported as lost or stolen. Furthermore, if the Apple iPhone 12 Pro Max device has ever been associated with any form of fraudulent activity then you aren't eligible.

4\. And if your phone still seems locked for none of the stated reasons you just contact them directly and they'll take care of it. There is no complicated means of doing this.

If you meet these requirements then you don't need to bother unlocking it, you can simply use another carrier.

If this seems too good to be true, or you have trouble believing us, then head on over to their Unlocking Policies and read it for yourself, just follow this link: [http://www.verizon.com/about/consumer-safety/device-unlocking-policy](http://www.verizon.com/about/consumer-safety/device-unlocking-policy)

Here's a little screenshot for you:

## Part 5: How to check your Verizon iPhone unlock status

If you're not sure whether you're still within the 2 year contract period or aren't sure whether your phone model is eligible for automatic unlock, then you can simply verify that via DoctorSIM with an easy 3-step process. You should avail of this before going through any official channels to unlock Verizon iPhone 5. All you have to do is go to this link [here](https://www.doctorsim.com/libtrkafl.html?pc=43d47c30d945bcbd7d9527f4049f649a&refe=https://www.doctorsim.com/us-en/?scp&euro) and then follow the given steps.

However, if you use a third party service like DoctorSIM - SIM Unlock Service then you don't have to bother about the requirements and don't have to bother verifying whether you're eligible, and you don't have to wait for 2 whole years before you can avail of your fundamental right to use whatever service you damn well please! DoctorSIM helps you take that agency onto your own hands and change your carrier whenever you want, and its an additional bonus that the process is ridiculously easy to follow, permanent, and doesn't lapse your warranty either.

### Unlock it via IMEI code

Contacting your carrier to unlock the sim lock on your Apple iPhone 12 Pro Max is legit and straightway. But before contacting your carrier, you must fulfill the following conditions.

- The device must be legal, which means the Apple iPhone 12 Pro Max device has not been reported as lost, stolen, or connected to a crime.
- You shouldn't have any debts in your bank account.
- If you signed a contract in exchange for a lower upfront price, you would have to wait until your contract expires (typically 24 months) or pay the remaining amount if you purchased your phone on a payment plan.

If you meet the above conditions, you can get the phone unlocked from your carrier. You have to provide them IMEI number of your device. However, the rest of the unlocking process is different for each company.
