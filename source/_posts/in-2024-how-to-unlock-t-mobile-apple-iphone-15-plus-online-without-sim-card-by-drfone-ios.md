However, contacting the carriers directly is also a legitimate means. So read on to find out how to unlock T Mobile iPhone 5s via T Mobile carrier.

### How to unlock T Mobile iPhone 5s via T Mobile carrier

They are a 100% solution, especially considering they're a third-party tool which makes them less biased as they don't have an incentive to keep you from unlocking.
