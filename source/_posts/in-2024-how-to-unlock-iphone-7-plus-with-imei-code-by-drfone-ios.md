## How to Unlock Apple iPhone 7 Plus with IMEI Code?

If you have a locked iPhone, we have different methods that entail how to unlock iPhone with IMEI code. Apart from this, we have two separate unlocking methods which usually confuse a good number of people. These methods are Sim Unlock and iCloud activation lock bypass. The difference between the two is that the Sim unlock method involves unlocking the sim lock while the iCloud activation revolves around unlocking the automatic iCloud activation security feature.  

If you want to know how to unlock iPhone with IMEI number and how to bypass iCloud lock, I have with me two different methods that will unlock your locked iPhone in a span of days as long as you follow the required steps.  

## Part 1: What is IMEI code? How to find IMEI Code on iPhone?

Each and every phone comes with a unique 15-digit code that differentiates it from other devices. This unique code acts as determinant or a tracking number when you happen to lose your phone. For those with iPhones, you can retrieve this unique number in different ways. The following are some of them.

**1.1 Dial \*#06#**

This is the primary method of checking your IMEI code on almost all devices. On your dial pad, dial \*#06# and press the call icon. Your unique code will be displayed immediately.

**1.2 The Sim Tray**

Another way of retrieving your IMEI code is by removing your Sim Card tray. In most devices especially iPhone 4, this number is usually located on the Sim tray.

**1.3 The Back of the Phone**

## Part 1: Basic information about IMEI number and ESN

### What is IMEI number?

IMEI (International Mobile Equipment Identity): IMEI numbers are unique to GSM (Global System for Mobile Communications) and UMTS (Universal Mobile Telecommunications System) network mobile phones. Unlike ESN, an IMEI number is 15 digits long. It serves as an anti-theft measure, meaning a blacklisted IMEI can result from a device being reported lost or stolen or a breach of the consumer agreement.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### What is an ESN?

Electronic Serial Number (ESN): Previously utilized by CDMA (Code Division Multiple Access) networks, an ESN was a unique identifier for cellular devices. With technological progression, most carriers have shifted their focus to the IMEI system, but knowing your ESN’s history is still crucial, especially if you're dealing with older devices.

### What is a Bad ESN?

A Bad ESN can mean a lot of things, let’s check out some examples:

1. If you hear this term most probably you are trying to activate the Apple iPhone 7 Plus device with a carrier, but that’s not possible due to some reasons.
2. It can mean that the previous owner of the Apple iPhone 7 Plus device switched carriers.
3. The previous owner had an outstanding amount on their bill and cancelled the account without paying the bill first.
4. The previous owner didn’t have a bill when they cancelled the account but they were still under a contract and if you cancel sooner than the due date for the contract, an "early termination fee" is created based on the remaining period of the contract and they hadn’t paid that amount.
5. The person that sold you the phone or someone else who was the actual owner of the Apple iPhone 7 Plus device reported the Apple iPhone 7 Plus device as lost or stolen.

### What is a blacklisted IMEI?

Blacklisted IMEI is basically the same thing as Bad ESN but for devices that work on CDMA networks, like Verizon or Sprint. In short, the main reason that a device has a Blacklisted IMEI is so that you as the owner or someone else cannot activate the Apple iPhone 7 Plus device on any carrier, not even the original one, thus avoiding selling or stealing the phone.

### Ask the seller for a refund

If you bought the Apple iPhone 7 Plus device with the bad ESN newly from a retailer or online shop, you might be in luck as they can provide you with a refund or at least a replacement, depending on their policy. For example, Amazon and eBay have refund policies. Unfortunately, if you got the phone from someone you found on the street, or from a seller over sources like Craigslist, this might not be possible. But there are still other things you can do.

### Swap the Logic Board

As such you can try and change the chips of your Apple iPhone 7 Plus. However, in doing so you should be prepared for some possible irreparable damage.

### Unlock it and then Sell it

After your unlock your Apple iPhone 7 Plus you can sell it to foreigners at a lowered rate. You can find out how to unlock in the next steps.

### Determine Hybrid GSM/CDMA Phones

If your phone cannot activate on a CDMA carrier like Verizon or Sprint, the IMEI can still be used on a GSM network. Most phones manufactured these days come with a GSM standard nano or micro sim card slot and have GSM radio enabling for a GSM network. Most of them also come factory unlocked as well.

Having a phone with bad ESN or blacklisted IMEI is naturally a headache, however, all hope isn’t lost. You can do any of the things mentioned in the previous steps, and you can read on to find out how to unlock the phone with bad ESN or blacklisted IMEI.

## Part 4: How to unlock a phone with bad ESN or blacklisted IMEI?

Unlocking a phone with bad ESN or a blacklisted IMEI is not a single-step process. It involves both technological and legal maneuvering. It's important to note that unlocking a blacklisted phone might not make it fully operational, but it can help in using it with carriers outside the country where it was blacklisted.

### Understanding Lock Status

Before proceeding, ensure you understand the lock status of your phone. If the phone is network locked, it only works with a specific carrier. If it is blacklisted, it’s barred from most network use.

### Steps to Unlock

Here's a comprehensive overview of the steps to unlock a phone with a bad ESN or blacklisted IMEI:

1. ****Ascertain Legality:**** Ensure unlocking your phone is within the bounds of the law, both locally and globally. Legal provisions such as the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) in the US and similar laws elsewhere define the circumstances under which phone unlocking is legal.
2. ****Contact the Carrier:**** If the blacklisting issue has been resolved, contacting the carrier who blacklisted the Apple iPhone 7 Plus device is the most straightforward way to unlock it. They may require clear documentation proving ownership of the Apple iPhone 7 Plus device and the resolution of the reason for blacklisting.
3. ****Consider Third-Party Services:**** If your phone was blacklisted from a carrier in a different country where unlocking might be a common practice, third-party services can assist. Verify that they are reputable and have a solid track record, as well as a range of positive reviews from previous customers.
4. ****IMEI Repair and Unlock Tools:**** Some advanced users may consider IMEI repair software or unlock tools. However, utilizing these services could be illegal or fraudulent unless you are a certified technician who can verify the legitimacy of the software being used and the legality of the method in your region.
5. ****Seek Professional Repair Centers:**** If all else fails, there are mobile repair shops that specialize in this type of work. It’s important to vet these services thoroughly, and ensure they are trained in such repairs and have a history of success.

### Considerations and Warnings

- ****Device Warranty:**** Unlocking a phone could void its warranty. Consider the cost-benefit of unlocking versus keeping the Apple iPhone 7 Plus device under warranty.
- ****Legal Ramifications:**** Unauthorized unlocking can have legal repercussions. It’s important to research and ensure compliance with all relevant laws.
- ****Financial Risks:**** Some services come at a high cost, and there are scams in the market. Be cautious and only deal with recognized and trusted entities.

## Part 5: Frequently Asked Questions

#### **Q: Can I find out if this iPhone is reported as lost or stolen? I mean which one is it?**

This information is anonymous to carriers and no one will be able to tell you exactly.

#### **Q: I have a friend who wants to sell me an iPhone, how do I check if it has a bad ESN or if it’s lost or stolen before I buy it?**

You will need to check the IMEI or ESN.

![iphone imei check](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/iphone-imei-check.jpg)

#### **Q: I am the owner of the Apple iPhone 7 Plus and I reported it as lost some time ago and I found it, can I cancel it?**

Yes, you can but most carriers will ask you to go to a retail store with at least one valid ID.

#### **Q: I dropped My Apple iPhone 7 Plus and the screen cracked. Does it now have a bad ESN?**

Hardware damage has no relation with an ESN. So your ESN status will remain unchanged.

#### **Q: Is it Legal to Unlock a Phone with a Bad ESN or Blacklisted IMEI?**

The legality of unlocking a phone with a bad ESN or blacklisted IMEI varies from country to country and can be influenced by specific case laws. However, in cases where the user is the original owner and the phone is paid off, it's typically legal to unlock the Apple iPhone 7 Plus device.

#### **Q: Can You Use a Blacklisted Phone Internationally?**

In some cases, a blacklisted phone can be used internationally. When a phone is blacklisted, it's typically barred from the carrier network where the blacklist was applied. However, different countries have different national blacklists, so it's possible that a phone blacklisted in one country will work in another. Unlocking the phone internationally can be an option here.

#### **Q: Can IMEI Cleaning Really Work?**

IMEI cleaning is the process by which the IMEI's blacklisted status is removed. There are services that offer to clean your IMEI, and while some may work, it’s important to understand the legality and efficacy of such services, as it may involve fraudulent activity and your phone may still not be fully operational on some networks even after being cleaned.

#### **Q: What Consequences Can I Face by Using a Blacklisted Phone?**

Using a blacklisted phone can have various consequences. It's unlikely to work on the network of the carrier where it was blacklisted, and the reliability of third-party carriers might be limited. Additionally, there may be legal implications, especially if the phone was blacklisted for being reported lost or stolen.

#### **Q: Should I Buy a Phone with a Bad ESN or Blacklisted IMEI?**

It's generally not advisable to purchase a phone with a bad ESN or blacklisted IMEI, as it would be difficult to use on most networks. Such devices are often sold at lower prices, but the risks and limitations associated with them might not be worth the discount.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, a phone with a bad ESN or blacklisted IMEI presents a unique set of challenges. The complexity of resolving the issue hinges on various factors including the reasons for blacklisting, the phone model, and the networks involved, among others. The best approach is often a mix of legal recourse, communication with carriers, and potentially seeking the assistance of professional technicians or legal counsel. Always research thoroughly and seek advice from reliable sources when taking the significant step of unlocking a phone with a bad ESN or blacklisted IMEI.

So now you know everything there is to know about IMEI, bad ESN, and blacklisted iPhones. You also know how to check their status using the handy Dr.Fone webpage or through contacting your carrier.
