**Unlocking Verizon's Prepaid Device**

After activation, devices you buy from Verizon and some devices you buy from one of their authorized retailers are locked for 60 days.

After the first 60 days, their phones are locked, but after that, they never lock them again.

- Turn off your device.
- SIM card out.
