## Contact Your Carrier to Unlock iPhone 8/8Plus

If your Apple iPhone XS is locked, then it must be for some reason. The carrier who has set this lock can provide the best solution.

### Check the unlock prerequisites

To check the unlock prerequisites, Go to Settings > General > About to find out if your Apple iPhone XS is locked. Your Apple iPhone XS is unlocked if it says "No SIM restrictions" next to "Carrier Lock."

### Contact the carrier for the unlock code

Large cell phone companies often offer discounted devices to customers who sign an agreement for set time frames. Because of this, the Apple iPhone XS device comes with a controller lock so customers can only use it on their network. If your contract with the company is over, you can get out of it for free. Before you can unlock your Apple iPhone XS, you must meet the following requirements:

First of all, it must be a legal device. It means the Apple iPhone XS device is not reported as lost, stolen. Then your bank account must not have any financial debts. If you signed a contract in exchange for a lower up-front cost, you'd have to wait until your contract ends (usually 24 months) or pay the remaining balance if you purchased your phone on a payment schedule.

Most carriers need active accounts for specific days before unlocking devices. Sprint has 50 days, T-Mobile 40, and AT&T 60. Verizon has no minimum period if you need to factory reset your phone to use the new network and back up beforehand.

### Insert a new SIM card to unlock your device

If you have a non-carrier SIM card, complete iPhone unlocking using these steps:

- Turn off your device.
- SIM card out.
- Insert the new SIM. Your device will be activated.

### Conclusion

So, this was an overview of some popular unlocking tools for Apple iPhone XS. The most accurate and effective tool to unlock carrier-locked iPhones is Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock (iOS). If your Apple iPhone XS is locked, then it must be for some reason. The carrier who has set this lock can provide the best solution. However, Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock can unlock any lock.

## How to Check iPhone SIM Lock Status?

Before you try any other solution, you should check the nature of the Lock on your Apple iPhone XS. Once you know the problem, you can move on to the right solution.

<!-- affiliate ads begin -->
<a href="https://modlily.sjv.io/c/5597632/1997817/17059" target="_top" id="1997817"><img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17059-1997817" border="0" alt="" width="300" height="250"/></a><img height="0" width="0" src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1997817/17059" style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0" />
<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### 1\. Contact your service provider

Well, this is not a quick solution. You must contact your service provider to determine the sim lock status. Generally, you have to submit a request to the company and the IMEI number. The company will later inform you about the Sim lock status of your Apple iPhone XS through E-mail or any other channel.

### 2\. Check it via "Carrier Lock" in "Settings."

Navigate to Settings > General > About.

![carrier lock](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/12/unlock-iphone-online-7.jpg)

Apple has added a new Network Provider Lock section to iOS 14 that immediately tells you the Apple iPhone XS device's status.

Scroll down to find the section called "Network Provider Lock." If the Apple iPhone XS is unlocked, it should say "No SIM restrictions" on the screen. If you see something different, it means the Apple iPhone XS is locked.

### 3\. Check it via your IMEI code

If you know the IMEI number of your Apple iPhone XS, you can get one of those online IMEI-checking tools to see if the phone it belongs to is locked. Most of these services ask for money, which is a problem but generally, they ask for a very minimal amount.

### Conclusion

So, these were the ways to unlock your Apple iPhone XS online. Knowing about online unlocking services, you must have realized that you should trust them sparingly. Instead, you should go for a real solution. Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock is the best way to unlock iPhones locked to a carrier (iOS). If you don't want to contact your carrier, Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock can open any SIM-lock. This software works with iOS 12.0 to iOS 14.8.1 on iPhone 5S to iPhone X.
