## How to Unlock SIM Card on Xiaomi 14 Pro online without jailbreak

Isn't it so frustrating when you try to change your SIM or your network, but just can't because your phone is locked under contract? Phones are our life source in this global age, it's our tether to reality, to the world! But if you have a carrier locked phone, then that connection is basically under contract by an external agency! You can't change your networks, there are limitations on how you use your phone, and when you have to travel abroad you have no option other than paying the roaming charges. If you, say, have an iPhone 5c and have these frustrations, it's likely you're already wondering how to unlock the iPhone 5c.

Chances are that if you've had a carrier locked phone for a while, you might have already forgotten what cellular freedom feels like. But we're here to remind you. All you have to do is break that carrier-lock, and you're good to go. However, you should be careful when doing so, cause if you try using a jailbreaking technique, it could have major repercussions. So we're here to give you some valuable advice about how to unlock iPhone 5, iPhone 5c, or even Android phones.

## Part 1: Unlock SIM Card on Xiaomi 14 Pro via jailbreak

Before we get into telling you how to unlock iPhone 5, or the SIM Card on iPhone or Android, we should first tell you what Jailbreaking is. You might have heard of this term before, and I'm sure it sounded ominous to you. Jailbreak? It sounds awfully close to 'Prison break.' Well, considering the carrier lock is sort of like a prison for your cell, it is an accurate terminology. But Jailbreak isn't just about breaking the carrier lock. That might happen as a by-product, but the real purpose is to break free of the software restrictions which are generally applied to Apple devices. This might seem like a good option because, well, who doesn't want to break free of all of Apple's restrictions? But that always comes at several heavy risks.

### Threats of unlocking SIM via Jailbreak

#### 1\. Not Permanent

This has got to be one of the biggest reasons for not jailbreaking your phone. It is not at all permanent! In fact, the moment you update your system, your jailbreak is lost and if you've started using a different SIM it will no longer function, and you're gonna have to go back to using that Carrier you tried so hard to escape from! It's really not worth the effort. Of course, you could stop updating altogether, but then that will bring us to…

#### 2\. Risky

If you don't update your iOS, or Mac or iPad or any device at all, in this day and age, you're basically just asking to be hacked. That is not to excuse those who do the hacking and plant malware on your system, but if you leave your front door open in a shitty neighborhood, well then you only have yourself to blame once you get robbed!

#### 3\. Warranty

Jailbreaking has now become kind-of-legal, in a very tenuous sense, but that doesn't mean Apple wholeheartedly welcomes jailbreaking. If you do so, you will never again be able to avail of the warranty on your phone. And with the kind of major bucks you have to shell out for those iPhones, you best keep that warranty intact.

#### 4\. Lack of Apps

Many top-notch and crucial app companies and organizations simply refuse to make their applications usable in jailbreak phones, as they are extremely risky and prone to hacking. As a result, you would have to rely on a bunch of non-professional apps made by amateurs, which is more likely to put your phone in harm's way.

#### 5\. Bricking

This basically means your whole system may crash and stop functioning. As a result, you're gonna' have to restore the whole thing and try to salvage whatever information you can. Now those who do jailbreak regularly will give you all kinds of excuses like it happens only rarely or that you can retrieve your data simply from the cloud, et al. But do you really want to divest all your time and energy trying to fight off malware, backing up all your data, etc, especially when there is a much more convenient option just around the corner?

Didn't think so.

Now that you know what not to do, i.e., jailbreak, we can finally tell you how to unlock iPhone 5 in a legal, safe and secure manner online, without jailbreaking. Up until a while back, one of the reasons people chose to jailbreak their phones is because the legitimate means was such a headache in which you had to contact the carrier and request a change, and even then they could refuse after several weeks of 'verification.' However, now with the slow introduction of apps that can essentially do all the work for you, within a matter of 48 hours, it really makes no sense to jailbreak. So now we'll tell you how to unlock iPhone 5c using an Online iPhone unlock tool called DoctorSIM Unlock Service.

By unlocking your phone's SIM card, you will be able to use any carrier's SIM card, giving you the freedom to choose the carrier that best suits your needs.

- **2\. Cost savings**

By unlocking your phone's SIM card, you can save money on roaming charges when traveling. Instead of paying expensive roaming charges, you can simply purchase a local SIM card and use it in your unlocked phone. This can save you a lot of money in the long run.

- **3\. Resale value**

An unlocked phone has a higher resale value than a carrier-locked phone. This is because an unlocked phone can be used with any carrier's SIM card, making it more attractive to buyers.

- **4\. No need to buy a new phone**

If you want to switch to a different carrier, you may be tempted to buy a new phone that is compatible with that carrier. However, by unlocking your phone's SIM card, you can use your existing phone with any carrier's SIM card, saving you the cost of buying a new phone.
