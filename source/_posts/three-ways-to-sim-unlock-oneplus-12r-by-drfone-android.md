You loved the OnePlus 12R device but your network provider does not have any plans that exactly suit your needs. To release your device from your current network's clutches, you will need to unlock your phone.

There are three ways you can do it and this post will go through each method so that you can find one that you are most comfortable with. Do note that if your contract has ended with your network provider, this "How to unlock OnePlus 12R" post can be skipped as you can just ask them to unlock your phone or purchase a [sim network unlock pin](https://drfone.wondershare.com/unlock/unlock-samsung-sim-network-unlock-pin.html) for a minimal price.

## Part 1: OnePlus 12R Unlock Code

This is probably the easiest, no-fuss method to [sim unlock](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/unlock-android-screen/) OnePlus 12R. Follow these steps carefully to successfully perform OnePlus 12R unlock code.

## Part 3: OnePlus 12R Unlock Carrier

If your OnePlus 12R is hard locked, this is your best bet in getting your device unlocked. Actually, it is the safest method among all three:

1. Get a new SIM card from a new carrier.
2. Call your carrier's customer service line and ask what are the requirements to qualify you to get your OnePlus 12R unlocked. If you have honored your contract, there should not be any problems. However, do ask your carrier if there are any additional requirements. Do note that there may be fees involved.
3. Once your customer service representative has determined if you have met all their requirements, they should give you the SIM network unlock PIN OnePlus 12R. Again, depending on your carrier, they might either give you the code over the phone, through email or via SMS. If you have the choice, always opt for email or SMS so that you are able to jot down the right number.
4. Once you have gotten the code, insert the new SIM card (from your new carrier). You will receive a prompt to enter your code. Make sure that you key in the right code---entering the wrong code will cause your phone to be locked (possibly forever).

## Part 5: The benefits of an unlocked OnePlus 12R

If you now know how to unlock OnePlus 12R but still do not know its advantages, we are here to help.

As indicated in the introduction, unlocked phone users can freely choose the plans they subscribed to---on any carriers, in any country. Therefore, if you travel frequently around the world, having an unlocked OnePlus 12R would be beneficial. Using a local SIM card is much cheaper than paying for exorbitant roaming charges.

You can also benefit from an unlocked OnePlus 12R if you are the kind of person who likes to take advantage of current offers provided by your local carriers. Prepaid plans are always changing in terms of offering so having the flexibility of changing carriers and prepaid plans can help you save money in the long run.

## Part 6: The downside of an unlocked OnePlus 12R

Are you thinking "Well, why can't I just buy an unlocked OnePlus 12R in the first place?" right about now? Well, you can but think of the amount of money it will cost you.

For example, in Australia, an unlocked OnePlus 12R will cost around $499 from any OnePlus outlet but $0 for the OnePlus 12R device when you pair it with a 24-month postpaid plan. While this may look attractive now, you may be paying more for a locked OnePlus 12R in the long run.

### Method 2: Retrieving the PUK Code Through Your Carrier’s Website

Here’s how it might work:

- **Step 1:** Navigate to the secure section of your account using your login credentials. For example, this is what you can see from the JIO website:

<a href="https://aspironcom.sjv.io/c/5597632/1941789/21554" target="_top" id="1941789"><img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/21554-1941789" border="0" alt="" width="650" height="800"/></a><img height="0" width="0" src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1941789/21554" style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0" />
<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![jio website](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/02/unlock-sim-without-puk-code-03.jpg)

- **Step 2:** Different carriers have varying website layouts, so refer to their specific instructions or search features to find the dedicated section for retrieving PUK codes.
- **Step 3:** Similar to contacting customer service, you might need to verify your account ownership through security questions or other verification methods.
- **Step 4:** Once verified, your PUK code should be displayed on the screen or sent to your registered email address.

Remember, these steps are general guidelines, and specific procedures may vary depending on your carrier. Consult your carrier’s website or contact customer service for the most accurate and up-to-date information.

By following these official routes, you can safely and securely bypass the PUK code hurdle and regain access to your vital mobile services. Stay tuned for Part 2, where you’ll explore alternative unlocking methods for those who prefer a different approach.

It is really irritating when you realize that OnePlus 12R phone is locked to a specific network. When you travel to another country, your phone becomes useless – you can’t use a foreign sim card. If your OnePlus 12R phone is locked to a network and want to switch to a different provider, you are out of luck.

Thankfully, there are a few easy ways to unlock your OnePlus 12R phone with free OnePlus unlock codes. In this article, we review and explain 4 different websites that offer free unlock codes for OnePlus 12R phones. Read ahead and learn how you can use four OnePlus unlock code websites.

## Part 1: SIM Unlock Service

SIM Unlock Service is one of the best and trust-worthy SIM unlock code generators available on the market. This is not a free option, but it is so effective that many users find it is worth the price. It saves you so much hassle that it is worth the small upfront fee. Doctorsim will permanently unlock your phone, enabling you to use your phone on all carriers around the world. Most importantly, using DoctorSim will not void your warranty.

## Part 2: Unlockitfree.com for free OnePlus unlock codes

Unlockitfree.com is a free remote unlock service, providing unlocking codes for OnePlus 12R phones and other models. They offer a fast and free service, but it is not always reliable.

### How to use the Unlockitfree.com Unlock Service?

1\. First, enter your phone’s unique IMEI into the site, and then the site checks to ensure that it is genuine.

2\. Choose your phone model from the list provided, and then choose your country. Once you choose your country, a list of supported Service Providers will pop up. Choose your service provider, read the terms and conditions and accept. At this point, click Generate.

3\. The Unlockitfree Generator will show you a series of 7 different unlocking codes. Not all of these will work; usually the best options are the 1st and 7th code on the list.

4\. Without removing your SIM card, input these codes into your phone’s Home screen.

Hopefully you will have success – although, this is not guaranteed (as it is with the first Dr.Fone option above).

## Part 3: FreeUnlocks for free unlock codes for OnePlus

[Unlock-Free](https://www.freeunlocks.com/) is a great option for unlocking your locked OnePlus 12R phone. The steps are quite simple and hassle free, but do keep in mind that this is a paid service. You might be able to use a free offer from TrialPay in order to get your OnePlus 12R phone unlocked for free.

### Here’s how you can use FreeUnlocks?

1\. Visit the FreeUnlocks site and locate the box asking for the phone’s model name. Insert your OnePlus model number into this box and then hit the "Unlock Phone" button.

2\. After you select this button, you will taken to a new page where you will be prompted to enter 3 different pieces of information, such as the phone's SIM's availability, your country and your phone network.

3\. Once you enter all of this information correctly, click the ‘continue’ button. This button will take you to a payment page, and you will have to pay $9.99. At this point you will be sent an unlock code, and you should be able to unlock your phone and use it anywhere in the world.
