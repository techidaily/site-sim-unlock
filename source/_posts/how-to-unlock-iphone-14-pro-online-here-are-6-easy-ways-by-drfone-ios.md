### Method 1: Contact your carrier for unlock code

When a customer signs a contract with a big cell phone company for a certain amount of time, they often get a discount on a device. Because of this, the Apple iPhone 14 Pro device comes with a controller lock so customers can only use it on their network.

You can leave without paying anything if your agreement with the company is over. You must meet the following requirements before you can unlock your Apple iPhone 14 Pro:

![sim unlock pin](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/12/how-to-unlock-iphone-11-12-4.jpg)

- First, the Apple iPhone 14 Pro device must be legal. It means the Apple iPhone 14 Pro device has not been reported as lost, stolen, or connected to a crime.
- Then you shouldn't have any debts in your bank account.
- If you signed a contract in exchange for a lower price upfront, you would have to wait until your contract ended (usually 24 months) or pay the remaining balance if you bought your phone on a payment plan.

Note: the unlocking process is different for each company.

**How to unlock the Apple iPhone 14 Pro locked by AT&T**

First, you need to know that AT&T limits how many devices a customer can unlock in a given year. Customers can unlock up to five devices per year if their account is in great condition. Visit the AT&T support page for more information about how to unlock an AT&T device and if you meet the requirements.

**AT&T Unlocking security question**

- The full name of the person whose name is on the account
- Last four digits of the account holder's social security number
- AT&T passcode of the registered account owner if they have an online account.
- The IMEI number of the Apple iPhone 14 Pro is 11/12. The serial number of the Apple iPhone 14 Pro device is called the IMEI number. You can find it on the original packaging, under the battery, and on the back of some models, by dialing #06 or navigating to Settings > General > About.

**How to unlock the Apple iPhone 14 Pro locked by T-Mobile**

T-Mobile has set several standards that should be matched to complete an unlock request.

- The device must be completely paid off, and the account must be in great condition.
- In the past 12 months, less than two SIM unlock codes for each line have been asked for.
- The device had used the T-Mobile network for at least 40 days before it was asked to be unlocked.
- If you have a service contract and have made a payment for at least 18 consecutive months, or if you paid a relocation fee. There are a few special cases that Customer Service can explain in more detail if required.
- The phone must have at least $50 worth of recharges paid for on prepaid plans.
- If you meet the above prerequisites, you can unlock an Apple iPhone 14 Pro carrier locked by a T-Mobile device by calling customer service at 611 from the Apple iPhone 14 Pro device you want to unlock.
- Make sure you have ALL of the following information on tips when you call:

1. The main account holder's phone number
2. Account Password
3. Account holder's SSN's last four digits
4. IMEI number. You can find this by navigating Settings > General > About or dialing \*#06#.

In this article we've explained how to unlock T Mobile Apple iPhone 14 Pro using DoctorSIM - SIM Unlock Service, and how to unlock T Mobile iPhone 5s using the T Mobile carrier itself. While both of them are perfectly legitimate means of unlocking your Apple iPhone 14 Pros, I personally lean more towards the DoctorSIM solution as they don't have any pesky eligibility criteria, nor do they make you wait long. They are a 100% solution, especially considering they're a third-party tool which makes them less biased as they don't have an incentive to keep you from unlocking. Well, we hope this helped and hopefully now you have a T Mobile unlock iPhone!
