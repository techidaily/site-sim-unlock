## How To Unlock Apple iPhone 6 Plus: Official Method to Unlock Your Apple iPhone 6 Plus

Restriction on the use of a SIM card by a carrier often creates a lot of problems. The barrier that you can't use another company's SIM somehow makes you feel like you're not the only owner of the phone. But you don't need to worry anymore because you are in the right place to know about the way use to unlock your Apple iPhone 6 Plus.

This article is about the official way to get your Apple iPhone 6 Plus unlocked from your carrier. But we also have a solution if you want to avoid contacting your carrier.

## Part 1: What Should You Do Before Apple iPhone 6 Plus SIM Unlock?

Before unlocking your Apple iPhone 6 Plus from the carrier, you should fulfill the following criteria.

### 1\. No Due Before Unlocking

When iPhone users sign contracts with a giant cell phone company for a certain amount of time, they often get a discount on a device. Because of this, the Apple iPhone 6 Plus device comes with a controller lock so customers can only use it on their network.

So, if you've paid off your contract or bought your Apple iPhone 6 Plus without a subsidy, it's perfectly legal to unlock it. But if you're still paying off your contract, you still need to own the Apple iPhone 6 Plus fully, so you should confirm with your carrier before unlocking it.

### 2\. You Should Buy It for More Than the Time Limit in the Contract

You can leave without paying anything if your agreement with the company is over. If you signed a contract in exchange for a lower price upfront, you would have to wait until your contract ended (usually 24 months) or pay the remaining balance if you bought your phone on a payment plan.

### Examples: Requirements of Sim Unlock of T-Mobile/EE/AT&T

T-Mobile, EE, and AT&T have common requirements before you can unlock your Apple iPhone 6 Plus.

- It has to be legal. It means the Apple iPhone 6 Plus device has not been reported as lost, stolen, or linked to a crime.
- Your bank account shouldn't have any debts.
- If you signed a contract in exchange for a lower price upfront, you would have to wait until your contract was up (usually 24 months) or pay the remaining balance if you bought your phone on a payment plan.

Apart from the requirements mentioned above, each company has its way of unlocking.

**T-Mobile**

![t mobile](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/12/unlock-iphone-x-1.jpg)

Following are the unlocking requirements of T-Mobile.

- In the past year, fewer than two SIM unlock codes have been asked for on each individual.
- The device had been connected to the T-Mobile network for at least 40 days before the request to unlock it was made.
- You have a service contract and have paid for at least 18 months in a row, or you paid a fee for moving. Customer Service can tell you more about a few special situations if you need to.
- The phone's prepaid plan must have at least $50 worth of recharges paid for.
- If you meet the above requirements, you can call customer service at 611 from the Apple iPhone 6 Plus device you want to unlock to unlock an iPhone 11 or 12 that is locked to a T-Mobile network.
- When you call about tips, make sure you have ALL of the following:

1. The main account holder's phone number
2. Account Password
3. Account holder's SSN's last four digits
4. IMEI number. You can find this by navigating Settings > General > About or dialing \*#06#.

**AT&T**

- The iPhone's IMEI number is 11/12. The IMEI number is the same thing as the serial number. You can find it on the original packaging, under the battery, or on the back of some models by dialing #06 or going to Settings > General > About.

**EE**

![ee](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/12/unlock-iphone-x-3.jpg)

Following are the unlocking requirements of EE.

- EE will only unlock pay-per-month phones after six months.
- You need to call 150 from your EE phone. If you are still under contract, you will be charged £8.99. But if your contract is up, it's free.
- EE will unlock the Apple iPhone 6 Plus immediately; there is no waiting period. If you didn't buy the phone from EE, you'd have to pay £8.99. If that's the case, there's no fee.

## All About Apple iPhone 6 Plus Unlock Chip You Need to Know

Have you purchased an iPhone from a cellular company or through a contract? So, it's clear that you aren't free to use your Apple iPhone 6 Plus.

In this article, we'll talk about the Apple iPhone 6 Plus unlock chip and special software that can remove SIM restrictions from your Apple iPhone 6 Plus. After reading this article, I hope your Apple iPhone 6 Plus's network settings will continue you from doing what you want.

## What is iPhone Unlock Chip?

iPhone unlock chip is a microchip that unlocks the iPhones and makes them able to run on any network worldwide. When you buy an iPhone, it is either locked (unable to accept carrier) or factory unlocked (can accept any carrier). These unlock chips can bypass the carrier locks in iPhones and enable locked devices to work with any SIM.

An unlock chip is an easy and cheap way to get an Apple iPhone 6 Plus to work with a different SIM card Using iPhone unlock chip enables the locked Apple iPhone 6 Plus to call and send SMS using the local network sim card, just like a factory-unlocked phone does. There have been different unlocking chips available with different names and brands, but they all do the same thing.

![unlock chip](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/12/iphone-unlock-chip-1.jpg)

### How does it work

An unlock chip is typically a slim SIM card, a memory interface chip that can be put in along with your regular SIM card. It goes on top of your Apple iPhone 6 Plus's normal SIM card and removes the network lock so you can use any sim.

![iphone unlock chip](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/12/iphone-unlock-chip-4.jpg)

The factory lock is removed quickly when an unlock chip is put into your Apple iPhone 6 Plus. An iPhone Unlock Chip fools your Apple iPhone 6 Plus into thinking it only uses a Cricket SIM card. The Apple iPhone 6 Plus Unlock Chip has the structure to fake the iPhone's IMEI number and the authentication key, which allows it to work with any GSM Service.

Putting an iPhone Unlock Chip around your regular SIM card changes how your Apple iPhone 6 Plus and SIM card talk to each other. So, the unlock chip's controller fakes the IMSI number, which allows you to use other mobile networks.

Unfortunately, many iPhone unlock chips require a jailbroken iPhone before being used. Even if your Apple iPhone 6 Plus isn't jailbroken, you can still use an iPhone unlock chip to access some of its features.

## How to Unlock SIM Card on Apple iPhone 6 Plus online without jailbreak

Isn't it so frustrating when you try to change your SIM or your network, but just can't because your phone is locked under contract? Phones are our life source in this global age, it's our tether to reality, to the world! But if you have a carrier locked phone, then that connection is basically under contract by an external agency! You can't change your networks, there are limitations on how you use your phone, and when you have to travel abroad you have no option other than paying the roaming charges. If you, say, have an iPhone 5c and have these frustrations, it's likely you're already wondering how to unlock the Apple iPhone 6 Plus 5c.

Chances are that if you've had a carrier locked phone for a while, you might have already forgotten what cellular freedom feels like. But we're here to remind you. All you have to do is break that carrier-lock, and you're good to go. However, you should be careful when doing so, cause if you try using a jailbreaking technique, it could have major repercussions. So we're here to give you some valuable advice about how to unlock iPhone 5, iPhone 5c, or even Android phones.

## Part 1: Unlock SIM Card on iPhone and Android via jailbreak

Before we get into telling you how to unlock iPhone 5, or the SIM Card on iPhone or Android, we should first tell you what Jailbreaking is. You might have heard of this term before, and I'm sure it sounded ominous to you. Jailbreak? It sounds awfully close to 'Prison break.' Well, considering the carrier lock is sort of like a prison for your cell, it is an accurate terminology. But Jailbreak isn't just about breaking the carrier lock. That might happen as a by-product, but the real purpose is to break free of the software restrictions which are generally applied to Apple devices. This might seem like a good option because, well, who doesn't want to break free of all of Apple's restrictions? But that always comes at several heavy risks.

### Threats of unlocking SIM via Jailbreak

#### 1\. Not Permanent

This has got to be one of the biggest reasons for not jailbreaking your phone. It is not at all permanent! In fact, the moment you update your system, your jailbreak is lost and if you've started using a different SIM it will no longer function, and you're gonna have to go back to using that Carrier you tried so hard to escape from! It's really not worth the effort. Of course, you could stop updating altogether, but then that will bring us to…

![Unlock SIM Card on iPhone and Android via jailbreak](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2016/10/14771444107532.jpg)

#### 2\. Risky

If you don't update your iOS, or Mac or iPad or any device at all, in this day and age, you're basically just asking to be hacked. That is not to excuse those who do the hacking and plant malware on your system, but if you leave your front door open in a shitty neighborhood, well then you only have yourself to blame once you get robbed!

#### 3\. Warranty

Jailbreaking has now become kind-of-legal, in a very tenuous sense, but that doesn't mean Apple wholeheartedly welcomes jailbreaking. If you do so, you will never again be able to avail of the warranty on your phone. And with the kind of major bucks you have to shell out for those iPhones, you best keep that warranty intact.

#### 4\. Lack of Apps

Many top-notch and crucial app companies and organizations simply refuse to make their applications usable in jailbreak phones, as they are extremely risky and prone to hacking. As a result, you would have to rely on a bunch of non-professional apps made by amateurs, which is more likely to put your phone in harm's way.

#### 5\. Bricking

This basically means your whole system may crash and stop functioning. As a result, you're gonna' have to restore the whole thing and try to salvage whatever information you can. Now those who do jailbreak regularly will give you all kinds of excuses like it happens only rarely or that you can retrieve your data simply from the cloud, et al. But do you really want to divest all your time and energy trying to fight off malware, backing up all your data, etc, especially when there is a much more convenient option just around the corner?

Didn't think so.
