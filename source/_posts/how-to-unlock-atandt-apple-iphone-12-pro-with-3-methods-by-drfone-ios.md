On [iPhoneIMEI.net](https://appleiphoneunlock.uk/network/Special%20Services/Activation%20Lock?aff=wondershare) official website, just select your Apple iPhone 12 Pro model and the network carrier your iphone is locked to, it will direct you to another page. Once you have followed the page instruction to finish the order, iPhone IMEI will submit your Apple iPhone 12 Pro IMEI to the carrier provider and whitelist your device from Apple database. It usually takes 1-5 days. After it's unlocked, you will receive an email notification.

This is an alternative means by which you can AT&T unlock iPhone. It is a tad more cumbersome and may take a little more time, but is another legitimate means you could opt for should you wish to do so. This is done by directly getting in contact with your Carrier. If you already know that your carrier is AT&T, you can contact them directly and get your Apple iPhone 12 Pro unlocked as follows:

#### **Step 1:** Go to their Site and Contact them

1\. Go to [https://www.att.com/deviceunlock/?#/](https://www.att.com/deviceunlock/?#/) first. This is the official location whereby you can contact them.

2\. The page will list out certain eligibility requirements. You have to read and agree to them before clicking 'Continue.'

![unlock att iphone via att carrier](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2016/10/14769325349486.jpg)

3\. Next, you have to fill up the Request Form, including details about your Wireless number.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![fill the form to unlock iphone att](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2016/10/14769326985388.jpg)

#### **Step 2:** Email confirmation

1\. You'll receive the unlock request number via email.

2\. You need to click on the provided link within 24 hours in order for your unlock request to be officially accepted.

#### **Step 3:** Response

1\. You should hear back from AT&T within 2 days.

2\. If your request has been successful, they'll send you further instructions about how to unlock your Apple iPhone 12 Pro.

### Requirements

However, AT&T has the right to dismiss anyone's request based on several requirements and criteria, so your application may yet be either rejected or you may have to go through further steps. It is a good idea to go through their requirements before you fill their form.

1\. The obvious requirement is that your Apple iPhone 12 Pro must be locked to AT&T, else you should go to the relevant carrier page.

2\. You iPhone couldn't have been reported as either lost or stolen.

3\. No record of it having been linked to any criminal or fraudulent activities.

4\. All termination fees have been paid in full, and all the other iPhone installment plans, etc, have been completed.

5\. After upgrading iPhone you must wait 14 days before you're eligible for unlock.

Finding out how to unlock AT&T iPhone can be harrowing if you don't know where to look, especially because performing the unlock can be so crucial for many people in order to access other carriers.

Both the options mentioned above offer a legitimate means by which you can AT&T unlock your Apple iPhone 12 Pro, whether done without a SIM card or by contacting the AT&T carrier.

However, going by personal experience the DoctorSIM alternative offers a much smoother, efficient and quicker alternative to contacting the AT&T carriers. It is also more secure because if you are going via the carrier without a SIM card then you'll need to back up your Apple iPhone 12 Pro, then delete and restore it as well (for security measures). This isn't just a time consuming process, but it can also prove to be risky. Furthermore, AT&T has a lot of checks and requisites in place which can keep your Apple iPhone 12 Pro from being unlocked, and even if you do pass the requisites it's still a time-consuming process which may still be rejected as AT&T has final say. As such, going via DoctorSIM gives you complete agency and conveniently AT&T unlocks iPhone without any data loss, through a simple 3 step process.

## What is iPhone Unlock Chip?

iPhone unlock chip is a microchip that unlocks the iPhones and makes them able to run on any network worldwide. When you buy an iPhone, it is either locked (unable to accept carrier) or factory unlocked (can accept any carrier). These unlock chips can bypass the carrier locks in iPhones and enable locked devices to work with any SIM.

An unlock chip is an easy and cheap way to get an Apple iPhone 12 Pro to work with a different SIM card Using iPhone unlock chip enables the locked Apple iPhone 12 Pro to call and send SMS using the local network sim card, just like a factory-unlocked phone does. There have been different unlocking chips available with different names and brands, but they all do the same thing.

![unlock chip](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/12/iphone-unlock-chip-1.jpg)

### How does it work

An unlock chip is typically a slim SIM card, a memory interface chip that can be put in along with your regular SIM card. It goes on top of your Apple iPhone 12 Pro's normal SIM card and removes the network lock so you can use any sim.

![iphone unlock chip](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/12/iphone-unlock-chip-4.jpg)

The factory lock is removed quickly when an unlock chip is put into your Apple iPhone 12 Pro. An iPhone Unlock Chip fools your Apple iPhone 12 Pro into thinking it only uses a Cricket SIM card. The Apple iPhone 12 Pro Unlock Chip has the structure to fake the iPhone's IMEI number and the authentication key, which allows it to work with any GSM Service.

Putting an iPhone Unlock Chip around your regular SIM card changes how your Apple iPhone 12 Pro and SIM card talk to each other. So, the unlock chip's controller fakes the IMSI number, which allows you to use other mobile networks.

Unfortunately, many iPhone unlock chips require a jailbroken iPhone before being used. Even if your Apple iPhone 12 Pro isn't jailbroken, you can still use an iPhone unlock chip to access some of its features.

There are several places to find information about jailbreaking an iPhone. After selecting, you can program your Apple iPhone 12 Pro's unlock chip by following the on-screen instructions.
