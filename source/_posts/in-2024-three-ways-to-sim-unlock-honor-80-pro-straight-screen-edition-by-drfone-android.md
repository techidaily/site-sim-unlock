You probably purchased your Honor 80 Pro Straight Screen Edition for a significant discount but are now stuck with the same network for a couple of years. You loved the Honor 80 Pro Straight Screen Edition device but your network provider does not have any plans that exactly suit your needs. To release your device from your current network's clutches, you will need to unlock your phone.
