### Q3: What is the Master Unlock Code for a Samsung?

A Master PIN code, also known as a [Samsung Unlock Code](https://drfone.wondershare.com/unlock/samsung-unlock-codes.html), is a unique numeric code that can be used to unlock a Samsung device. This code is typically provided by the manufacturer or carrier and is used to remove any restrictions or limitations on the Itel P40 device.

It is important to note that the Master PIN code is different from the Itel P40 device's regular PIN or password, and it should be kept confidential to prevent unauthorized access to the Itel P40 device.
