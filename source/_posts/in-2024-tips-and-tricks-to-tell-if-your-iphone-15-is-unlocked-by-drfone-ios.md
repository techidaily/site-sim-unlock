## How to Check iPhone SIM Lock Status?

Before you try any other solution, you should check the nature of the Lock on your Apple iPhone 15. Once you know the problem, you can move on to the right solution.

### 1\. Contact your service provider

Well, this is not a quick solution. You must contact your service provider to determine the sim lock status. Generally, you have to submit a request to the company and the IMEI number. The company will later inform you about the Sim lock status of your Apple iPhone 15 through E-mail or any other channel.

### 2\. Check it via "Carrier Lock" in "Settings."

Navigate to Settings > General > About.

![carrier lock](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/12/unlock-iphone-online-7.jpg)

Apple has added a new Network Provider Lock section to iOS 14 that immediately tells you the Apple iPhone 15 device's status.

Scroll down to find the section called "Network Provider Lock." If the Apple iPhone 15 is unlocked, it should say "No SIM restrictions" on the screen. If you see something different, it means the Apple iPhone 15 is locked.

### 3\. Check it via your IMEI code

If you know the IMEI number of your Apple iPhone 15, you can get one of those online IMEI-checking tools to see if the phone it belongs to is locked. Most of these services ask for money, which is a problem but generally, they ask for a very minimal amount.

### Conclusion

So, these were the ways to unlock your Apple iPhone 15 online. Knowing about online unlocking services, you must have realized that you should trust them sparingly. Instead, you should go for a real solution. Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock is the best way to unlock iPhones locked to a carrier (iOS). If you don't want to contact your carrier, Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock can open any SIM-lock. This software works with iOS 12.0 to iOS 14.8.1 on iPhone 5S to iPhone X.
