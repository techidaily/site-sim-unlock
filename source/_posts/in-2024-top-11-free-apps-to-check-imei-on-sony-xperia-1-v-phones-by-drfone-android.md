## Part 5: The benefits of an unlocked Sony Xperia 1 V

If you now know how to unlock Sony Xperia 1 V but still do not know its advantages, we are here to help.

As indicated in the introduction, unlocked phone users can freely choose the plans they subscribed to---on any carriers, in any country. Therefore, if you travel frequently around the world, having an unlocked Sony Xperia 1 V would be beneficial. Using a local SIM card is much cheaper than paying for exorbitant roaming charges.

You can also benefit from an unlocked Sony Xperia 1 V if you are the kind of person who likes to take advantage of current offers provided by your local carriers. Prepaid plans are always changing in terms of offering so having the flexibility of changing carriers and prepaid plans can help you save money in the long run.

## Part 6: The downside of an unlocked Sony Xperia 1 V

Are you thinking "Well, why can't I just buy an unlocked Sony Xperia 1 V in the first place?" right about now? Well, you can but think of the amount of money it will cost you.

For example, in Australia, an unlocked Sony Xperia 1 V will cost around $499 from any Sony outlet but $0 for the Sony Xperia 1 V device when you pair it with a 24-month postpaid plan. While this may look attractive now, you may be paying more for a locked Sony Xperia 1 V in the long run.

## Conclusion

Now that you know the three ways of unlocking your Sony Xperia 1 V, all you need to do is find one that is most compatible with you. Just remember to think of everything through and carefully. Most importantly, if you have a locked device, always seek advice from your carrier to see if this is possible.
