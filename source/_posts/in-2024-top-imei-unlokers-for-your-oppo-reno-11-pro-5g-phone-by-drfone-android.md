If your Oppo Reno 11 Pro 5G is hard locked, this is your best bet in getting your device unlocked. Actually, it is the safest method among all three:

1. Get a new SIM card from a new carrier.
2. Call your carrier's customer service line and ask what are the requirements to qualify you to get your Oppo Reno 11 Pro 5G unlocked. If you have honored your contract, there should not be any problems. However, do ask your carrier if there are any additional requirements. Do note that there may be fees involved.

## Part 6: The downside of an unlocked Oppo Reno 11 Pro 5G

Are you thinking "Well, why can't I just buy an unlocked Oppo Reno 11 Pro 5G in the first place?" right about now? Well, you can but think of the amount of money it will cost you.

For example, in Australia, an unlocked Oppo Reno 11 Pro 5G will cost around $499 from any Oppo outlet but $0 for the Oppo Reno 11 Pro 5G device when you pair it with a 24-month postpaid plan. While this may look attractive now, you may be paying more for a locked Oppo Reno 11 Pro 5G in the long run.
