## Ways To Find Unlocking Codes For Itel S23 Phones

When you have a locked device, it is pretty much impossible to move from one network to another. This would cause problems if for instance you wanted to travel outside the country and want to switch to that country's carrier for the duration of your stay. Or maybe you just want to switch carriers because you don't like your current provider.

Whatever the reason, you should be able to unlock your device easily. But this has often proven difficult because of the fact that you need unlock codes. The problem is that many sites promise free unlocking codes for your device and many turn out to be fraudulent sites that use the word "free" in their advertising but actually require you to pay for the service. If you have been unsuccessfully searching for free unlocking codes for your device, look no further. This article compiles three of the best for Android and iPhone.

## Part 1: 3 Ways to Find Unlocking Codes for Android Devices

## Part 3: Popular Youtube Video for Unlocking Your Itel S23

Here we've found a popular video on Youtube for you to follow and sim unlock your phone.

<iframe width="800" height="450" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/393YR8Hum5g" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0"></iframe>

It is very important to note that by unlocking your device you are breaching the contract you have with your service provider. Also, note that if the codes fail to work the first 4 times don't try to enter a fifth time as this will generally disable your device. This will mean that you will be unable to use the Itel S23 device. Proceed with caution.

## Part 1: Asking the Carrier to Unlock

One of the best options is getting in touch with the carrier and asking them to unlock the SIM locked phone. For that to happen, it is important to first know whether the phone is SIM locked and then whether the phone can be unlocked and if you are eligible to unlock the phone. There is an eligibility clause in contract for Smartphones bought on contract and if a specific time period is not up yet, then a termination fee is required to be paid by the user to break the contract in order to be able to use any SIM on the Itel S23 device after getting the unlock code.

**_Pros_**

• This is the best way to unlock carrier locked devices.

• This is legal and everything happens based on the clause mentioned in the contract.

**_Cons  
_**

• Sometimes, even the network providers or carrier refuse to unlock Smartphone

• There is a certain time period which if not over yet, unlocking the phone would require termination fee.

## Part 2: Professional Reputable Smartphone Unlock Service

If you have tried out contacting the carrier and there is no way the carrier is unlocking your phone, you can opt for professional unlock service which could be of help. But finding such a professional service is not an easy task. There are some sites and service providers which require the IMEI number of the phone to create unlock codes. IMEI number of the phone is given to the professional SIM unlock service post which, they generate a special character combination which can be used to get the cell phone out of network restrictions. So, the phone can be unlocked remotely by using the special remote unlock codes.

Sometimes, the professional Smartphone service providers even ask for the phone to be sent to them to get the phone unlocked.

**_Pros_**

• This method could be opted as a last resort if there is no help from the carrier.

• Professional and reputable Smartphone unlock service providers tend to serve the purpose as they are specialized in this task.

• There are not many obligations involved.

**_Cons  
_**

• This might attract legal actions against the user.

• It is very difficult to find such professional Smartphone unlock service providers.

• Reliability on such service providers is also another factor which requires attention.
