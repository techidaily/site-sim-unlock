![sim unlock iphone with iphoneimei.net](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2016/06/14670574228916.jpg)

On [iPhoneIMEI.net](https://appleiphoneunlock.uk/network/Special%20Services/Activation%20Lock?aff=wondershare) official website, just select your Apple iPhone 15 model and the network carrier your iphone is locked to, it will direct you to another page. Once you have followed the page instruction to finish the order, iPhone IMEI will submit your Apple iPhone 15 IMEI to the carrier provider and whitelist your device from Apple database.

This is an alternative means by which you can AT&T unlock iPhone. It is a tad more cumbersome and may take a little more time, but is another legitimate means you could opt for should you wish to do so. This is done by directly getting in contact with your Carrier. If you already know that your carrier is AT&T, you can contact them directly and get your Apple iPhone 15 unlocked as follows:

#### **Step 1:** Go to their Site and Contact them

1\. Go to [https://www.att.com/deviceunlock/?#/](https://www.att.com/deviceunlock/?#/) first. This is the official location whereby you can contact them.

2\. The page will list out certain eligibility requirements. You have to read and agree to them before clicking 'Continue.'

![unlock att iphone via att carrier](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2016/10/14769325349486.jpg)

### Requirements

However, AT&T has the right to dismiss anyone's request based on several requirements and criteria, so your application may yet be either rejected or you may have to go through further steps. It is a good idea to go through their requirements before you fill their form.

1\. The obvious requirement is that your Apple iPhone 15 must be locked to AT&T, else you should go to the relevant carrier page.

Both the options mentioned above offer a legitimate means by which you can AT&T unlock your Apple iPhone 15, whether done without a SIM card or by contacting the AT&T carrier.

However, going by personal experience the DoctorSIM alternative offers a much smoother, efficient and quicker alternative to contacting the AT&T carriers. It is also more secure because if you are going via the carrier without a SIM card then you'll need to back up your Apple iPhone 15, then delete and restore it as well (for security measures).

Furthermore, AT&T has a lot of checks and requisites in place which can keep your Apple iPhone 15 from being unlocked, and even if you do pass the requisites it's still a time-consuming process which may still be rejected as AT&T has final say.
