## Top 3 Sites to Find Free Tecno Unlock Codes to Unlock Your Tecno Phone

[![Selena Lee](https://drfone.wondershare.com/images/selena-lee.png)](https://drfone.wondershare.com/author/selena-lee/)

It is really irritating when you realize that Tecno Spark 20 phone is locked to a specific network. When you travel to another country, your phone becomes useless – you can’t use a foreign sim card. If your Tecno Spark 20 phone is locked to a network and want to switch to a different provider, you are out of luck.

Thankfully, there are a few easy ways to unlock your Tecno Spark 20 phone with free Tecno unlock codes. In this article, we review and explain 4 different websites that offer free unlock codes for Tecno Spark 20 phones. Read ahead and learn how you can use four Tecno unlock code websites.

## Part 1: SIM Unlock Service

SIM Unlock Service is one of the best and trust-worthy SIM unlock code generators available on the market. This is not a free option, but it is so effective that many users find it is worth the price. It saves you so much hassle that it is worth the small upfront fee. Doctorsim will permanently unlock your phone, enabling you to use your phone on all carriers around the world. Most importantly, using DoctorSim will not void your warranty.

### How to use DoctorSim SIM Unlock Service to unlock Tecno Spark 20 phones?

Step 1. Go to [DoctorSim's official website](https://www.doctorsim.com/libtrkafl.html?pc=43d47c30d945bcbd7d9527f4049f649a&refe=https://www.doctorsim.com/us-en/?scp&euro), so you know that you can trust it. Click on the ‘Select Your Tecno Spark 20’ button, and then select Tecno from the list of brands.

Step 2. Fill in your phone’s information and your contact details in the following window, including the phone IMEI, phone model, and your email. Once your order is processed, the system will send you your personalized unlock code and unlocking instructions. You can then follow the instructions to unlock your Tecno Spark 20 phone. Easy!

## Part 2: Unlockitfree.com for free Tecno unlock codes

Unlockitfree.com is a free remote unlock service, providing unlocking codes for Tecno Spark 20 phones and other models. They offer a fast and free service, but it is not always reliable.

### How to use the Unlockitfree.com Unlock Service?

1\. First, enter your phone’s unique IMEI into the site, and then the site checks to ensure that it is genuine.

2\. Choose your phone model from the list provided, and then choose your country. Once you choose your country, a list of supported Service Providers will pop up. Choose your service provider, read the terms and conditions and accept. At this point, click Generate.

3\. The Unlockitfree Generator will show you a series of 7 different unlocking codes. Not all of these will work; usually the best options are the 1st and 7th code on the list.

4\. Without removing your SIM card, input these codes into your phone’s Home screen.

Hopefully you will have success – although, this is not guaranteed (as it is with the first Dr.Fone option above).

## Part 3: FreeUnlocks for free unlock codes for Tecno

[Unlock-Free](https://www.freeunlocks.com/) is a great option for unlocking your locked Tecno Spark 20 phone. The steps are quite simple and hassle free, but do keep in mind that this is a paid service.
