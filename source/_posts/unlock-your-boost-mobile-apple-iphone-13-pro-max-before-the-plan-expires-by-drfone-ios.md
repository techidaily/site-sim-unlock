### Using a second-hand device having a locked carrier

If you have bought a second-hand device having the locked carrier or paid monthly contracts, you would need to first need to unlock the Apple iPhone 13 Pro Max device to use it.

Step 3. You need to input the provided code and your device will be unlocked.

Note: For the BoostUP! For installment plan holders, the **Boost Mobile unlock Sim card** process will be done in a day while for the others it might take around 2 days.

A few points that need to be taken care of during the unlocking process are as follows:

- Ensure that your SIM card is in your phone else if you replace or remove the SIM card, your unlocking request might fail.
- Also, make sure that your device during the phase is turned on and is also connected with the Boost Mobile Network or to a WiFi network.

Unlocking phones for the Non-Boost Customers

If you are currently not a Boost customer and have been a customer earlier or have never been a customer and have purchased from a previous owner, you can still get your phone unlocked, though the process becomes a little complicated and the following are the requirements.

- You would need a Boost mobile number or an account number that was last associated with the Apple iPhone 13 Pro Max device.
- In case you do not have the number, then you will have to get in touch with the previous owner and get these details.

And in case you do not meet either of the above two situations, **Boost mobile carrier unlock** on your device cannot be done and you will first need to use the Boost network for the required time and get yourself eligible for the unlocking process.

_**Tip**: Another important point to consider before buying a device from a third party is to check with the Boost Mobile if the phone is unlocked or if it is eligible. In case you come to know that your device cannot be unlocked, you will not have to worry about the eligibility criteria or requirements._

## The Ultimate Guide to Unlocking Your Apple iPhone 13 Pro Max on MetroPCS

If you own an iPhone that is MetroPCS-branded, the carrier will probably lock it, making it impossible to use a SIM from another carrier on the Apple iPhone 13 Pro Max device. Therefore, you will have to unlock iPhone MetroPCS for this purpose.

Many people find it difficult to unlock their MetroPCS iPhone and resort to buying a new phone altogether to use it with another service provider. In this article, you will learn how to use the MetroPCS unlock phones feature with three different methods. So, let’s get started!

### 1\. Calling MetroPCS to Unlock Phones

The first and most straightforward method to carrier unlocks MetroPCS phone is to call the company. But before you do that, make sure whether your phone has GSM/LTE or CDMA technology. Check for the small slot on the side of your phone to see whether there’s a SIM.

If your phone does not have a SIM, it uses CDMA technology. You will have to call your new carrier company and request them to unlock your phone in such a case. However, if you find a SIM card, your phone works on GSM or LTE and can easily be unlocked by contacting MetroPCS customer care.

Here’s how to do that:

**Step 1**

Call 1-888-863-8768 to reach the MetroPCS customer service, and request a MetroPCS network unlock code.

**Step 2**

They might ask you to provide your phone number, name on the MetroPCS account, email address, and PIN. Therefore, keep this information at hand.

**Step 3**

They will send you a confirmation email within 2 to 3 business days, containing the MetroPCS unlock code and instructions on how to use it.

**Step 4**

The instructions involve turning off your phone, inserting the SIM card of the new carrier, and entering the provided code when prompted. And that’s how you unlock your MetroPCS phone for free via the official method.

The downside of this method is again the time consumption. You have to call and wait for your turn, answer a bunch of questions, and wait for several days before receiving a confirmation email. If you want to save all this time, you can unlock iPhone MetroPCS for free using a more time-efficient method, i.e., using an unlock tool like [Dr.Fone – Sim Unlock](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/iphone-unlock/).

## What are the prerequisites for an Apple iPhone 13 Pro Max SIM lock?

To prevent theft and other types of fraud, Verizon locks new devices to only work on the Verizon network. The company has different rules for unlocking prepaid and post-pay devices, as well as special rules for people in the military who are distributed.

"Unlocking" a device means turning off Software that would stop a customer from trying to use a device made for one carrier's network on another carrier's network. Due to different technologies, a Verizon Wireless device that has been unlocked may only work partially on another carrier's network.

![verizon](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/12/unlock-iphone-se-4.jpg)

**Verizon's Policy for unlocking Post-pay devices**

If you buy a phone from Verizon, it will be locked for 60 days after you buy it. If you buy a device from one of their authorized retailers, it will be locked for 60 days after it is activated.

After 60 days, the lock will be taken off itself unless the Apple iPhone 13 Pro Max device is found to be stolen or was bought through fraud. After 60 days, their phones are never locked again.

**Unlocking Verizon's Prepaid Device**

After activation, devices you buy from Verizon and some devices you buy from one of their authorized retailers are locked for 60 days. After 60 days, the lock will be taken off itself unless the Apple iPhone 13 Pro Max device is found to be stolen or was bought through fraud. After the first 60 days, their phones are locked, but after that, they never lock them again.

**Military Personnel Placement Unlocking Policy**

If you are in the military and a Verizon Wireless customer, in case, you get orders to move outside of the Verizon Coverage Area. The company will unlock your device and stop your service if you ask, even if it has only been 60 days since you bought it.
