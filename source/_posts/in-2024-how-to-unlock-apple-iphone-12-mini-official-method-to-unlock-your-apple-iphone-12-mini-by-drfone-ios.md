## Part 1: What Should You Do Before Apple iPhone 12 mini SIM Unlock?

Before unlocking your Apple iPhone 12 mini from the carrier, you should fulfill the following criteria.

### 1\. No Due Before Unlocking

When iPhone users sign contracts with a giant cell phone company for a certain amount of time, they often get a discount on a device. Because of this, the Apple iPhone 12 mini device comes with a controller lock so customers can only use it on their network.

So, if you've paid off your contract or bought your Apple iPhone 12 mini without a subsidy, it's perfectly legal to unlock it. But if you're still paying off your contract, you still need to own the Apple iPhone 12 mini fully, so you should confirm with your carrier before unlocking it.

### 2\. You Should Buy It for More Than the Time Limit in the Contract

You can leave without paying anything if your agreement with the company is over. If you signed a contract in exchange for a lower price upfront, you would have to wait until your contract ended (usually 24 months) or pay the remaining balance if you bought your phone on a payment plan.

### Examples: Requirements of Sim Unlock of T-Mobile/EE/AT&T

T-Mobile, EE, and AT&T have common requirements before you can unlock your Apple iPhone 12 mini.

- It has to be legal. It means the Apple iPhone 12 mini device has not been reported as lost, stolen, or linked to a crime.
- Your bank account shouldn't have any debts.
- If you signed a contract in exchange for a lower price upfront, you would have to wait until your contract was up (usually 24 months) or pay the remaining balance if you bought your phone on a payment plan.

Apart from the requirements mentioned above, each company has its way of unlocking.

**T-Mobile**

- If you meet the above requirements, you can call customer service at 611 from the Apple iPhone 12 mini device you want to unlock to unlock an iPhone 11 or 12 that is locked to a T-Mobile network.
- When you call about tips, make sure you have ALL of the following:

1. The main account holder's phone number

This can be a problem when you want to change carriers. Some iPhones are generally easier to unlock than others, and the easiest way to unlock any iPhone is usually to use a paid online service. The issue is that these services can be very expensive.

In this article, we are going to look at how you can [sim unlock](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/unlock-android-screen/) your Apple iPhone 12 mini. It is however important to note that if you purchased your device in the last one year, it is already unlocked.

Many people may wonder whether it is legal to unlock the iPhone. Actually, it is perfectly legal to unlock your Apple iPhone 12 mini if you have completed payments on the contract, or you bought the Apple iPhone 12 mini device outright. If however, you are still in the process of paying for your contract, you don't fully own the phone and so you should contact the carrier before unlocking it.

But if your Apple iPhone 12 mini has [bad ESN](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/iphone-unlock/) or been blacklisted by the carrier, you can check the new post here to check what to do if you have a [blacklisted iPhone](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/iphone-unlock/).

##  Part 1: How to SIM Unlock Your Apple iPhone 12 mini?

There are several ways to unlock your device. Let's look at a few of them.

### 1\. Contact your Carrier and Have them unlock the Apple iPhone 12 mini device for you

This is probably the safest way to do it. If you have already completed payments on your Apple iPhone 12 mini or you bought it outright, you can ask your carrier for the [sim network unlock pin](https://drfone.wondershare.com/unlock/unlock-samsung-sim-network-unlock-pin.html) to unlock your device. Depending on your carrier, you may have to pay for this service, and it also does take up to 7 days, sometimes more for them to get back to you.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### 2\. Software Unlocking

This is where you download a piece of [sim network unlock pin software](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/unlock-android-screen/) on to your device. This software makes changes to the Apple iPhone 12 mini device, allowing you to make calls from any carrier. While this may sound straight-forward and easy, except it is highly risky and will not work for iPhone 4 and later models.

### 3\. Hardware Unlocking

This is where you alter the hardware of the Apple iPhone 12 mini device to create an alternate path to deliver calls. Although this can be done, it also alters your device irreparably and probably also voids your warranty. Not to mention, you may pay more than $200 to have the Apple iPhone 12 mini device unlocked in this way.

This method uses your device's IMEI number to access the IMEI database and change the status of the Apple iPhone 12 mini from locked to unlocked. There are very many services that you can use to IMEI unlock your device, and most of them will offer the service for a fee. But this is a great solution because there is no software to download, and you don't mess with the hardware in any way.

### Steps on How to Unlock Your Apple iPhone 12 mini via IMEI

Like we mentioned before, there are a lot of services you can use to unlock your Apple iPhone 12 mini. One of the best is [iPhoneIMEI.net](https://appleiphoneunlock.uk/network/Special%20Services/Activation%20Lock?aff=wondershare).

If you want to remove the carrier lock from your Apple iPhone 12 mini, request **Cricket customer support for the network unlock code for free**. They’ll give it to you if they have it or can get it from the manufacturer. But first, make sure you meet the unlock requirements. The process depends on various factors, including your account status and the phone’s activation period.

If you are wondering whether there are other ways to do it aside from reaching out to their customer support, read on.

Different Ways To Unlock Cricket iPhone

Here’s an overview of the options available:

Cricket Network Unlock Code Free From Cricket Wireless

It is the most straightforward approach, but it comes with some restrictions. You must meet Cricket’s unlock policy requirements. If you fulfill these conditions, you can request a **Cricket unlock code for free** online.

Early Unlocking for Military Personnel

Good news if you’re in the military. You can ask their customer support to unlock your Apple iPhone 12 mini, even if you haven’t used the service for six months. Having a **Cricket device unlocked** earlier is a way to help you stay connected during deployments.

Third-Party iPhone Unlocking Tools

Not all devices can be unlocked by Cricket if you don’t qualify for their requirements. However, paid online services and third-party apps can open up your options. These tools can help you use your phone on any compatible carrier, even if you don’t meet **Cricket device unlock** requirements.

While this option can be faster, choosing a reputable service provider and understanding the associated risks is crucial. Ensure it is legal in your region and won’t harm your phone’s functionality.

Ready to **unlock Cricket iPhone**? But wait, are you sure you meet the eligibility criteria? Let’s find out in the next section.
