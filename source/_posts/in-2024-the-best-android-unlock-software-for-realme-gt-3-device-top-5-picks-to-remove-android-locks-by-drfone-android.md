You need to unlock it first, because you will get a message: "This iPhone is locked and cannot be used with another carrier."

Aside from just allowing you to check whether the IMEI number provided is valid, [IMEI Analyzer](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.vndnguyen.imeianalyze&hl=en) will also provide you with data about your device based on the IMEI (International Mobile Equipment Identity) number . It also has an additional feature that calculates the IMEI number when you enter only 15 digits. It also analyses the IMEI number providing you with different information about the number itself such as the Serial Number (SNR), Type Allocation Code (TAC), Reporting body identifier, Final Assembly Code, and Check Digit.

By using an IMEI Analyzer, users can validate the IMEI number, check if the Realme GT 3 device is blacklisted or stolen, and obtain information about the Realme GT 3 device's brand, model, and specifications. This can be particularly useful when buying a used mobile device or trying to recover a lost or stolen one. Some IMEI analyzers may also provide additional features such as warranty status checks, carrier information, and SIM lock status.
