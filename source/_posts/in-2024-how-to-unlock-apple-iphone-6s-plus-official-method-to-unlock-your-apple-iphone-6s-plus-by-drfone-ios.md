### 1\. No Due Before Unlocking

When iPhone users sign contracts with a giant cell phone company for a certain amount of time, they often get a discount on a device. Because of this, the Apple iPhone 6s Plus device comes with a controller lock so customers can only use it on their network.

So, if you've paid off your contract or bought your Apple iPhone 6s Plus without a subsidy, it's perfectly legal to unlock it. But if you're still paying off your contract, you still need to own the Apple iPhone 6s Plus fully, so you should confirm with your carrier before unlocking it.

### 2\. You Should Buy It for More Than the Time Limit in the Contract

You can leave without paying anything if your agreement with the company is over. If you signed a contract in exchange for a lower price upfront, you would have to wait until your contract ended (usually 24 months) or pay the remaining balance if you bought your phone on a payment plan.

## Method 3: Using Online Unlockers To Unlock Telstra iPhones

While venturing into the online realm, you might encounter websites offering remote unlocking services for a fee. These services claim to **unlock your Telstra phone** quickly and conveniently, often without contacting the carrier. However, approaching this method requires extreme caution due to potential risks and legal implications.

Before diving in:

- **Understand the risks.**Online unlocking services operate in a gray area, potentially violating your carrier’s terms and conditions. This could lead to legal trouble or void your phone’s warranty.
- **Beware of scams.**Unfortunately, not all online unlocking services are legitimate. Many are scams designed to steal your money or personal information.
- **Do your research.**If you choose to proceed, thoroughly research the service provider. Read reviews from other users, check their track record, and ensure they have a good reputation.

These services typically require you to provide your phone’s IMEI number and pay a fee. They then claim to use various methods, often software or network vulnerabilities, to unlock your phone remotely. However, the success rate and security of these methods are highly questionable. Thus, relying on Dr.Fone as an alternative unlocking method is recommended.
