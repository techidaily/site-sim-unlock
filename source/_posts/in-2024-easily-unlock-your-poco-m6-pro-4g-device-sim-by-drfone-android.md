## How To Change Your SIM PIN Code on Your Poco M6 Pro 4G Phone

When you get a new SIM card, it usually comes with a default PIN (Personal Identity Number) code printed on the packaging, documentation, or back of the SIM card. This 4-digit code protects your phone number from unauthorized calls, texts, and data use. It’s essential to change the default PIN to one that’s both memorable for you and difficult for others to guess.

So, **how to change the PIN on an Android phone**’s SIM card? This article will provide a step-by-step guide to help you secure your data. But first, let’s explore why changing the default one is important.

![a phone sim card](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/02/how-to-change-pin-on-android-phone-01.jpg)

## Part 1: Why Does Changing Your SIM PIN Code Matter on a New Phone?

Your SIM PIN code acts as a password for your SIM card, which stores your phone number, contacts, and other essential data. Unlike the PIN you use to unlock your phone, the SIM PIN code is a separate layer of security. If someone tries to use your SIM card in another phone without the correct PIN, they won’t be able to access your network or data.

Here are more reasons why **changing the PIN code of a SIM card** is a smart move:

- Default PINs are easy to guess

Most carriers use generic PINs like “1234” or “0000”. Change it to something unique and harder to crack.

- Protects data in case of loss or theft

If you lose your phone or it gets stolen, a strong PIN code hinders the thief’s ability to make calls, send messages, or access your data stored on the SIM. It buys you time to report the loss and block your SIM card before they can do any damage.

![sim card locked](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/02/how-to-change-pin-on-android-phone-02.jpg)

- Prevents accidental PIN lockouts

Using a memorable PIN minimizes the risk of accidentally locking yourself out of your SIM card.

- Peace of mind

It is crucial if you store sensitive info on your SIM or use your phone for work. Knowing about this extra safeguard is reassuring, ensuring your data stays protected.

**Remember:**

Choose a PIN code for your SIM that’s easy for you to remember but challenging for others to guess. Avoid using birthdays, anniversaries, or other easily identifiable information. By taking a few minutes to **change the PIN code of the SIM card**, you’ll gain a significant security advantage for your new phone and data.

## Part 2: How To Change Pin on Android Phone SIM Cards?

Keeping your SIM card secure is crucial for protecting your data and privacy. Thankfully, Android allows you to easily change your SIM card PIN to a more personal and memorable code. But before you begin:

- Contact your network carrier to get your PUK code if you already have it. You’ll need this if you enter the wrong PIN three times and lock your SIM card.
- Remember the temporary default PIN: Most SIM cards have a default PIN, often 1234 or 0123. If you haven’t changed it, this is the PIN you’ll use initially.

**Note:**

Entering the wrong PIN three times will lock your SIM card. You’ll need your network carrier’s PUK code to unlock it. Use it cautiously, as exceeding the maximum number of attempts will permanently block your SIM card. So, it’s best to memorize your PIN or store it securely to avoid relying on the PUK altogether.

Steps To Change Your SIM PIN

Here’s **how to find and manage the SIM PIN code on Android**:

- **Step 1:** Navigate to your phone’s **Settings** app. Next, look for the **Security and privacy** or **Lock screen and security** (or other similar option) depending on your device’s model.
- **Step 2:** Scroll down and tap on **More security settings** or **Other security settings**.
- **Step 3:** Tap **SIM card security** or **Set up SIM card lock** (or something similar).

![sim card security in settings](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/02/how-to-change-pin-on-android-phone-03.jpg)

- **Step 4:** If you have multiple SIMs, select the one you want to change the PIN code.
- **Step 5:** Tap **Change SIM PIN**.

![change sim pin code on android](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/02/how-to-change-pin-on-android-phone-04.jpg)

- **Step 6:** Input your current SIM card PIN code and tap **OK**.

- **Step 7:** Enter your desired new PIN code and tap **OK**.
- **Step 8:** Re-enter your new SIM card PIN code and tap **OK** to confirm.

Success! You’ve successfully **changed the PIN code of your SIM card**. Remember your new PIN for future use.

## Part 3: What To Do if You Forgot or Lost an iOS Device’s SIM PIN Code?

If you’re an Android user, changing your SIM PIN is easy. But for iPhone users, forgetting it can lock you out. So, what should you do if you **lose the SIM PIN** code on iOS?

First, avoid guessing your SIM PIN or PUK code. Every wrong guess increases the risk of permanently locking your SIM card, requiring a replacement. If you forget your PIN, contact your network carrier for help. They can usually unlock your SIM with the default PIN or PUK code. If that fails, you can request a new SIM card.

However, there might also be situations where you’re locked out due to a carrier-restricted SIM card. If a quick resolution is important or you want to keep your current SIM card, consider using [Wondershare Dr.Fone](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/drfone-toolkit/).

## Tutorial to Change Poco M6 Pro 4G IMEI without Root: A Comprehensive Guide

As an Android device user, you may have come across a situation where you need to change your device IMEI number. The International Mobile Equipment Identity (IMEI) is a unique 15-digit number assigned to every mobile device, such as smartphones and tablets. This number serves as an identifier, helping to distinguish your device from millions of others. One of the main reasons people want to change their Android IMEI number is to unblock a device that has been blacklisted by their network provider. Other reasons include accessing certain network features and services or maintaining anonymity.

Changing your Android IMEI without root access may seem like a daunting task, but this comprehensive guide will walk you through the process step-by-step. Before proceeding, please note that altering your device's IMEI number can be illegal in some countries, and may void your warranty. Proceed with caution and at your own risk. Get to know **how to change IMEI number** now!

## Part 1: What is IMEI and Why People Change The IMEI Number

The International Mobile Equipment Identity (IMEI) is a unique identifier for every mobile device. It allows network providers and manufacturers to track and block devices if they are reported as lost or stolen. Changing your device's IMEI can help to unblock a blacklisted device, access certain network features and services, or maintain anonymity. However, be aware that altering your IMEI number is illegal in some countries and may void your warranty.

![imei number](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/05/imei-number.jpg)

### There are several uses of the IMEI number

1. As the use of mobile devices increases, the statistics of stolen and lost devices have been increasing as well. Users can block stolen or lost devices for further usage if they know their IMEI number. All users need to call their network carrier and report that the Poco M6 Pro 4G device is stolen or lost. The carrier can block the specific device from running on their network and notify other carriers.
2. The 15-digit IMEI number indicates the origin and model of the Poco M6 Pro 4G device. The first eight digits indicate the Poco M6 Pro 4G device's origin and its model while the last six digits identify the Poco M6 Pro 4G device's manufacturer.
3. If you subscribe to a mobile tracking service, you can use the IMEI number to track the Poco M6 Pro 4G device---even if it uses a different SIM card.

### Pros and Cons of Changing Android IMEI

Like many other things out there, changing Android IMEI has both advantages and disadvantages. Here are some of them:

**Advantages**

1. Make your Android untraceable. By constantly changing your IMEI, you will throw off the tracks of people using it to stalk you!
2. Fix any invalid IMEI-related issues such as lost or invalid IMEI numbers. Once you change your IMEI, your Android device with the same benefits and features.
3. Obtaining a completely new device ID.
4. Changing the IMEI number to one that indicates it is a newer model, you will be able to enjoy new OS updates by resetting, repairing, and updating your Android device.
5. Have you ever yearned for that cheap BlackBerry plan your network carrier keeps on promoting? The 15-digit IMEI indicates the origin and model of your device. Therefore, by changing your Android's IMEI number to that of a BlackBerry's, you will be able to subscribe to a cheaper mobile plan.

**Disadvantages**

1. Before we begin, we need to make it clear that the process of changing IMEI without root can be illegal in some countries. We advise you to check the laws and regulations in your country before attempting to change your device’s IMEI number. As far as we know, it is legal in Africa and Asia, and illegal in Europe.
2. The IMEI number is hardcoded into your device. Therefore, changing your device’s IMEI number may void your device warranty and cause other issues such as network problems and software instability.
3. Legally, you have forfeited your ownership of your mobile device. When you purchase your device, the seller will jot down the original IMEI number on your receipt. So if you changed your IMEI and lost it, you may not be able to claim it. This is because authorities cannot see if it is truly yours. After all, the IMEI numbers no longer correlate with each other.

### Method 4: Find IMEI on a Removable Battery (for older devices)

## Part 3: Does IMEI Change With SIM Card?

No, swapping or changing the SIM card does not alter the IMEI (International Mobile Equipment Identity). The IMEI persists unchanged throughout the Poco M6 Pro 4G device's lifetime, functioning as a distinctive identifier solely for that particular device.

The IMEI is a 15-digit code assigned to each mobile device. It's separate from the SIM card, which stores information related to the subscriber and the carrier network. The SIM card contains data specific to the subscriber. This includes contacts, text messages, and network-related information. But it does not alter or affect the IMEI of the Poco M6 Pro 4G device.

The IMEI remains the same even if you change SIM cards or switch between different carriers. It's essentially a static identifier tied to the Poco M6 Pro 4G device's hardware. It is used by mobile networks and authorities to identify and track devices on the network.

## Part 4: Does IMEI Change After Factory Reset?

No, performing a factory reset on your mobile device does not change its IMEI (International Mobile Equipment Identity). The IMEI is a unique identifier assigned to the hardware of the Poco M6 Pro 4G device. It remains constant throughout the life of the Poco M6 Pro 4G device, irrespective of any software changes or resets.

A factory reset wipes the data and settings on your device, returning it to its original factory state. This process erases user-installed apps, personal data, and settings. But it doesn’t affect the Poco M6 Pro 4G device's hardware identification, including the IMEI.

The IMEI is embedded into the hardware of the Poco M6 Pro 4G device. It is typically printed on the Poco M6 Pro 4G device's packaging or can be found by dialing \*#06# on the phone's keypad. It's a crucial identifier for mobile networks, and authorities use it to uniquely identify and track devices across networks. It remains unchanged even after a factory reset.
