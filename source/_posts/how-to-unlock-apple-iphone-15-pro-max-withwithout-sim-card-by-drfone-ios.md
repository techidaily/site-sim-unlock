## What is iPhone Unlock Chip?

iPhone unlock chip is a microchip that unlocks the iPhones and makes them able to run on any network worldwide. When you buy an iPhone, it is either locked (unable to accept carrier) or factory unlocked (can accept any carrier). These unlock chips can bypass the carrier locks in iPhones and enable locked devices to work with any SIM.

An unlock chip is an easy and cheap way to get an Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max to work with a different SIM card Using iPhone unlock chip enables the locked Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max to call and send SMS using the local network sim card, just like a factory-unlocked phone does. There have been different unlocking chips available with different names and brands, but they all do the same thing.

![unlock chip](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/12/iphone-unlock-chip-1.jpg)

### How does it work

An unlock chip is typically a slim SIM card, a memory interface chip that can be put in along with your regular SIM card. It goes on top of your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max's normal SIM card and removes the network lock so you can use any sim.

![iphone unlock chip](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/12/iphone-unlock-chip-4.jpg)

The factory lock is removed quickly when an unlock chip is put into your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max. An iPhone Unlock Chip fools your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max into thinking it only uses a Cricket SIM card. The Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max Unlock Chip has the structure to fake the iPhone's IMEI number and the authentication key, which allows it to work with any GSM Service.

Putting an iPhone Unlock Chip around your regular SIM card changes how your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max and SIM card talk to each other. So, the unlock chip's controller fakes the IMSI number, which allows you to use other mobile networks.

Unfortunately, many iPhone unlock chips require a jailbroken iPhone before being used. Even if your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max isn't jailbroken, you can still use an iPhone unlock chip to access some of its features.

There are several places to find information about jailbreaking an iPhone. After selecting, you can program your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max's unlock chip by following the on-screen instructions.
