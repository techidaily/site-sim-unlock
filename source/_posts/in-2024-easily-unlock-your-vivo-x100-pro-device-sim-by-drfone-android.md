## Part 5: The benefits of an unlocked Vivo X100 Pro

If you now know how to unlock Vivo X100 Pro but still do not know its advantages, we are here to help.

As indicated in the introduction, unlocked phone users can freely choose the plans they subscribed to---on any carriers, in any country. Therefore, if you travel frequently around the world, having an unlocked Vivo X100 Pro would be beneficial. Using a local SIM card is much cheaper than paying for exorbitant roaming charges.

You can also benefit from an unlocked Vivo X100 Pro if you are the kind of person who likes to take advantage of current offers provided by your local carriers. Prepaid plans are always changing in terms of offering so having the flexibility of changing carriers and prepaid plans can help you save money in the long run.

## Part 6: The downside of an unlocked Vivo X100 Pro

Are you thinking "Well, why can't I just buy an unlocked Vivo X100 Pro in the first place?" right about now? Well, you can but think of the amount of money it will cost you.

For example, in Australia, an unlocked Vivo X100 Pro will cost around $499 from any Vivo outlet but $0 for the Vivo X100 Pro device when you pair it with a 24-month postpaid plan. While this may look attractive now, you may be paying more for a locked Vivo X100 Pro in the long run.

## Conclusion

Now that you know the three ways of unlocking your Vivo X100 Pro, all you need to do is find one that is most compatible with you. Just remember to think of everything through and carefully. Most importantly, if you have a locked device, always seek advice from your carrier to see if this is possible.
