### Method 2: Using an R-SIM

An R-SIM, or SIM interposer, acts as a bridge between your [<u>SIM card</u>](https://drfone.wondershare.com/sim-unlock/free-sim-network-unlock-pin.html) and the iPhone's hardware. It enables you to input the ICCID code and access a wider range of carrier options. This method is particularly useful if you're looking for a seamless and reliable way to configure your Apple iPhone 7's network settings. Below, we have gone through the steps of using an R-SIM to input the ICCID code:

- **Step 1:** Begin by inserting the R-SIM card into your Apple iPhone 7's SIM card tray. Ensure it is properly positioned and securely placed. For R-SIM versions starting from 14 and above, there's no need to manually dial a code. Upon inserting the R-SIM card, the Apple iPhone 7 device will automatically prompt you with a menu.
- **Step 2:** However, for earlier versions, open the Call app on your Apple iPhone 7. Dial 50057672\*00# and initiate the call. This action will trigger the appearance of the R-SIM menu. Once the R-SIM menu is visible, select the option labeled "Edit ICCID."
- **Step 3:** Now, enter the ICCID unlock code you got from the website mentioned above. With the new ICCID successfully entered, restart your Apple iPhone 7. After the reboot, your Apple iPhone 7 will recognize the updated ICCID and establish a connection with the desired network.

## How to Unlock Apple iPhone 7 with IMEI Code?

If you have a locked iPhone, we have different methods that entail how to unlock iPhone with IMEI code.

## Part 1: What is IMEI code? How to find IMEI Code on iPhone?

Each and every phone comes with a unique 15-digit code that differentiates it from other devices. This unique code acts as determinant or a tracking number when you happen to lose your phone. For those with iPhones, you can retrieve this unique number in different ways. The following are some of them.

**1.1 Dial \*#06#**

This is the primary method of checking your IMEI code on almost all devices. On your dial pad, dial \*#06# and press the call icon. Your unique code will be displayed immediately.
