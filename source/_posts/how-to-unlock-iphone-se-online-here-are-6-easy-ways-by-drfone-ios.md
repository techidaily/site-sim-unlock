## How To Unlock Apple iPhone SE: Official Method to Unlock Your Apple iPhone SE

Restriction on the use of a SIM card by a carrier often creates a lot of problems. The barrier that you can't use another company's SIM somehow makes you feel like you're not the only owner of the phone. But you don't need to worry anymore because you are in the right place to know about the way use to unlock your Apple iPhone SE.

This article is about the official way to get your Apple iPhone SE unlocked from your carrier. But we also have a solution if you want to avoid contacting your carrier.

## Part 1: What Should You Do Before Apple iPhone SE SIM Unlock?

Before unlocking your Apple iPhone SE from the carrier, you should fulfill the following criteria.

### 1\. No Due Before Unlocking

When iPhone users sign contracts with a giant cell phone company for a certain amount of time, they often get a discount on a device. Because of this, the Apple iPhone SE device comes with a controller lock so customers can only use it on their network.

So, if you've paid off your contract or bought your Apple iPhone SE without a subsidy, it's perfectly legal to unlock it. But if you're still paying off your contract, you still need to own the Apple iPhone SE fully, so you should confirm with your carrier before unlocking it.

### 2\. You Should Buy It for More Than the Time Limit in the Contract

You can leave without paying anything if your agreement with the company is over. If you signed a contract in exchange for a lower price upfront, you would have to wait until your contract ended (usually 24 months) or pay the remaining balance if you bought your phone on a payment plan.

### Examples: Requirements of Sim Unlock of T-Mobile/EE/AT&T

T-Mobile, EE, and AT&T have common requirements before you can unlock your Apple iPhone SE.

- It has to be legal. It means the Apple iPhone SE device has not been reported as lost, stolen, or linked to a crime.
- Your bank account shouldn't have any debts.
- If you signed a contract in exchange for a lower price upfront, you would have to wait until your contract was up (usually 24 months) or pay the remaining balance if you bought your phone on a payment plan.

Apart from the requirements mentioned above, each company has its way of unlocking.

**T-Mobile**

![t mobile](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/12/unlock-iphone-x-1.jpg)

Following are the unlocking requirements of T-Mobile.

- In the past year, fewer than two SIM unlock codes have been asked for on each individual.
- The device had been connected to the T-Mobile network for at least 40 days before the request to unlock it was made.
- You have a service contract and have paid for at least 18 months in a row, or you paid a fee for moving. Customer Service can tell you more about a few special situations if you need to.
- The phone's prepaid plan must have at least $50 worth of recharges paid for.
- If you meet the above requirements, you can call customer service at 611 from the Apple iPhone SE device you want to unlock to unlock an iPhone 11 or 12 that is locked to a T-Mobile network.
- When you call about tips, make sure you have ALL of the following:

1. The main account holder's phone number
2. Account Password
3. Account holder's SSN's last four digits
4. IMEI number. You can find this by navigating Settings > General > About or dialing \*#06#.

**AT&T**

![att](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/12/unlock-iphone-x-2.jpg)

Following are the unlocking requirements of AT&T.

- The iPhone's IMEI number is 11/12. The IMEI number is the same thing as the serial number. You can find it on the original packaging, under the battery, or on the back of some models by dialing #06 or going to Settings > General > About.

**EE**

![ee](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/12/unlock-iphone-x-3.jpg)

Following are the unlocking requirements of EE.

- EE will only unlock pay-per-month phones after six months.
- You need to call 150 from your EE phone. If you are still under contract, you will be charged £8.99. But if your contract is up, it's free.
- EE will unlock the Apple iPhone SE immediately; there is no waiting period. If you didn't buy the phone from EE, you'd have to pay £8.99. If that's the case, there's no fee.

## How Do I SIM Unlock My Apple iPhone SE?

If your Apple iPhone SE is locked to a particular carrier, it can be very frustrating. This is because your device will only be able to work with a SIM card from that provider and no other. This can be a problem when you want to change carriers. Some iPhones are generally easier to unlock than others, and the easiest way to unlock any iPhone is usually to use a paid online service. The issue is that these services can be very expensive.

In this article, we are going to look at how you can [sim unlock](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/unlock-android-screen/) your Apple iPhone SE. It is however important to note that if you purchased your device in the last one year, it is already unlocked.

Many people may wonder whether it is legal to unlock the iPhone. Actually, it is perfectly legal to unlock your Apple iPhone SE if you have completed payments on the contract, or you bought the Apple iPhone SE device outright. If however, you are still in the process of paying for your contract, you don't fully own the phone and so you should contact the carrier before unlocking it.

But if your Apple iPhone SE has [bad ESN](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/iphone-unlock/) or been blacklisted by the carrier, you can check the new post here to check what to do if you have a [blacklisted iPhone](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/iphone-unlock/).

##  Part 1: How to SIM Unlock Your Apple iPhone SE?

There are several ways to unlock your device. Let's look at a few of them.

### 1\. Contact your Carrier and Have them unlock the Apple iPhone SE device for you

This is probably the safest way to do it. If you have already completed payments on your Apple iPhone SE or you bought it outright, you can ask your carrier for the [sim network unlock pin](https://drfone.wondershare.com/unlock/unlock-samsung-sim-network-unlock-pin.html) to unlock your device. Depending on your carrier, you may have to pay for this service, and it also does take up to 7 days, sometimes more for them to get back to you.

### 2\. Software Unlocking

This is where you download a piece of [sim network unlock pin software](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/unlock-android-screen/) on to your device. This software makes changes to the Apple iPhone SE device, allowing you to make calls from any carrier. While this may sound straight-forward and easy, except it is highly risky and will not work for iPhone 4 and later models.

### 3\. Hardware Unlocking

This is where you alter the hardware of the Apple iPhone SE device to create an alternate path to deliver calls. Although this can be done, it also alters your device irreparably and probably also voids your warranty. Not to mention, you may pay more than $200 to have the Apple iPhone SE device unlocked in this way.

### 4\. IMEI unlocking

This is the best way to unlock your device and by far the easiest. This method uses your device's IMEI number to access the IMEI database and change the status of the Apple iPhone SE from locked to unlocked. There are very many services that you can use to IMEI unlock your device, and most of them will offer the service for a fee. But this is a great solution because there is no software to download, and you don't mess with the hardware in any way.

### Steps on How to Unlock Your Apple iPhone SE via IMEI

Like we mentioned before, there are a lot of services you can use to unlock your Apple iPhone SE. One of the best is [iPhoneIMEI.net](https://appleiphoneunlock.uk/network/Special%20Services/Activation%20Lock?aff=wondershare). This website helps you unlock the Apple iPhone SE in an official way, and it promises that the unlocked iPhone will not be relooked again. In this tutorial, we are going to use this website to show you how easy it is to unlock your Apple iPhone SE using your IMEI number.

Step 1: On your browser, navigate to [iPhoneIMEI.net](https://appleiphoneunlock.uk/network/Special%20Services/Activation%20Lock?aff=wondershare) from the home page. Select your Apple iPhone SE model and the network provider the phone is locked to. Then click on Unlock.

![sim unlock iphone with iphoneimei.net](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/03/apple-iphone-unlock.png)

Step 2: Next, you will be required to enter your IMEI number and get details of the price and how long it will take for the code to be generated. Click on “Unlock Now” and you will be sent to a payment page where you can complete the payment.

Step 3. After the payment is successful, the system will send your Apple iPhone SE IMEI to the network provider and whitelist it from Apple activation database (You will be received an email for this change). This step may take 1–5 days.

After the phone is successfully unlocked, you will get email notification too. When you see that email, just simply connect your Apple iPhone SE to a Wi-Fi network and insert any SIM card, your Apple iPhone SE should work instantly!

## Part 2: The Best SIM Unlock Service - Dr.Fone

A SIM unlock PIN is an effective way to remove your SIM lock effectively. However, it may not work sometimes.

For instance, some network providers require only the original owner of the phone can get the code. So, if you have a second-hand contract iPhone, you can't find the unlock PIN. If your Apple iPhone SE is X/8(Plus)/7(Plus)/SE/6S(Plus)/6(Plus)/5S, luckily, I will introduce an amazing software to help unlock your SIM card permanently. That is [Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock (iOS)](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/iphone-unlock/).
