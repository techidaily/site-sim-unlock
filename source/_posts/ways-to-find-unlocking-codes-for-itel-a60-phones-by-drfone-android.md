## Ways To Find Unlocking Codes For Itel A60 Phones

When you have a locked device, it is pretty much impossible to move from one network to another. This would cause problems if for instance you wanted to travel outside the country and want to switch to that country's carrier for the duration of your stay. Or maybe you just want to switch carriers because you don't like your current provider.

Whatever the reason, you should be able to unlock your device easily. But this has often proven difficult because of the fact that you need unlock codes. The problem is that many sites promise free unlocking codes for your device and many turn out to be fraudulent sites that use the word "free" in their advertising but actually require you to pay for the service. If you have been unsuccessfully searching for free unlocking codes for your device, look no further. This article compiles three of the best for Android and iPhone.

## How To Change Your SIM PIN Code on Your Itel A60 Phone

When you get a new SIM card, it usually comes with a default PIN (Personal Identity Number) code printed on the packaging, documentation, or back of the SIM card. This 4-digit code protects your phone number from unauthorized calls, texts, and data use. It’s essential to change the default PIN to one that’s both memorable for you and difficult for others to guess.

So, **how to change the PIN on an Android phone**’s SIM card? This article will provide a step-by-step guide to help you secure your data. But first, let’s explore why changing the default one is important.

![a phone sim card](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/02/how-to-change-pin-on-android-phone-01.jpg)

## Part 1: Why Does Changing Your SIM PIN Code Matter on a New Phone?

Your SIM PIN code acts as a password for your SIM card, which stores your phone number, contacts, and other essential data. Unlike the PIN you use to unlock your phone, the SIM PIN code is a separate layer of security. If someone tries to use your SIM card in another phone without the correct PIN, they won’t be able to access your network or data.

Here are more reasons why **changing the PIN code of a SIM card** is a smart move:

- Default PINs are easy to guess

Most carriers use generic PINs like “1234” or “0000”. Change it to something unique and harder to crack.

- Protects data in case of loss or theft

If you lose your phone or it gets stolen, a strong PIN code hinders the thief’s ability to make calls, send messages, or access your data stored on the SIM. It buys you time to report the loss and block your SIM card before they can do any damage.

![sim card locked](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/02/how-to-change-pin-on-android-phone-02.jpg)

- Prevents accidental PIN lockouts

Using a memorable PIN minimizes the risk of accidentally locking yourself out of your SIM card.

- Peace of mind

It is crucial if you store sensitive info on your SIM or use your phone for work. Knowing about this extra safeguard is reassuring, ensuring your data stays protected.

**Remember:**

Choose a PIN code for your SIM that’s easy for you to remember but challenging for others to guess. Avoid using birthdays, anniversaries, or other easily identifiable information. By taking a few minutes to **change the PIN code of the SIM card**, you’ll gain a significant security advantage for your new phone and data.

## Part 2: How To Change Pin on Android Phone SIM Cards?

Keeping your SIM card secure is crucial for protecting your data and privacy. Thankfully, Android allows you to easily change your SIM card PIN to a more personal and memorable code. But before you begin:

- Contact your network carrier to get your PUK code if you already have it. You’ll need this if you enter the wrong PIN three times and lock your SIM card.
- Remember the temporary default PIN: Most SIM cards have a default PIN, often 1234 or 0123. If you haven’t changed it, this is the PIN you’ll use initially.

**Note:**

Entering the wrong PIN three times will lock your SIM card. You’ll need your network carrier’s PUK code to unlock it. Use it cautiously, as exceeding the maximum number of attempts will permanently block your SIM card. So, it’s best to memorize your PIN or store it securely to avoid relying on the PUK altogether.

Steps To Change Your SIM PIN

Here’s **how to find and manage the SIM PIN code on Android**:

- **Step 1:** Navigate to your phone’s **Settings** app. Next, look for the **Security and privacy** or **Lock screen and security** (or other similar option) depending on your device’s model.
- **Step 2:** Scroll down and tap on **More security settings** or **Other security settings**.
- **Step 3:** Tap **SIM card security** or **Set up SIM card lock** (or something similar).

## Network Locked SIM Card Inserted On Your Itel A60 Phone? Unlock It Now

Carriers provide cellular connections so you can access the Internet, send text messages, and make phone calls without Wi-Fi. You cannot escape the carriers once you begin using a cell phone.

Customers can purchase a new handset via carriers or the mobile phone market. You may need an unlocked phone if you wish to use a different carrier's service on your smartphone. However, if you want a gadget linked to a specific SIM card, you may buy one from the carriers for a reduced price.

## Part 1: What Does It Mean If Your Itel A60 Asks for SIM Network PIN?

When your phone prompts you to enter a SIM Network Unlock PIN, it means that your device is currently locked to a specific mobile network carrier, and it can only be used with SIM cards from that carrier. This locking mechanism is usually put in place by the carrier or the phone manufacturer to ensure that you continue to use their services, typically for the duration of a contract. As a result, your phone cannot be freely used with SIM cards from other carriers until it's unlocked using the correct PIN or code.

**System Errors**

Since SIM locking is a smartphone restriction implemented to stop it from being used on other networks, Android system errors can cause network-locked SIM cards. Resetting these errors can help unlock your **network locked SIM card inserted** device. Service providers decided to provide a formal SIM unlocking option as a result.

Because of this, any locked SIM may be readily unlocked, and once a device opens, it can work like a conventional mobile phone and with any SIM card of the user's choosing.

**Carrier Lock**

The consumer must stick with the same service provider for a specific time after purchasing the bundled device and data pack. This is called a carrier lock on the Itel A60 device and is one of the most common errors in **network locked SIM card inserted** devices. During that time, the Itel A60 device will be network- or SIM-locked, prohibiting the user from changing service providers.

The user cannot change the SIM. The service provider will offer the SIM Unlock code needed to unlock the handset when the contract expires. The gadget can be used with any other SIM card and exported to another country without problems when the network lock has been removed.

**Region Lock**

Apple and AT&T initially worked together to implement the SIM lock and the SIM locked devices. The original purpose was to force the user to continue using the same service provider in a specific area or time.

However, some telecom service providers sell the handsets with select data plans as bundled plans in collaboration with the Itel A60 device manufacturers. As a result, the handset will cost less than it would otherwise. Sometimes, these offers are particular to a specific region, called a carrier lock.

**Firmware Problems**

Sometimes, the Itel A60 device manufacturers release many versions of the same firmware for different geographical locations.

As a result, it may be possible that the user may face contradictions in the agreement of device firmware and the network-locked SIM card that was supposed to be used on the Itel A60 device. Due to firmware problems, the users may also face a network-locked SIM card-inserted device.

## Part 4: Why is SIM Unlocking Important?

As previously stated, a SIM lock enables a service provider to stop a customer from using the smartphone with the SIM cards of another service provider. This guarantees that the Itel A60 device is only being used with the original SIM card for each provider. This locking also has a lot of drawbacks because it is incompatible with any other SIM card.

1. The phone cannot be used with other SIM cards if the SIM lock is enabled. Customers must therefore adhere to the current plan as is.
2. Since nobody wants to purchase a locked phone, it is hard for someone to sell or gift the mobile.
3. Traveling abroad with a SIM-locked phone could provide some challenges because you won't be able to use a local SIM card on the phone while you're there.

All the problems can be fixed, and the SIM works in any nation with the removed SIM lock.
