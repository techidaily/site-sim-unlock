## Part 2: 2 Ways to Remove SIM Lock on Apple iPhone 6s Plus

### Way 1: Contact Your Carrier for Apple iPhone 6s Plus SIM Unlock

So, if you fulfill the above requirements, you can contact your carrier and request them to unlock your sim Lock restriction. Follow the steps below to contact your carrier.

**Get the IMEI code on your phone.**

First of all, get the IMEI code on your Apple iPhone 6s Plus. The serial number and the IMEI number are the same things. You can find it on the original box, on the back of some models, under the battery, by dialing #06 or going to Settings > General > About.

Now you have to contact the service provider for an unlocking request. For this, Go to the official site of your service provider and send them an unlocking request or call on their helpline. They will ask you for the IMEI number of your Apple iPhone 6s Plus and then guide you through the different processes. The unlocking request may take a few days.

**If all goes well, you can get the unlock code.**

After receiving the unlocking request, the company will pass the request through all the parameters. If everything goes according to company policy, the company will e-mail an unlock code. You will have to enter the code into your mobile.

**Insert the SIM card from the new carrier and enter the unlock code**

The unlock code may be 8 to 16 digits long. Follow the steps to enter unlock code.
