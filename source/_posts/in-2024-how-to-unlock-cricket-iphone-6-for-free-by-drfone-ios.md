## Part 3: How to unlock T Mobile iPhone via T Mobile carrier

If you want to unlock, say for example, a T Mobile iPhone 5s without a third-party tool, but by contacting the carrier directly, you can do that as well though that process would have a lot more restrictions and take a lot longer. Requesting carriers to T Mobile unlock iPhone 5s is becoming more and more of an outdated concept in the face of far easier third-party softwares. However, contacting the carriers directly is also a legitimate means. So read on to find out how to unlock T Mobile iPhone 5s via T Mobile carrier.

### How to unlock T Mobile iPhone 5s via T Mobile carrier

#### **Step 1:** Eligibility

When you try to unlock T Mobile iPhone 5s directly through the carrier you are faced with a lot of restrictions and verification processes. Hence, to keep yourself from wasting your own time, you should go and read their page on eligibility to make sure you pass the test. Follow this link: support.t-mobile.com/docs/DOC-1588.

#### **Step 2:** Contact

Next you simply need to go to their Customer Care page and file a request for the unlock code. Follow the following link to contact them: <https://support.t-mobile.com/community/contact-us>. However you should bear in mind that they can reject any application at all.

![unlock t mobile iphone-unlock T Mobile iPhone 5s via T Mobile carrier](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2016/10/14772481095475.jpg)

#### **Step 3:** Receive Code

If your application is accepted, then you should soon receive an email with the unlock code and further instructions to T Mobile unlock iPhone 5s. Alternatively you could simply use the Mobile Device Unlock App, but that isn't yet eligible for iPhones.

#### **Step 4:** Unlock T Mobile iPhone 5s

Finally, all you have to do is enter the unlock code to your keypad and voila! You now have a T Mobile unlock iPhone 5s.

#### Alternative: Mobile Device Unlock App

This app can't yet be used to unlock T Mobile iPhone 5s devices as it is only yet available for Samsung Avant devices, however this is a helpful and simple software for those with Samsung devices. You just install the app and you can apply for the unlock code with two simple steps.

## Part 4: How to check if my iPhone is unlocked or not

Before you take some drastic and time consuming measures it might be helpful to confirm whether you already have an unlocked phone. If you have a SIM with a separate network provider you can simply enter it and see whether it's accessible. However, if you don't currently have another SIM card, you can use DoctorSIM to also verify your unlock status with 3 simple steps. To do so you need to first go to this link [here](https://www.doctorsim.com/libtrkafl.html?pc=43d47c30d945bcbd7d9527f4049f649a&refe=https://www.doctorsim.com/us-en/?scp&euro)

### Check your Apple iPhone 6 unlock status

#### **Step 1:** Retrieve IMEI

Type #06# on your Apple iPhone 6 keypad to get the IMEI Code.

#### **Step 2:** Fill in the Request Form

Next, enter the first 15 digits of the IMEI code, followed by your email address.

![unlock t mobile iphone-check iphone unlock status](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/drfone-ios/check-iPhone-unlock-status.jpg)

#### **Step 3:** Receive Email

You'll soon receive an email with your unlock status.

And just like that you now know whether to go ahead to unlock T Mobile iPhone!

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### I don't have another SIM

In this case the process is a little longer. Do the following to activate the unlock:

#### **Step 1:** Back Up

You can back up easily with iCloud. It is a very simple solution. Simply go to settings on your Apple iPhone 6, followed by 'iCloud', then tap 'Back up now.'

![unlock t mobile iphone-backup iphone](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14772493104899.jpg) ![unlock t mobile iphone-back up iphone](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14772493145526.jpg)

#### **Step 2:** Erase iPhone

Go to Settings> General> Reset> Erase All Content. This will wipe your phone clean.

![unlock t mobile iphone-erase iphone](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14772495041479.jpg)

#### **Step 3:** Restore

Finally, just restore all the information from the iCloud back up. This is also fairly simple. As you follow the system setup after erasing, you'll be taken to the 'Apps & Data' screen. Simply select 'Restore from iCloud Backup.'

![unlock t mobile iphone-restore iphone](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14772497801720.jpg)

With that your Apple iPhone 6 is now completely unlock activated! You're free to use it as you please now.

In this article we've explained how to unlock T Mobile Apple iPhone 6 using DoctorSIM - SIM Unlock Service, and how to unlock T Mobile iPhone 5s using the T Mobile carrier itself. While both of them are perfectly legitimate means of unlocking your Apple iPhone 6s, I personally lean more towards the DoctorSIM solution as they don't have any pesky eligibility criteria, nor do they make you wait long. They are a 100% solution, especially considering they're a third-party tool which makes them less biased as they don't have an incentive to keep you from unlocking. Well, we hope this helped and hopefully now you have a T Mobile unlock iPhone!
