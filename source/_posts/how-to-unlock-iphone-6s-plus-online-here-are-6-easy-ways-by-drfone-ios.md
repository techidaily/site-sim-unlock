## How Do I SIM Unlock My Apple iPhone 6s Plus?

If your Apple iPhone 6s Plus is locked to a particular carrier, it can be very frustrating. This is because your device will only be able to work with a SIM card from that provider and no other. This can be a problem when you want to change carriers. Some iPhones are generally easier to unlock than others, and the easiest way to unlock any iPhone is usually to use a paid online service. The issue is that these services can be very expensive.

In this article, we are going to look at how you can [sim unlock](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/unlock-android-screen/) your Apple iPhone 6s Plus. It is however important to note that if you purchased your device in the last one year, it is already unlocked.

Many people may wonder whether it is legal to unlock the iPhone. Actually, it is perfectly legal to unlock your Apple iPhone 6s Plus if you have completed payments on the contract, or you bought the Apple iPhone 6s Plus device outright. If however, you are still in the process of paying for your contract, you don't fully own the phone and so you should contact the carrier before unlocking it.

But if your Apple iPhone 6s Plus has [bad ESN](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/iphone-unlock/) or been blacklisted by the carrier, you can check the new post here to check what to do if you have a [blacklisted iPhone](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/iphone-unlock/).

## Â Part 1: How to SIM Unlock Your Apple iPhone 6s Plus?

There are several ways to unlock your device. Let's look at a few of them.

<!-- affiliate ads begin -->
<a href="https://zonlipartnershipprogram.pxf.io/c/5597632/1611407/17882" target="_top" id="1611407"><img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17882-1611407" border="0" alt="" width="300" height="485"/></a><img height="0" width="0" src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1611407/17882" style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0" />
<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### 1\. Contact your Carrier and Have them unlock the Apple iPhone 6s Plus device for you

This is probably the safest way to do it. If you have already completed payments on your Apple iPhone 6s Plus or you bought it outright, you can ask your carrier for the [sim network unlock pin](https://drfone.wondershare.com/unlock/unlock-samsung-sim-network-unlock-pin.html) to unlock your device. Depending on your carrier, you may have to pay for this service, and it also does take up to 7 days, sometimes more for them to get back to you.

### 2\. Software Unlocking

This is where you download a piece of [sim network unlock pin software](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/unlock-android-screen/) on to your device. This software makes changes to the Apple iPhone 6s Plus device, allowing you to make calls from any carrier. While this may sound straight-forward and easy, except it is highly risky and will not work for iPhone 4 and later models.

### 3\. Hardware Unlocking

This is where you alter the hardware of the Apple iPhone 6s Plus device to create an alternate path to deliver calls. Although this can be done, it also alters your device irreparably and probably also voids your warranty. Not to mention, you may pay more than $200 to have the Apple iPhone 6s Plus device unlocked in this way.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### 4\. IMEI unlocking

This is the best way to unlock your device and by far the easiest. This method uses your device's IMEI number to access the IMEI database and change the status of the Apple iPhone 6s Plus from locked to unlocked. There are very many services that you can use to IMEI unlock your device, and most of them will offer the service for a fee. But this is a great solution because there is no software to download, and you don't mess with the hardware in any way.

### Steps on How to Unlock Your Apple iPhone 6s Plus via IMEI

![sim unlock iphone with iphoneimei.net](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/03/apple-iphone-unlock.png)

Step 2: Next, you will be required to enter your IMEI number and get details of the price and how long it will take for the code to be generated. Click on âUnlock Nowâ and you will be sent to a payment page where you can complete the payment.

Step 3. After the payment is successful, the system will send your Apple iPhone 6s Plus IMEI to the network provider and whitelist it from Apple activation database (You will be received an email for this change). This step may take 1â5 days.

After the phone is successfully unlocked, you will get email notification too. When you see that email, just simply connect your Apple iPhone 6s Plus to a Wi-Fi network and insert any SIM card, your Apple iPhone 6s Plus should work instantly!

## Part 2: The Best SIM Unlock Service - Dr.Fone

A SIM unlock PIN is an effective way to remove your SIM lock effectively. However, it may not work sometimes.

For instance, some network providers require only the original owner of the phone can get the code. So, if you have a second-hand contract iPhone, you can't find the unlock PIN. If your Apple iPhone 6s Plus is X/8(Plus)/7(Plus)/SE/6S(Plus)/6(Plus)/5S, luckily, I will introduce an amazing software to help unlock your SIM card permanently. That isÂ [Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock (iOS)](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/iphone-unlock/).

This guide will give you what you need to **unlock Telstra iPhones** and other phones.

## Method 1: How To Unlock Apple iPhone 6s Plus With Telstraâs Official Methods

For peace of mind and guaranteed success, unlocking your Telstra iPhone through Telstraâs official methods is the ideal choice. This straightforward approach ensures a smooth transition and adheres to carrier policies, eliminating potential complications. There are two main options offered to **unlock Telstra phones.**

### Option 1: Freedom After Two Years

If youâve been loyal to Telstra and maintained a phone plan for 24 months or more, congratulations! Youâre entitled to **unlock your Telstra phone for free**. This allows you to explore other networks without any additional cost. Contact Telstra through their app or phone; their friendly representatives will guide you through the process.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### Option 2: Pay as You Go

Havenât quite reached the two-year mark yet? Donât worry! Telstra offers a paid unlocking option based on how long youâve been with them:

- **Under 6 months:**$80 unlock fee
- **6 months to 2 years:**$25 unlock fee

Remember that these fees are subject to change, so itâs always best to double-check with Telstraâs website or customer service for the latest information.

### How To Request for Telstra Phone Unlock

To unlock your Telstra phone, follow the steps below using the said options. Both utilize Telstraâs official customer representative line, after all.

![my telstra app app store](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/02/how-to-unlock-telstra-02.jpg)

- **Step 1:** Find your IMEI number. This unique 17-digit code identifies your phone. Dial \*#06# on your Apple iPhone 6s Plus, or locate it on the back of the phone (if applicable) or the original box.
- **Step 2:** Use the My Telstra app under the âGet Helpâ section, call 125 8887 from a Telstra phone, 13 22 00 from a non-Telstra phone, or +61 439 125 888 if youâre overseas.
- **Step 3:** A Telstra representative will guide you through the process, explain any applicable fees, and assist you with payment if you are still within the 2-year period.

Before proceeding, itâs important to back up your phone data, as unlocking might erase it. Once complete, your Apple iPhone 6s Plus will be network-lock-free, ready to embrace the world beyond Telstra.

While this information is current, visiting Telstraâs website or contacting their customer service for the latest fee structure and any policy updates is advisable. Also, note that this method can **unlock Telstra phones** other than iPhones.

## Method 2: How To Unlock iPhones With a Third-Party Phone Tool \[Recommended\]

For those seeking a potentially faster route to **unlock Telstra iPhones** or those who wish to avoid opening fees, third-party phone unlocking tools like Wondershare Dr.Fone present an alternative option. However, itâs crucial to consider the potential trade-offs before venturing down this path.

![dr.fone my device page](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/connect-my-device-2.png)

Among Dr.Foneâs features lies the coveted âSIM Unlockâ functionality. This tool aims to remove carrier-imposed restrictions, allowing your Telstra Apple iPhone 6s Plus to work with other compatible networks. While seemingly convenient, itâs essential to understand the nuances before proceeding.

Dr.Foneâs SIM Unlock can bypass the carrier lock on your Apple iPhone 6s Plus, enabling it to operate with SIM cards from different networks.

### How Does Dr.Foneâs SIM Unlock Work?

The steps involved in using Dr.Foneâs SIM Unlock vary depending on your Apple iPhone 6s Plus and iOS version.. Generally, the process involves connecting your Apple iPhone 6s Plus to your computer, selecting the âSIM Unlockâ function, and following the on-screen prompts. To be more specific, follow the steps below:

- **Step 1:** Download and install [Wondershare Dr.Fone](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/drfone-toolkit/) from the official website and launch it on your computer.


- **Step 2:** On the Dr.Fone homepage, go to **Toolbox > Screen Unlock > iOS**. Connect your Apple iPhone 6s Plus with the appropriate cable, too.

![dr.fone sim lock removal success](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/remove-iphone-sim-7.png)

**Disclaimer:** Itâs vital to note that unlocking methods, particularly with third-party tools, may not always be successful, especially for newer iPhone models and iOS versions. Also, using third-party unlocking tools can void your phoneâs warranty, leaving you responsible for any future repairs not covered by the manufacturer.

## Method 3: Using Online Unlockers To Unlock Telstra iPhones

While venturing into the online realm, you might encounter websites offering remote unlocking services for a fee. These services claim to **unlock your Telstra phone** quickly and conveniently, often without contacting the carrier. However, approaching this method requires extreme caution due to potential risks and legal implications.

Before diving in:

- **Understand the risks.**Online unlocking services operate in a gray area, potentially violating your carrierâs terms and conditions. This could lead to legal trouble or void your phoneâs warranty.
- **Beware of scams.**Unfortunately, not all online unlocking services are legitimate. Many are scams designed to steal your money or personal information.
- **Do your research.**If you choose to proceed, thoroughly research the service provider. Read reviews from other users, check their track record, and ensure they have a good reputation.

These services typically require you to provide your phoneâs IMEI number and pay a fee. They then claim to use various methods, often software or network vulnerabilities, to unlock your phone remotely. However, the success rate and security of these methods are highly questionable. Thus, relying on Dr.Fone as an alternative unlocking method is recommended.

## Conclusion

**Unlocking Telstra iPhones** gives you network flexibility, but navigating the process requires a measured approach. Remember, while Telstraâs official methods offer a guaranteed and secure path to freedom, third-party tools like Wondershare Dr.Fone present a potential avenue for those seeking alternative solutions.

After all, Wondershare Dr.Fone remains a valuable tool for your broader phone needs. From data recovery to system repair, its diverse functionalities can enhance your mobile experience in various ways. You can use it as an all-in-one application for all your needs, from network unlocking to system repair.
