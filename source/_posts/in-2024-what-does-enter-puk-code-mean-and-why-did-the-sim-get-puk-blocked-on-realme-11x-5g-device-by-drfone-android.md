## What Does 'Enter PUK Code' Mean And Why Did The Sim Get PUK Blocked On Realme 11X 5G Device

If your SIM card is disabled, you probably entered the incorrect PIN code too frequently. Your SIM locks itself after three to five wrong inputs, on average. Although it might be annoying, doing these guards against unauthorized access to your phone and personal data. If your cell phone is lost or stolen, PUK blocked will prevent prospective hackers from making calls.

Your mobile phone display can say “PIN blocked” or "Enter PUK code." PUK stands for PIN Unblocking Key in the PUK code. The PUK code is seldom given to you when you receive your membership in the US. Contact Your Realme 11X 5G provider's customer support if you don't know your PUK code.

### 1\. 3 times incorrect Pin entered

Sometimes when you forget your pin and keep on entering the wrong one, you can get PUK Blocked. You can utilize three to five chances, and your sim gets blocked when you enter the incorrect pin in all of these attempts.

### 2\. Wrong PUK code entered

Sims are frequently blocked; therefore, if you have your PUK, keep it in a secure location separate from your phone. This is because it is the key to unlocking your SIM. The SIM will be permanently disabled, and you will have to buy a new SIM card if you input the wrong PUK ten times in a row.

## Part 2: What To Do When I Blocked My Sim Card?

Your SIM card has been disabled to protect your security if you enter three wrong PINs and your phone shows "SIM card banned" or "Enter PUK code".

You must input a PUK (PIN Unlock Key) code to unlock your SIM card.

Go to your phone's settings to customize your PIN code after using a PUK code to unlock your SIM card. Pick a PIN that is simple to remember.

If your PUK code was delivered to you by email:

You got an email with multiple codes, including PUK1, PIN2, and PUK2.

![go to settings and customize to unblock sim](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/10/how-to-unlock-puk-blocked-sim-card-1.jpg)

If your PIN is locked, use PUK1 to unlock it.

Only a few phones employ PIN2 and PUK2 codes to restrict access to certain SIM card functionalities.

PIN2: The default code for your SIM card; If this code has been altered, use the PUK2 code to restore it.

PUK2: Your PIN2's unlock code if it has been blocked.

## Part 3: How Can I Have My PUK Code To Unlock Sim Card?

### 1\. Get it from sim card packaging

The packing box is the best and easiest place to look for the PUK code to unlock your SIM card.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![sim card packaging to unlock sim card](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/10/how-to-unlock-puk-blocked-sim-card-2.jpg)

You probably have memories of the flat plastic package you got when you bought a SIM card. Your PUK and default SIM pin code should be written on the package.

<!-- affiliate ads begin -->
<a href="https://coinrule.sjv.io/c/5597632/1958374/18409" target="_top" id="1958374"><img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18409-1958374" border="0" alt="" width="300" height="300"/></a><img height="0" width="0" src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1958374/18409" style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0" />
<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![find the pin code on flat plastic package](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/10/how-to-unlock-puk-blocked-sim-card-3.jpg)

Please look around your home for the package and look on the back for the key. On some older packaging, it could be sealed behind a scratchable region, whereas on other, more recent ones, you might find it unsealed.

<!-- affiliate ads begin -->
<a href="https://printrendy.pxf.io/c/5597632/1453719/17020" target="_top" id="1453719"><img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17020-1453719" border="0" alt="" width="300" height="250"/></a><img height="0" width="0" src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1453719/17020" style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0" />
<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![look at the back of the package and find puk code](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/10/how-to-unlock-puk-blocked-sim-card-4.jpg)

In either case, the correct PUK has 8 numbers and should be simple to enter to unlock your SIM card.

### 2\. Have it from carrier website

In all honesty, I doubt I'll ever be able to locate my SIM card package again, and I imagine most people feel the same way.

But happily, a lot of cell companies let you access your account on their app or website to check your SIM card PUK. Please log in to the appropriate website or app, then go to your profile to see whether anything about "PUK" is available there.

![go to career website and check your sim card puk](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/10/how-to-unlock-puk-blocked-sim-card-5.jpg)

It shouldn't be an issue if you were utilizing or signed in to the platform before your SIM was disabled. However, if not, you might not be able to access anything since you could be asked to input an OTP to verify your identity.

Please remove the SIM card and try again if you can't access your phone to utilize the app or website because of the SIM lock. After receiving the PUK code, you can re-insert the SIM and input it.

### 3\. Contact your carrier

It's time to call customer support, which should be simpler for most individuals if none of the above options work for you. For example, your mobile service provider created your SIM card. Therefore, they have all the information you would require. Before they divulge anything to you, though, they should be able to verify your identity.

Use a different phone to call your customer service number and describe the issue. And following a series of inquiries, they should offer your PUK number as identification.

![solve the sim card not accessed issue](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/10/how-to-unlock-puk-blocked-sim-card-6.jpg)

However, customer service won't release the code if you can't back yourself up. And at that point, there's probably nothing further you can do. Therefore, make sure you have some information, such as your name, address, date of birth, etc., before you call them.

## How To Change Your SIM PIN Code on Your Realme 11X 5G Phone

When you get a new SIM card, it usually comes with a default PIN (Personal Identity Number) code printed on the packaging, documentation, or back of the SIM card. This 4-digit code protects your phone number from unauthorized calls, texts, and data use. It’s essential to change the default PIN to one that’s both memorable for you and difficult for others to guess.

So, **how to change the PIN on an Android phone**’s SIM card? This article will provide a step-by-step guide to help you secure your data. But first, let’s explore why changing the default one is important.

## Part 1: Why Does Changing Your SIM PIN Code Matter on a New Phone?

Your SIM PIN code acts as a password for your SIM card, which stores your phone number, contacts, and other essential data. Unlike the PIN you use to unlock your phone, the SIM PIN code is a separate layer of security. If someone tries to use your SIM card in another phone without the correct PIN, they won’t be able to access your network or data.

Here are more reasons why **changing the PIN code of a SIM card** is a smart move:

- Default PINs are easy to guess

Most carriers use generic PINs like “1234” or “0000”. Change it to something unique and harder to crack.

- Protects data in case of loss or theft

If you lose your phone or it gets stolen, a strong PIN code hinders the thief’s ability to make calls, send messages, or access your data stored on the SIM. It buys you time to report the loss and block your SIM card before they can do any damage.

- Prevents accidental PIN lockouts

Using a memorable PIN minimizes the risk of accidentally locking yourself out of your SIM card.

- Peace of mind

It is crucial if you store sensitive info on your SIM or use your phone for work. Knowing about this extra safeguard is reassuring, ensuring your data stays protected.

**Remember:**

Choose a PIN code for your SIM that’s easy for you to remember but challenging for others to guess. Avoid using birthdays, anniversaries, or other easily identifiable information. By taking a few minutes to **change the PIN code of the SIM card**, you’ll gain a significant security advantage for your new phone and data.

## Part 2: How To Change Pin on Android Phone SIM Cards?

Keeping your SIM card secure is crucial for protecting your data and privacy. Thankfully, Android allows you to easily change your SIM card PIN to a more personal and memorable code. But before you begin:

- Contact your network carrier to get your PUK code if you already have it. You’ll need this if you enter the wrong PIN three times and lock your SIM card.
- Remember the temporary default PIN: Most SIM cards have a default PIN, often 1234 or 0123. If you haven’t changed it, this is the PIN you’ll use initially.

**Note:**

Entering the wrong PIN three times will lock your SIM card. You’ll need your network carrier’s PUK code to unlock it. Use it cautiously, as exceeding the maximum number of attempts will permanently block your SIM card. So, it’s best to memorize your PIN or store it securely to avoid relying on the PUK altogether.

Steps To Change Your SIM PIN

Here’s **how to find and manage the SIM PIN code on Android**:

- **Step 1:** Navigate to your phone’s **Settings** app. Next, look for the **Security and privacy** or **Lock screen and security** (or other similar option) depending on your device’s model.
- **Step 2:** Scroll down and tap on **More security settings** or **Other security settings**.
- **Step 3:** Tap **SIM card security** or **Set up SIM card lock** (or something similar).

![sim card security in settings](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/02/how-to-change-pin-on-android-phone-03.jpg)

- **Step 4:** If you have multiple SIMs, select the one you want to change the PIN code.
- **Step 5:** Tap **Change SIM PIN**.

## Part 3: What To Do if You Forgot or Lost an iOS Device’s SIM PIN Code?

If you’re an Android user, changing your SIM PIN is easy. But for iPhone users, forgetting it can lock you out. So, what should you do if you **lose the SIM PIN** code on iOS?

First, avoid guessing your SIM PIN or PUK code. Every wrong guess increases the risk of permanently locking your SIM card, requiring a replacement. If you forget your PIN, contact your network carrier for help. They can usually unlock your SIM with the default PIN or PUK code. If that fails, you can request a new SIM card.

However, there might also be situations where you’re locked out due to a carrier-restricted SIM card. If a quick resolution is important or you want to keep your current SIM card, consider using [Wondershare Dr.Fone](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/drfone-toolkit/).
