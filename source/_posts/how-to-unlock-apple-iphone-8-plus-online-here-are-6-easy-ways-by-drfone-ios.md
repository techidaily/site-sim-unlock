### Method 1: GPP LTE Chip

An array of techniques are available for entering the ICCID code on your Apple iPhone 8 Plus. Among them, the GPP LTE chip method stands out as a reliable and effective approach. This method capitalizes on a specialized chip to streamline the process. It provides users a seamless pathway to unlock their iPhone's network potential. By following these clear steps, users can leverage the power of the GPP LTE chip:

- **Step 1:** Begin by locating and opening the "Settings" application on your Apple iPhone 8 Plus. Inside the Settings app, navigate through the available options and select the one labeled "SIM." Within the SIM settings, you'll come across an option referred to as "ICCID."
- **Step 2:** This is where you'll need to input the new ICCID obtained from the aforementioned websites. Following the ICCID entry, you'll encounter a menu. Here, choose "Perfect" or "Sharp" mode.
- **Step 3:** Open the slot for your SIM card, remove the SIM card, and insert the GPP activation chip in its place. Now, put the SIM card above the chip and put it back into your Apple iPhone 8 Plus. After securing the new SIM card, connect your Apple iPhone 8 Plus to a Wi-Fi network.
- **Step 4:** With the new SIM card in place and a stable Wi-Fi connection established, give the GPP chip a few minutes to recognize the new SIM card. During this time, the chip will configure itself to work with the new ICCID.

### Method 2: Using an R-SIM

An R-SIM, or SIM interposer, acts as a bridge between your [<u>SIM card</u>](https://drfone.wondershare.com/sim-unlock/free-sim-network-unlock-pin.html) and the iPhone's hardware. It enables you to input the ICCID code and access a wider range of carrier options. This method is particularly useful if you're looking for a seamless and reliable way to configure your Apple iPhone 8 Plus's network settings. Below, we have gone through the steps of using an R-SIM to input the ICCID code:

- **Step 1:** Begin by inserting the R-SIM card into your Apple iPhone 8 Plus's SIM card tray. Ensure it is properly positioned and securely placed. For R-SIM versions starting from 14 and above, there's no need to manually dial a code. Upon inserting the R-SIM card, the Apple iPhone 8 Plus device will automatically prompt you with a menu.
- **Step 2:** However, for earlier versions, open the Call app on your Apple iPhone 8 Plus. Dial 50057672\*00# and initiate the call. This action will trigger the appearance of the R-SIM menu. Once the R-SIM menu is visible, select the option labeled "Edit ICCID."
- **Step 3:** Now, enter the ICCID unlock code you got from the website mentioned above. With the new ICCID successfully entered, restart your Apple iPhone 8 Plus. After the reboot, your Apple iPhone 8 Plus will recognize the updated ICCID and establish a connection with the desired network.
