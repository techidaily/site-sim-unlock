Because of this, the Apple iPhone 13 Pro device has a controller lock, so customers can only use it on their network. You can leave without paying anything if your contract with the company is over. Before you can unlock your Apple iPhone 13 Pro, you have to do the following:

First, it has to be legal. It means the Apple iPhone 13 Pro device has not been reported as lost, stolen, or linked to a crime.

Then your bank account shouldn't have any debts. If you signed a contract in exchange for a lower price upfront, you would have to wait until your contract was up (usually 24 months) or pay the remaining balance if you bought your phone on a payment plan. Each company has its way of unlocking.

If you signed a contract in exchange for a lower up-front cost, you'd have to wait until your contract ends (usually 24 months) or pay the remaining balance if you purchased your phone on a payment schedule.

Most carriers need active accounts for specific days before unlocking devices. Sprint has 50 days, T-Mobile 40, and AT&T 60. Verizon has no minimum period if you need to factory reset your phone to use the new network and back up beforehand.
