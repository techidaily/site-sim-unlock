## How Do I SIM Unlock My Apple iPhone 6s?

If your Apple iPhone 6s is locked to a particular carrier, it can be very frustrating. This is because your device will only be able to work with a SIM card from that provider and no other. This can be a problem when you want to change carriers. Some iPhones are generally easier to unlock than others, and the easiest way to unlock any iPhone is usually to use a paid online service. The issue is that these services can be very expensive.

In this article, we are going to look at how you can [sim unlock](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/unlock-android-screen/) your Apple iPhone 6s. It is however important to note that if you purchased your device in the last one year, it is already unlocked.

Actually, it is perfectly legal to unlock your Apple iPhone 6s if you have completed payments on the contract, or you bought the Apple iPhone 6s device outright. If however, you are still in the process of paying for your contract, you don't fully own the phone and so you should contact the carrier before unlocking it.

### 1\. Contact your Carrier and Have them unlock the Apple iPhone 6s device for you

This software makes changes to the Apple iPhone 6s device, allowing you to make calls from any carrier. While this may sound straight-forward and easy, except it is highly risky and will not work for iPhone 4 and later models.

### 3\. Hardware Unlocking

This method uses your device's IMEI number to access the IMEI database and change the status of the Apple iPhone 6s from locked to unlocked.
