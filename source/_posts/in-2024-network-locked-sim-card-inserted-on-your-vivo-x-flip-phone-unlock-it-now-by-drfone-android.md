## Network Locked SIM Card Inserted On Your Vivo X Flip Phone? Unlock It Now

Carriers provide cellular connections so you can access the Internet, send text messages, and make phone calls without Wi-Fi. You cannot escape the carriers once you begin using a cell phone.

Customers can purchase a new handset via carriers or the mobile phone market. You may need an unlocked phone if you wish to use a different carrier's service on your smartphone. However, if you want a gadget linked to a specific SIM card, you may buy one from the carriers for a reduced price.

## Part 1: What Does It Mean If Your Vivo X Flip Asks for SIM Network PIN?

When your phone prompts you to enter a SIM Network Unlock PIN, it means that your device is currently locked to a specific mobile network carrier, and it can only be used with SIM cards from that carrier. This locking mechanism is usually put in place by the carrier or the phone manufacturer to ensure that you continue to use their services, typically for the duration of a contract. As a result, your phone cannot be freely used with SIM cards from other carriers until it's unlocked using the correct PIN or code.

![remove network lock](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/11/fix-network-locked-simcard-inserted-2.jpg)

**System Errors**

Since SIM locking is a smartphone restriction implemented to stop it from being used on other networks, Android system errors can cause network-locked SIM cards. Resetting these errors can help unlock your **network locked SIM card inserted** device. Service providers decided to provide a formal SIM unlocking option as a result.

Because of this, any locked SIM may be readily unlocked, and once a device opens, it can work like a conventional mobile phone and with any SIM card of the user's choosing.

**Carrier Lock**

The consumer must stick with the same service provider for a specific time after purchasing the bundled device and data pack. This is called a carrier lock on the Vivo X Flip device and is one of the most common errors in **network locked SIM card inserted** devices. During that time, the Vivo X Flip device will be network- or SIM-locked, prohibiting the user from changing service providers.

The user cannot change the SIM. The service provider will offer the SIM Unlock code needed to unlock the handset when the contract expires. The gadget can be used with any other SIM card and exported to another country without problems when the network lock has been removed.

**Region Lock**

Apple and AT&T initially worked together to implement the SIM lock and the SIM locked devices. The original purpose was to force the user to continue using the same service provider in a specific area or time.

However, some telecom service providers sell the handsets with select data plans as bundled plans in collaboration with the Vivo X Flip device manufacturers. As a result, the handset will cost less than it would otherwise. Sometimes, these offers are particular to a specific region, called a carrier lock.

**Firmware Problems**

Sometimes, the Vivo X Flip device manufacturers release many versions of the same firmware for different geographical locations.

As a result, it may be possible that the user may face contradictions in the agreement of device firmware and the network-locked SIM card that was supposed to be used on the Vivo X Flip device. Due to firmware problems, the users may also face a network-locked SIM card-inserted device.

## Part 4: Why is SIM Unlocking Important?

As previously stated, a SIM lock enables a service provider to stop a customer from using the smartphone with the SIM cards of another service provider. This guarantees that the Vivo X Flip device is only being used with the original SIM card for each provider. This locking also has a lot of drawbacks because it is incompatible with any other SIM card.

1. The phone cannot be used with other SIM cards if the SIM lock is enabled. Customers must therefore adhere to the current plan as is.
2. Since nobody wants to purchase a locked phone, it is hard for someone to sell or gift the mobile.
3. Traveling abroad with a SIM-locked phone could provide some challenges because you won't be able to use a local SIM card on the phone while you're there.

All the problems can be fixed, and the SIM works in any nation with the removed SIM lock.

### Conclusion

Any of the methods above can work to get around the prohibition against using other SIM cards with your Android handset. The best thing about using Dr.Fone-Screen Unlock is that you don't need unlocking codes to complete the tasks.

## Part 3. Benefits of Using Android SIM Unlock Code Generator

There are several benefits of using Android SIM unlock code generator. Some of these benefits are:

- **1\. Freedom to choose your carrier**

When your phone is carrier locked, you are limited to using only the carrier that the phone is locked to. This can be a problem if you travel frequently or want to switch to a different carrier. By unlocking your phone's SIM card, you will be able to use any carrier's SIM card, giving you the freedom to choose the carrier that best suits your needs.

- **2\. Cost savings**

By unlocking your phone's SIM card, you can save money on roaming charges when traveling. Instead of paying expensive roaming charges, you can simply purchase a local SIM card and use it in your unlocked phone. This can save you a lot of money in the long run.

- **3\. Resale value**

An unlocked phone has a higher resale value than a carrier-locked phone. This is because an unlocked phone can be used with any carrier's SIM card, making it more attractive to buyers.

- **4\. No need to buy a new phone**

If you want to switch to a different carrier, you may be tempted to buy a new phone that is compatible with that carrier. However, by unlocking your phone's SIM card, you can use your existing phone with any carrier's SIM card, saving you the cost of buying a new phone.

Remember, each carrier has its policies and procedures regarding unlocking. Consult your carrier’s official website or contact customer support for specific instructions and eligibility requirements.
