## Three Ways to Sim Unlock Samsung Galaxy F04

You probably purchased your Samsung Galaxy F04 for a significant discount but are now stuck with the same network for a couple of years. You loved the Samsung Galaxy F04 device but your network provider does not have any plans that exactly suit your needs. To release your device from your current network's clutches, you will need to unlock your phone.

There are three ways you can do it and this post will go through each method so that you can find one that you are most comfortable with. Do note that if your contract has ended with your network provider, this "How to unlock Samsung Galaxy F04" post can be skipped as you can just ask them to unlock your phone or purchase a [sim network unlock pin](https://drfone.wondershare.com/unlock/unlock-samsung-sim-network-unlock-pin.html) for a minimal price.

## Part 1: Samsung Galaxy F04 Unlock Code

This is probably the easiest, no-fuss method to [sim unlock](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/unlock-android-screen/) Samsung Galaxy F04. Follow these steps carefully to successfully perform Samsung Galaxy F04 unlock code.
