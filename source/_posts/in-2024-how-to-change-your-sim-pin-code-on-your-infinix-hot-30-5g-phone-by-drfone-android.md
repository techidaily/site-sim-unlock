## How To Change Your SIM PIN Code on Your Infinix Hot 30 5G Phone

When you get a new SIM card, it usually comes with a default PIN (Personal Identity Number) code printed on the packaging, documentation, or back of the SIM card. This 4-digit code protects your phone number from unauthorized calls, texts, and data use. It’s essential to change the default PIN to one that’s both memorable for you and difficult for others to guess.

So, **how to change the PIN on an Android phone**’s SIM card? This article will provide a step-by-step guide to help you secure your data. But first, let’s explore why changing the default one is important.

## Part 1: Why Does Changing Your SIM PIN Code Matter on a New Phone?

Your SIM PIN code acts as a password for your SIM card, which stores your phone number, contacts, and other essential data. Unlike the PIN you use to unlock your phone, the SIM PIN code is a separate layer of security. If someone tries to use your SIM card in another phone without the correct PIN, they won’t be able to access your network or data.

Here are more reasons why **changing the PIN code of a SIM card** is a smart move:

- Default PINs are easy to guess

Most carriers use generic PINs like “1234” or “0000”. Change it to something unique and harder to crack.

- Protects data in case of loss or theft

If you lose your phone or it gets stolen, a strong PIN code hinders the thief’s ability to make calls, send messages, or access your data stored on the SIM. It buys you time to report the loss and block your SIM card before they can do any damage.

![sim card locked](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/02/how-to-change-pin-on-android-phone-02.jpg)

- Prevents accidental PIN lockouts

Using a memorable PIN minimizes the risk of accidentally locking yourself out of your SIM card.

- Peace of mind

It is crucial if you store sensitive info on your SIM or use your phone for work. Knowing about this extra safeguard is reassuring, ensuring your data stays protected.

**Remember:**

Choose a PIN code for your SIM that’s easy for you to remember but challenging for others to guess. Avoid using birthdays, anniversaries, or other easily identifiable information. By taking a few minutes to **change the PIN code of the SIM card**, you’ll gain a significant security advantage for your new phone and data.

## Part 2: How To Change Pin on Android Phone SIM Cards?

Keeping your SIM card secure is crucial for protecting your data and privacy. Thankfully, Android allows you to easily change your SIM card PIN to a more personal and memorable code. But before you begin:

- Contact your network carrier to get your PUK code if you already have it. You’ll need this if you enter the wrong PIN three times and lock your SIM card.
- Remember the temporary default PIN: Most SIM cards have a default PIN, often 1234 or 0123. If you haven’t changed it, this is the PIN you’ll use initially.

**Note:**

Entering the wrong PIN three times will lock your SIM card. You’ll need your network carrier’s PUK code to unlock it. Use it cautiously, as exceeding the maximum number of attempts will permanently block your SIM card. So, it’s best to memorize your PIN or store it securely to avoid relying on the PUK altogether.

Steps To Change Your SIM PIN

Here’s **how to find and manage the SIM PIN code on Android**:

- **Step 1:** Navigate to your phone’s **Settings** app. Next, look for the **Security and privacy** or **Lock screen and security** (or other similar option) depending on your device’s model.
- **Step 2:** Scroll down and tap on **More security settings** or **Other security settings**.
- **Step 3:** Tap **SIM card security** or **Set up SIM card lock** (or something similar).

![sim card security in settings](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/02/how-to-change-pin-on-android-phone-03.jpg)

- **Step 4:** If you have multiple SIMs, select the one you want to change the PIN code.
- **Step 5:** Tap **Change SIM PIN**.

![change sim pin code on android](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/02/how-to-change-pin-on-android-phone-04.jpg)

- **Step 6:** Input your current SIM card PIN code and tap **OK**.

![enter old sim pin](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/02/how-to-change-pin-on-android-phone-05.jpg)

- **Step 7:** Enter your desired new PIN code and tap **OK**.
- **Step 8:** Re-enter your new SIM card PIN code and tap **OK** to confirm.

Success! You’ve successfully **changed the PIN code of your SIM card**. Remember your new PIN for future use.

## Part 3: What To Do if You Forgot or Lost an iOS Device’s SIM PIN Code?

If you’re an Android user, changing your SIM PIN is easy. But for iPhone users, forgetting it can lock you out. So, what should you do if you **lose the SIM PIN** code on iOS?

First, avoid guessing your SIM PIN or PUK code. Every wrong guess increases the risk of permanently locking your SIM card, requiring a replacement. If you forget your PIN, contact your network carrier for help. They can usually unlock your SIM with the default PIN or PUK code. If that fails, you can request a new SIM card.

However, there might also be situations where you’re locked out due to a carrier-restricted SIM card. If a quick resolution is important or you want to keep your current SIM card, consider using [Wondershare Dr.Fone](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/drfone-toolkit/).

## Part 1: Why Is Your Infinix Hot 30 5G Asking for a SIM Network Unlock PIN?

You just bought a new phone, excited to use it with a new SIM card. But your phone pops up with a request for a PIN code to unlock it. What’s that all about, and what do you enter? There are two main reasons why your phone might be asking for a SIM PIN or unlock code:

SIM Network Lock

The SIM Network Lock is a restriction placed by your phone’s original network provider, locking it to their network. It means you can only use the Infinix Hot 30 5G device with SIM cards from that specific carrier. Carriers use this to ensure that the phones they sell work only with their service. When you buy a subsidized phone, they want to ensure you stick around for the contract duration.

If you insert a SIM card from a different carrier, your phone will ask for a **SIM Network Unlock PIN** or Network Unlock Code (NUC). You’ll learn more about it in the upcoming sections of this article.

SIM Card Lock

SIM Card Lock is a security feature that protects your SIM card from unauthorized use on other devices. It requires you to enter a PIN (Personal Identification Number) to unlock the SIM card before you can use it.

The default PIN is usually printed on the back of the SIM card or its packaging. If you haven’t changed your PIN, use the 4-8 digit code provided by the carrier when you get your SIM card.

![sim card lock pin](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/02/sim-network-unlock-pin-02.jpg)

If you’ve forgotten the **SIM PIN code**, you can use the PUK (PIN Unlock Key) code to unlock the SIM and set a new PIN. The PUK code is also printed on the SIM card packaging, but be careful, as entering the wrong PUK code too many times can permanently lock the SIM card.

Not knowing the **SIM unlock PIN** code can be frustrating, especially if you want to switch mobile carriers. So, in the next part, we’ll explore whether it’s possible to unlock a SIM network-locked iPhone device.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
## Part 2: Can a SIM Network Locked iPhone Be Unlocked?

Yes, a SIM network-locked iPhone can be unlocked by your network provider. Insert a new SIM card, and you’ll be prompted to enter the **SIM Network Unlock PIN**. After inputting the correct unlock code, your iPhone is ready to use with any carrier.

![sim not valid message on iphone](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/02/sim-network-unlock-pin-03.jpg)

If you are thinking about unlocking your iPhone, it’s crucial to grasp what a **SIM Network Unlock PIN** is and how it functions.

## Part 3: What Is a SIM Network Unlock PIN?

A **SIM network unlock PIN** is a code allowing you to remove your phone’s network lock. It means you can use your phone with a SIM card from any compatible network provider, not just the one you originally bought it from. It is also known as Network Unlock PIN (NUP), Network Control Key (NCK), or Network Unlock Code (NUC).

Unlocking your device can be useful if you:

- Bought a phone locked to a specific carrier and want to switch to a different one.
- Are planning a trip abroad and want to use a local SIM card instead.

![international travel illustration](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/02/sim-network-unlock-pin-04.jpg)

- Still haven’t finished your contract with your original carrier and want to keep the phone but use a different service.
- Bought a phone second-hand locked to the previous owner’s network.
- Want to increase your phone’s resale value; unlocked phones generally have a higher resale value than locked phones, as various buyers can use them.
- Want more carrier flexibility; you are not tied to one carrier and can choose the provider that best suits your needs in terms of price, coverage, data plans, and other features.

Things To Consider

Before you proceed, here are some key points to remember:

- Eligibility: Not all phones are eligible for network unlocking. Check with your carrier or manufacturer for details.
- Costs: While some carriers can give **SIM network unlock PIN for free**, others may charge a fee. Third-party unlocking services also typically charge a fee.
- Waiting time: It can take days or even weeks to receive your **SIM unlock PIN**code from your carrier and process it. For instance, Vodafone usually unlocks the Infinix Hot 30 5G device within 72 hours to 10 days if they have to reach the manufacturer.
- Risks: Using an unauthorized unlocking method could damage your phone or void its warranty.
- Backup: Before unlocking your phone, back up your data, as the process may erase it.

Now that you understand **SIM Network Unlock PIN**, let’s get down to business! In the final part, we’ll guide you through the two ways of unlocking your iPhone for a new carrier.

It is really irritating when you realize that Infinix Hot 30 5G phone is locked to a specific network. When you travel to another country, your phone becomes useless – you can’t use a foreign sim card. If your Infinix Hot 30 5G phone is locked to a network and want to switch to a different provider, you are out of luck.

Thankfully, there are a few easy ways to unlock your Infinix Hot 30 5G phone with free Infinix unlock codes. In this article, we review and explain 4 different websites that offer free unlock codes for Infinix Hot 30 5G phones. Read ahead and learn how you can use four Infinix unlock code websites.

## Part 1: SIM Unlock Service

SIM Unlock Service is one of the best and trust-worthy SIM unlock code generators available on the market. This is not a free option, but it is so effective that many users find it is worth the price. It saves you so much hassle that it is worth the small upfront fee. Doctorsim will permanently unlock your phone, enabling you to use your phone on all carriers around the world. Most importantly, using DoctorSim will not void your warranty.

### How to use DoctorSim SIM Unlock Service to unlock Infinix Hot 30 5G phones?

Step 1. Go to [DoctorSim's official website](https://www.doctorsim.com/libtrkafl.html?pc=43d47c30d945bcbd7d9527f4049f649a&refe=https://www.doctorsim.com/us-en/?scp&euro), so you know that you can trust it. Click on the ‘Select Your Infinix Hot 30 5G’ button, and then select Infinix from the list of brands.

Step 2. Fill in your phone’s information and your contact details in the following window, including the phone IMEI, phone model, and your email.

### How to use the Unlockitfree.com Unlock Service?

1\. First, enter your phone’s unique IMEI into the site, and then the site checks to ensure that it is genuine.

2\. Choose your phone model from the list provided, and then choose your country. Once you choose your country, a list of supported Service Providers will pop up. Choose your service provider, read the terms and conditions and accept. At this point, click Generate.

3\. The Unlockitfree Generator will show you a series of 7 different unlocking codes. Not all of these will work; usually the best options are the 1st and 7th code on the list.

4\. Without removing your SIM card, input these codes into your phone’s Home screen.

Hopefully you will have success – although, this is not guaranteed (as it is with the first Dr.Fone option above).
