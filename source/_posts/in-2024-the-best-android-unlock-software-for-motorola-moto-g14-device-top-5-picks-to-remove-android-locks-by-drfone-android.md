An unlocked phone has a higher resale value than a carrier-locked phone. This is because an unlocked phone can be used with any carrier's SIM card, making it more attractive to buyers.

- **4\. No need to buy a new phone**

If you want to switch to a different carrier, you may be tempted to buy a new phone that is compatible with that carrier. However, by unlocking your phone's SIM card, you can use your existing phone with any carrier's SIM card, saving you the cost of buying a new phone.
