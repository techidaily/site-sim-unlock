## Part 1: What Should You Do Before Apple iPhone 12 mini SIM Unlock?

Before unlocking your Apple iPhone 12 mini from the carrier, you should fulfill the following criteria.

### 1\. No Due Before Unlocking

When iPhone users sign contracts with a giant cell phone company for a certain amount of time, they often get a discount on a device. Because of this, the Apple iPhone 12 mini device comes with a controller lock so customers can only use it on their network.

So, if you've paid off your contract or bought your Apple iPhone 12 mini without a subsidy, it's perfectly legal to unlock it. But if you're still paying off your contract, you still need to own the Apple iPhone 12 mini fully, so you should confirm with your carrier before unlocking it.

### 2\. You Should Buy It for More Than the Time Limit in the Contract

You can leave without paying anything if your agreement with the company is over. If you signed a contract in exchange for a lower price upfront, you would have to wait until your contract ended (usually 24 months) or pay the remaining balance if you bought your phone on a payment plan.

### Examples: Requirements of Sim Unlock of T-Mobile/EE/AT&T

T-Mobile, EE, and AT&T have common requirements before you can unlock your Apple iPhone 12 mini.

- Your bank account shouldn't have any debts.
- If you signed a contract in exchange for a lower price upfront, you would have to wait until your contract was up (usually 24 months) or pay the remaining balance if you bought your phone on a payment plan.
