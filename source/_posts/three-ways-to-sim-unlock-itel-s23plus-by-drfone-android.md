## Three Ways to Sim Unlock Itel S23+

You probably purchased your Itel S23+ for a significant discount but are now stuck with the same network for a couple of years. You loved the Itel S23+ device but your network provider does not have any plans that exactly suit your needs. To release your device from your current network's clutches, you will need to unlock your phone.

There are three ways you can do it and this post will go through each method so that you can find one that you are most comfortable with. Do note that if your contract has ended with your network provider, this "How to unlock Itel S23+" post can be skipped as you can just ask them to unlock your phone or purchase a [sim network unlock pin](https://drfone.wondershare.com/unlock/unlock-samsung-sim-network-unlock-pin.html) for a minimal price.

## Part 1: Itel S23+ Unlock Code

This is probably the easiest, no-fuss method to [sim unlock](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/unlock-android-screen/) Itel S23+. Follow these steps carefully to successfully perform Itel S23+ unlock code.

Do take note that this process may not work with your carrier. Therefore, always check if this is the right way to obtain the necessary code:

## Part 6: The downside of an unlocked Itel S23+

Are you thinking "Well, why can't I just buy an unlocked Itel S23+ in the first place?" right about now? Well, you can but think of the amount of money it will cost you.

For example, in Australia, an unlocked Itel S23+ will cost around $499 from any Itel outlet but $0 for the Itel S23+ device when you pair it with a 24-month postpaid plan. While this may look attractive now, you may be paying more for a locked Itel S23+ in the long run.
