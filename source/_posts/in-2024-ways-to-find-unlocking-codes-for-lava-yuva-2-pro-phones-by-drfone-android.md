## Ways To Find Unlocking Codes For Lava Yuva 2 Pro Phones

When you have a locked device, it is pretty much impossible to move from one network to another. This would cause problems if for instance you wanted to travel outside the country and want to switch to that country's carrier for the duration of your stay. Or maybe you just want to switch carriers because you don't like your current provider.

Whatever the reason, you should be able to unlock your device easily. But this has often proven difficult because of the fact that you need unlock codes. The problem is that many sites promise free unlocking codes for your device and many turn out to be fraudulent sites that use the word "free" in their advertising but actually require you to pay for the service. If you have been unsuccessfully searching for free unlocking codes for your device, look no further. This article compiles three of the best for Android and iPhone.

![ways to find unlocking codes-Unlock it Free](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2016/06/14670152348544.jpg)

In the next window, you will be required to enter your IMEI number, phone model, country and provider. You can get your IMEI number by dialling \*#06# on your device.

Once you have entered all the details correctly click "Generate" and the website will give you seven different codes to unlock your device.

![ways to find unlocking codes-click](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2016/06/14670152532630.jpg)

Use the first one. If it fails to work, try the last code. 80% of people unlock their devices with either the first or the last code. Of this doesn't work either, try 2 more. But don't enter more than 4 codes as this will disable your device.

### 2\. Trycktill

## Three Ways to Sim Unlock Lava Yuva 2 Pro

You probably purchased your Lava Yuva 2 Pro for a significant discount but are now stuck with the same network for a couple of years. You loved the Lava Yuva 2 Pro device but your network provider does not have any plans that exactly suit your needs. To release your device from your current network's clutches, you will need to unlock your phone.

There are three ways you can do it and this post will go through each method so that you can find one that you are most comfortable with. Do note that if your contract has ended with your network provider, this "How to unlock Lava Yuva 2 Pro" post can be skipped as you can just ask them to unlock your phone or purchase a [sim network unlock pin](https://drfone.wondershare.com/unlock/unlock-samsung-sim-network-unlock-pin.html) for a minimal price.

## Part 1: Lava Yuva 2 Pro Unlock Code

This is probably the easiest, no-fuss method to [sim unlock](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/unlock-android-screen/) Lava Yuva 2 Pro. Follow these steps carefully to successfully perform Lava Yuva 2 Pro unlock code.

Do take note that this process may not work with your carrier. Therefore, always check if this is the right way to obtain the necessary code:

- 1\. Check the SIM lock status---you can do this by dialing **\*#\*#7378423#\*#\***.

![unlock code sony xperia](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2016/08/14707989597664.jpg)

1. Get a new SIM card from a new carrier.
2. Call your carrier's customer service line and ask what are the requirements to qualify you to get your Lava Yuva 2 Pro unlocked. If you have honored your contract, there should not be any problems. However, do ask your carrier if there are any additional requirements. Do note that there may be fees involved.
3. Once your customer service representative has determined if you have met all their requirements, they should give you the SIM network unlock PIN Lava Yuva 2 Pro. Again, depending on your carrier, they might either give you the code over the phone, through email or via SMS.

Prepaid plans are always changing in terms of offering so having the flexibility of changing carriers and prepaid plans can help you save money in the long run.

## Part 6: The downside of an unlocked Lava Yuva 2 Pro

Are you thinking "Well, why can't I just buy an unlocked Lava Yuva 2 Pro in the first place?" right about now? Well, you can but think of the amount of money it will cost you.

For example, in Australia, an unlocked Lava Yuva 2 Pro will cost around $499 from any Lava outlet but $0 for the Lava Yuva 2 Pro device when you pair it with a 24-month postpaid plan. While this may look attractive now, you may be paying more for a locked Lava Yuva 2 Pro in the long run.

## Conclusion

Now that you know the three ways of unlocking your Lava Yuva 2 Pro, all you need to do is find one that is most compatible with you. Just remember to think of everything through and carefully. Most importantly, if you have a locked device, always seek advice from your carrier to see if this is possible.

Website URL: [https://www.unlockbase.com/wholesale-phone-unlocking](https://www.unlockbase.com/wholesale-phone-unlocking)

This service will unlock almost all devices, both Android and iPhone. It is also very fast and reliable. But perhaps the best feature of this service is that you can be aware of just how much you will have to spend to unlock your device long before you place the order.

To use the service, simply go to the main home page and check on the table provided how long it will take for your device to be unlocked and how much you have to pay. If you are happy with both estimates. Choose to unlock from the main menu and then proceed to select your device.

Once you have selected the Lava Yuva 2 Pro device, enter the IMEI code, your email address, your country, and the network you are on. Then click on "Proceed to check out". Make payment and then wait for the assigned time for the [sim network unlock pin](https://drfone.wondershare.com/unlock/unlock-samsung-sim-network-unlock-pin.html) to be sent to the email address you provided.
