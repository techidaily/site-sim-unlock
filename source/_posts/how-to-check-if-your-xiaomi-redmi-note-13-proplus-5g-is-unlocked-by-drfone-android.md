### Method 2: Unlocking With Your Carrier’s Official Methods

As mentioned earlier, carriers often provide official routes to unlock their devices. While typically requiring compliance with specific criteria, this method ensures you stay within your carrier’s policies.

Most carriers offer two common methods for unlocking their phones:

- **Paying an upfront fee.**If your contract period is still ongoing, certain carriers allow unlocking upon payment of a predetermined fee. Check your carrier’s website or contact customer support for eligibility and fee details.
- **Requesting a SIM unlock.**Once your contract has expired and you meet the carrier’s eligibility criteria (e.g., device payment completion), you can submit an official unlock request. Carriers typically have dedicated online portals or customer service channels for this process.

Remember, each carrier has its policies and procedures regarding unlocking. Consult your carrier’s official website or contact customer support for specific instructions and eligibility requirements.

## Conclusion

Navigating the world of phone locks and restrictions can be daunting, but with the right information, you can unlock your device’s full potential. Of course, this guide taught you **how to check if your phone is unlocked** or not. Further, it taught you how to unlock it through official carrier channels or a trustworthy third-party tool like Wondershare Dr.Fone.

## Part 6: The downside of an unlocked Xiaomi Redmi Note 13 Pro+ 5G

Are you thinking "Well, why can't I just buy an unlocked Xiaomi Redmi Note 13 Pro+ 5G in the first place?" right about now? Well, you can but think of the amount of money it will cost you.

For example, in Australia, an unlocked Xiaomi Redmi Note 13 Pro+ 5G will cost around $499 from any Xiaomi outlet but $0 for the Xiaomi Redmi Note 13 Pro+ 5G device when you pair it with a 24-month postpaid plan. While this may look attractive now, you may be paying more for a locked Xiaomi Redmi Note 13 Pro+ 5G in the long run.

Unlocking a phone means making it compatible with other SIM carriers. An unlocked phone is not pinned to a single SIM carrier; rather, it lets you switch carriers. SIM Card lets your phone connect to a specific network, but it depends on your phone's hardware compatibility. If it's not compatible with a specific network, then nothing can change that.

To unlock your phone, you have to enter a specific code to remove the restrictions of the network. However, there are ways to unlock your phone without granting permission from the network.

### Rooting (for Android)

![androi root](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/09/root-android.jpg)

[Rooting a phone](https://drfone.wondershare.com/root/reasons-to-root-android.html) means gaining “root access” on another phone. **This process works for Android only.** However, it can also be used on some specific Linux-based devices. Root access allows you to do almost everything on the phone you’ve gained access to, like installing or uninstalling applications or changing the settings.

Root access is not all fun, and games as this process will lead you to the security architect of your operating system, which will be hard to deal with even if you're a professional. So, it’s important to be careful with this process, else you will have to bear the consequences.

### Jailbreaking (for iOS)

![iphone Jailbreak](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/09/iphone-jailbreak.jpg)

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
[Jailbreaking a device](https://drfone.wondershare.com/guide/how-to-jailbreak-ios-on-windows.html) means removing all the restrictions on that device that its manufacturer's applied. **This process works specifically for Apple devices.** It lets you bypass the limitations and restrictions, so you can modify the software your way and make changes to the default program. It is also considered free booting, and Apple or any other company does not approve of it.

In summary, unlocking is primarily about freeing a device from carrier restrictions, rooting is specific to Android devices and involves gaining administrative access, while jailbreaking is specific to iOS devices and involves bypassing Apple's restrictions for more customization. All these processes come with potential risks and may void warranties, so users should carefully consider the implications before proceeding.

It is advisable to always go for the safest method, unlocking your phone. Rooting and Jailbreaking are risky security exploitations that can cause serious problems.
