The following are the procedures for unlocking Boost phones in different scenarios

A military account number is allowed for unlocking up to 2 devices in a year.

### Unlocking Boost Phone for current existing Boost customers

If you are a current customer of Boost and meet all the unlocking eligibility criteria then the process to get your device to unlock involves the following steps.

Step 1. Call the Boost customer service contact number.

Step 2. You will be provided with a **Boost mobile network unlock code**.

Step 3. You need to input the provided code and your device will be unlocked.

Note: For the BoostUP! For installment plan holders, the **Boost Mobile unlock Sim card** process will be done in a day while for the others it might take around 2 days.

A few points that need to be taken care of during the unlocking process are as follows:

- Ensure that your SIM card is in your phone else if you replace or remove the SIM card, your unlocking request might fail.
- Also, make sure that your device during the phase is turned on and is also connected with the Boost Mobile Network or to a WiFi network.

Unlocking phones for the Non-Boost Customers

If you are currently not a Boost customer and have been a customer earlier or have never been a customer and have purchased from a previous owner, you can still get your phone unlocked, though the process becomes a little complicated and the following are the requirements.

- You would need a Boost mobile number or an account number that was last associated with the Apple iPhone XR device.
- In case you do not have the number, then you will have to get in touch with the previous owner and get these details.

And in case you do not meet either of the above two situations, **Boost mobile carrier unlock** on your device cannot be done and you will first need to use the Boost network for the required time and get yourself eligible for the unlocking process.

_**Tip**: Another important point to consider before buying a device from a third party is to check with the Boost Mobile if the phone is unlocked or if it is eligible. In case you come to know that your device cannot be unlocked, you will not have to worry about the eligibility criteria or requirements._

## How Do I SIM Unlock My Apple iPhone XR?

If your Apple iPhone XR is locked to a particular carrier, it can be very frustrating. This is because your device will only be able to work with a SIM card from that provider and no other. This can be a problem when you want to change carriers. Some iPhones are generally easier to unlock than others, and the easiest way to unlock any iPhone is usually to use a paid online service. The issue is that these services can be very expensive.

In this article, we are going to look at how you can [sim unlock](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/unlock-android-screen/) your Apple iPhone XR. It is however important to note that if you purchased your device in the last one year, it is already unlocked.

Many people may wonder whether it is legal to unlock the iPhone. Actually, it is perfectly legal to unlock your Apple iPhone XR if you have completed payments on the contract, or you bought the Apple iPhone XR device outright. If however, you are still in the process of paying for your contract, you don't fully own the phone and so you should contact the carrier before unlocking it.

But if your Apple iPhone XR has [bad ESN](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/iphone-unlock/) or been blacklisted by the carrier, you can check the new post here to check what to do if you have a [blacklisted iPhone](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/iphone-unlock/).

##  Part 1: How to SIM Unlock Your Apple iPhone XR?

There are several ways to unlock your device. Let's look at a few of them.

### 1\. Contact your Carrier and Have them unlock the Apple iPhone XR device for you

This is probably the safest way to do it. If you have already completed payments on your Apple iPhone XR or you bought it outright, you can ask your carrier for the [sim network unlock pin](https://drfone.wondershare.com/unlock/unlock-samsung-sim-network-unlock-pin.html) to unlock your device. Depending on your carrier, you may have to pay for this service, and it also does take up to 7 days, sometimes more for them to get back to you.

### 2\. Software Unlocking

This is where you download a piece of [sim network unlock pin software](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/unlock-android-screen/) on to your device. This software makes changes to the Apple iPhone XR device, allowing you to make calls from any carrier. While this may sound straight-forward and easy, except it is highly risky and will not work for iPhone 4 and later models.

### 3\. Hardware Unlocking

This is where you alter the hardware of the Apple iPhone XR device to create an alternate path to deliver calls. Although this can be done, it also alters your device irreparably and probably also voids your warranty. Not to mention, you may pay more than $200 to have the Apple iPhone XR device unlocked in this way.

### 4\. IMEI unlocking

This is the best way to unlock your device and by far the easiest. This method uses your device's IMEI number to access the IMEI database and change the status of the Apple iPhone XR from locked to unlocked. There are very many services that you can use to IMEI unlock your device, and most of them will offer the service for a fee. But this is a great solution because there is no software to download, and you don't mess with the hardware in any way.

### Steps on How to Unlock Your Apple iPhone XR via IMEI

Like we mentioned before, there are a lot of services you can use to unlock your Apple iPhone XR. One of the best is [iPhoneIMEI.net](https://appleiphoneunlock.uk/network/Special%20Services/Activation%20Lock?aff=wondershare). This website helps you unlock the Apple iPhone XR in an official way, and it promises that the unlocked iPhone will not be relooked again. In this tutorial, we are going to use this website to show you how easy it is to unlock your Apple iPhone XR using your IMEI number.

Step 1: On your browser, navigate to [iPhoneIMEI.net](https://appleiphoneunlock.uk/network/Special%20Services/Activation%20Lock?aff=wondershare) from the home page. Select your Apple iPhone XR model and the network provider the phone is locked to. Then click on Unlock.

![sim unlock iphone with iphoneimei.net](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/03/apple-iphone-unlock.png)

Step 2: Next, you will be required to enter your IMEI number and get details of the price and how long it will take for the code to be generated. Click on “Unlock Now” and you will be sent to a payment page where you can complete the payment.

Step 3. After the payment is successful, the system will send your Apple iPhone XR IMEI to the network provider and whitelist it from Apple activation database (You will be received an email for this change). This step may take 1–5 days.

After the phone is successfully unlocked, you will get email notification too. When you see that email, just simply connect your Apple iPhone XR to a Wi-Fi network and insert any SIM card, your Apple iPhone XR should work instantly!

## Part 2: The Best SIM Unlock Service - Dr.Fone

A SIM unlock PIN is an effective way to remove your SIM lock effectively. However, it may not work sometimes.

If your Apple iPhone XR is X/8(Plus)/7(Plus)/SE/6S(Plus)/6(Plus)/5S, luckily, I will introduce an amazing software to help unlock your SIM card permanently.

### 1\. No Due Before Unlocking

When iPhone users sign contracts with a giant cell phone company for a certain amount of time, they often get a discount on a device. Because of this, the Apple iPhone XR device comes with a controller lock so customers can only use it on their network.

So, if you've paid off your contract or bought your Apple iPhone XR without a subsidy, it's perfectly legal to unlock it. But if you're still paying off your contract, you still need to own the Apple iPhone XR fully, so you should confirm with your carrier before unlocking it.

### 2\. You Should Buy It for More Than the Time Limit in the Contract

You can leave without paying anything if your agreement with the company is over. If you signed a contract in exchange for a lower price upfront, you would have to wait until your contract ended (usually 24 months) or pay the remaining balance if you bought your phone on a payment plan.

### Examples: Requirements of Sim Unlock of T-Mobile/EE/AT&T

T-Mobile, EE, and AT&T have common requirements before you can unlock your Apple iPhone XR.

- It has to be legal. It means the Apple iPhone XR device has not been reported as lost, stolen, or linked to a crime.
- Your bank account shouldn't have any debts.
- If you signed a contract in exchange for a lower price upfront, you would have to wait until your contract was up (usually 24 months) or pay the remaining balance if you bought your phone on a payment plan.

Apart from the requirements mentioned above, each company has its way of unlocking.

**T-Mobile**

![t mobile](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/12/unlock-iphone-x-1.jpg)

Following are the unlocking requirements of T-Mobile.

- In the past year, fewer than two SIM unlock codes have been asked for on each individual.
- The device had been connected to the T-Mobile network for at least 40 days before the request to unlock it was made.
- You have a service contract and have paid for at least 18 months in a row, or you paid a fee for moving. Customer Service can tell you more about a few special situations if you need to.
- The phone's prepaid plan must have at least $50 worth of recharges paid for.
- If you meet the above requirements, you can call customer service at 611 from the Apple iPhone XR device you want to unlock to unlock an iPhone 11 or 12 that is locked to a T-Mobile network.
- When you call about tips, make sure you have ALL of the following:

1. The main account holder's phone number
2. Account Password
3. Account holder's SSN's last four digits
4. IMEI number. You can find this by navigating Settings > General > About or dialing \*#06#.

**AT&T**

## Part 2: 2 Ways to Remove SIM Lock on Apple iPhone XR

### Way 1: Contact Your Carrier for Apple iPhone XR SIM Unlock

So, if you fulfill the above requirements, you can contact your carrier and request them to unlock your sim Lock restriction. Follow the steps below to contact your carrier.

**Get the IMEI code on your phone.**

First of all, get the IMEI code on your Apple iPhone XR. The serial number and the IMEI number are the same things. You can find it on the original box, on the back of some models, under the battery, by dialing #06 or going to Settings > General > About.

![general](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/12/unlock-iphone-x-4.jpg)

![imei in about](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/12/unlock-iphone-x-5.jpg)

**Contact the service provider for unlock request.**

Now you have to contact the service provider for an unlocking request. For this, Go to the official site of your service provider and send them an unlocking request or call on their helpline. They will ask you for the IMEI number of your Apple iPhone XR and then guide you through the different processes. The unlocking request may take a few days.

**If all goes well, you can get the unlock code.**

After receiving the unlocking request, the company will pass the request through all the parameters. If everything goes according to company policy, the company will e-mail an unlock code. You will have to enter the code into your mobile.

**Insert the SIM card from the new carrier and enter the unlock code**

The unlock code may be 8 to 16 digits long. Follow the steps to enter unlock code.
