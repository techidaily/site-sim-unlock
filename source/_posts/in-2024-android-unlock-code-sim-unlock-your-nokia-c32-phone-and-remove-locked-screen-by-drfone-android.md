## Android Unlock Code: Sim Unlock Your Nokia C32 Phone and Remove Locked Screen

When you buy a phone, your matter of concern is whether to buy a locked phone or an unlocked Phone. Locked phones may look much safer to you, but they are very inconvenient when it comes to normal use. These phones are bound to one carrier only, which is their biggest disadvantage. At the same time, unlocked phones save you from this hassle.

If you’ve bought a locked phone and facing problems, you need not worry as there are multiple ways to unlock your phone. For that, this article has provided the solution to your issue in the most intelligible way.

## Part 1: Difference between Unlocking, Rooting, and Jailbreaking

This part of the article shall differ from three very similar terms, Unlocking, Rooting, and Jailbreaking, to clear your confusion.

### Unlocking

![sim unlock](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/09/sim-unlock.jpg)

Unlocking a phone means making it compatible with other SIM carriers. An unlocked phone is not pinned to a single SIM carrier; rather, it lets you switch carriers. SIM Card lets your phone connect to a specific network, but it depends on your phone's hardware compatibility. If it's not compatible with a specific network, then nothing can change that.

To unlock your phone, you have to enter a specific code to remove the restrictions of the network. However, there are ways to unlock your phone without granting permission from the network.

### Rooting (for Android)

![androi root](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/09/root-android.jpg)

[Rooting a phone](https://drfone.wondershare.com/root/reasons-to-root-android.html) means gaining “root access” on another phone. **This process works for Android only.** However, it can also be used on some specific Linux-based devices. Root access allows you to do almost everything on the phone you’ve gained access to, like installing or uninstalling applications or changing the settings.

Root access is not all fun, and games as this process will lead you to the security architect of your operating system, which will be hard to deal with even if you're a professional. So, it’s important to be careful with this process, else you will have to bear the consequences.

### Jailbreaking (for iOS)

![iphone Jailbreak](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/09/iphone-jailbreak.jpg)

[Jailbreaking a device](https://drfone.wondershare.com/guide/how-to-jailbreak-ios-on-windows.html) means removing all the restrictions on that device that its manufacturer's applied. **This process works specifically for Apple devices.** It lets you bypass the limitations and restrictions, so you can modify the software your way and make changes to the default program. It is also considered free booting, and Apple or any other company does not approve of it.

In summary, unlocking is primarily about freeing a device from carrier restrictions, rooting is specific to Android devices and involves gaining administrative access, while jailbreaking is specific to iOS devices and involves bypassing Apple's restrictions for more customization. All these processes come with potential risks and may void warranties, so users should carefully consider the implications before proceeding.

It is advisable to always go for the safest method, unlocking your phone. Rooting and Jailbreaking are risky security exploitations that can cause serious problems.

## Part 2: Is it Legally Allowed to Unlock Your Nokia C32?

Every country has its own rules and regulations. Similarly, laws regarding unlocking your phones are different in different countries. However, after sessions of deliberations and consultations, the US has declared it legal to unlock your phone.

In order to legally unlock your phone, you must make sure your phone service contracts, payments, and dues are cleared. You must be the sole owner of your phone. Once your phone is eligible and falls under the requirements, you will be given an “Unlock Code” to proceed further.

## Part 3: Free Ways to Perform Android SIM Efficiently

## Part 5: Tip to Avoid the SIM Lock Issue

In order to avoid the SIM Lock issue, it is advisable to use unlocked phones. This will save you from long-term hassle as you will have the freedom to switch carriers and SIM cards whenever you like. On the other hand, if we talk about locked phones, they’re expensive and a headache to deal with because of the requirements and problems they come with.

If you're concerned about a dual-SIM phone, then you can have one SIM pinned to a good quality carrier. The other SIM can be temporary and cheap. This is an amazing option for you if you're traveling, as you'll have the flexibility to change carriers for the temporary SIM no matter wherever you are.

## Conclusion

As a crux, an unlocked phone is a better choice than a locked phone. We would personally advise you to go for unlocked phones as this will save your time and money. You will have much more freedom and flexibility for changing between SIM and SIM carriers. Whereas on the locked phones, you will be bound to one SIM. So, the next time you decide to buy a phone, give this article a read again.
