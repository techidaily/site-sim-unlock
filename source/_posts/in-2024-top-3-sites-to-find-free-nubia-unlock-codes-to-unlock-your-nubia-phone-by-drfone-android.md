It is really irritating when you realize that Nubia Red Magic 9 Pro+ phone is locked to a specific network.

In this article, we review and explain 4 different websites that offer free unlock codes for Nubia Red Magic 9 Pro+ phones. Read ahead and learn how you can use four Nubia unlock code websites.

## Part 1: SIM Unlock Service

SIM Unlock Service is one of the best and trust-worthy SIM unlock code generators available on the market. This is not a free option, but it is so effective that many users find it is worth the price. It saves you so much hassle that it is worth the small upfront fee. Doctorsim will permanently unlock your phone, enabling you to use your phone on all carriers around the world. Most importantly, using DoctorSim will not void your warranty.

### How to use DoctorSim SIM Unlock Service to unlock Nubia Red Magic 9 Pro+ phones?

Step 1. Go to [DoctorSim's official website](https://www.doctorsim.com/libtrkafl.html?pc=43d47c30d945bcbd7d9527f4049f649a&refe=https://www.doctorsim.com/us-en/?scp&euro), so you know that you can trust it. Click on the ‘Select Your Nubia Red Magic 9 Pro+’ button, and then select Nubia from the list of brands.

Step 2. Fill in your phone’s information and your contact details in the following window, including the phone IMEI, phone model, and your email. Once your order is processed, the system will send you your personalized unlock code and unlocking instructions. You can then follow the instructions to unlock your Nubia Red Magic 9 Pro+ phone. Easy!

## Part 2: Unlockitfree.com for free Nubia unlock codes

Unlockitfree.com is a free remote unlock service, providing unlocking codes for Nubia Red Magic 9 Pro+ phones and other models. They offer a fast and free service, but it is not always reliable.

1\. First, enter your phone’s unique IMEI into the site, and then the site checks to ensure that it is genuine.

2\. Choose your phone model from the list provided, and then choose your country. Once you choose your country, a list of supported Service Providers will pop up. Choose your service provider, read the terms and conditions and accept. At this point, click Generate.
