They are a 100% solution, especially considering they're a third-party tool which makes them less biased as they don't have an incentive to keep you from unlocking.

You can leave without paying anything if your contract with the company is over. Before you can unlock your Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max, you have to do the following:
