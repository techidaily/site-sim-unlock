## Three Ways to Sim Unlock Tecno Camon 30 Pro 5G

You probably purchased your Tecno Camon 30 Pro 5G for a significant discount but are now stuck with the same network for a couple of years. You loved the Tecno Camon 30 Pro 5G device but your network provider does not have any plans that exactly suit your needs. To release your device from your current network's clutches, you will need to unlock your phone.

There are three ways you can do it and this post will go through each method so that you can find one that you are most comfortable with. Do note that if your contract has ended with your network provider, this "How to unlock Tecno Camon 30 Pro 5G" post can be skipped as you can just ask them to unlock your phone or purchase a [sim network unlock pin](https://drfone.wondershare.com/unlock/unlock-samsung-sim-network-unlock-pin.html) for a minimal price.

## Part 1: Tecno Camon 30 Pro 5G Unlock Code

This is probably the easiest, no-fuss method to [sim unlock](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/unlock-android-screen/) Tecno Camon 30 Pro 5G. Follow these steps carefully to successfully perform Tecno Camon 30 Pro 5G unlock code.

Do take note that this process may not work with your carrier. Therefore, always check if this is the right way to obtain the necessary code:

- 1\. Check the SIM lock status---you can do this by dialing **\*#\*#7378423#\*#\***.

![sony xperia unlock code](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2016/08/14707989592943.jpg)

![unlock with sony xperia unlock code](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2016/08/14707989592897.jpg)

- 3\. The number beside **Network** indicates how many attempts you have to unlock the phone. If it says '7' it means you have seven attempts; '0' simply means it is hard locked and cannot be unlocked using this method.

![unlock code sony xperia](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2016/08/14707989597664.jpg)

- 4\. Find the **IMEI number** by dialing **\*#06#**. Jot it down as this will be your code.

![sony unlock code](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2016/08/14707998453087.jpg)

- 5\. Insert your new SIM card and tap in the IMEI number when it asks you for SIM network unlock PIN.

![sony unlock screen](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2016/08/unlock-screen.jpg)

If you have followed these steps to a tee, you should have unlocked your device. If you had to abort after Step 2, look at the other two methods below.

## Part 2: The Best Tecno Camon 30 Pro 5G SIM Unlock Code Generator

To safely and successfully sim unlock your Tecno Camon 30 Pro 5G, it is important to find a trustworthy [sim network unlock pin software](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/unlock-android-screen/). Here I am going you present to you DoctorSIM - SIM Unlock Service. It definitely is one of the best sim unlocking code generators in the market. It helps you permanently sim unlock your phone so you can use it on any carrier provider you want in the world.

### How to use SIM Unlock Service

Step 1. Visit Doctor - SIM Unlock Service official website, click on the Select Your Tecno Camon 30 Pro 5G button, and then select Tecno among all the phone brands.

Step 2. On the new window, fill in your phone IMEI number, model, your contact email, and other required information. Once your order is processed, the system will then send you the unlock code and instructions. You can follow the instruction to unlock your phone easily.

## Part 3: Tecno Camon 30 Pro 5G Unlock Carrier

If your Tecno Camon 30 Pro 5G is hard locked, this is your best bet in getting your device unlocked. Actually, it is the safest method among all three:

1. Get a new SIM card from a new carrier.
2. Call your carrier's customer service line and ask what are the requirements to qualify you to get your Tecno Camon 30 Pro 5G unlocked. If you have honored your contract, there should not be any problems. However, do ask your carrier if there are any additional requirements. Do note that there may be fees involved.
3. Once your customer service representative has determined if you have met all their requirements, they should give you the SIM network unlock PIN Tecno Camon 30 Pro 5G. Again, depending on your carrier, they might either give you the code over the phone, through email or via SMS. If you have the choice, always opt for email or SMS so that you are able to jot down the right number.
4. Once you have gotten the code, insert the new SIM card (from your new carrier). You will receive a prompt to enter your code. Make sure that you key in the right code---entering the wrong code will cause your phone to be locked (possibly forever).

## Part 5: The benefits of an unlocked Tecno Camon 30 Pro 5G

If you now know how to unlock Tecno Camon 30 Pro 5G but still do not know its advantages, we are here to help.

As indicated in the introduction, unlocked phone users can freely choose the plans they subscribed to---on any carriers, in any country. Therefore, if you travel frequently around the world, having an unlocked Tecno Camon 30 Pro 5G would be beneficial. Using a local SIM card is much cheaper than paying for exorbitant roaming charges.

You can also benefit from an unlocked Tecno Camon 30 Pro 5G if you are the kind of person who likes to take advantage of current offers provided by your local carriers. Prepaid plans are always changing in terms of offering so having the flexibility of changing carriers and prepaid plans can help you save money in the long run.

## Part 6: The downside of an unlocked Tecno Camon 30 Pro 5G

Are you thinking "Well, why can't I just buy an unlocked Tecno Camon 30 Pro 5G in the first place?" right about now? Well, you can but think of the amount of money it will cost you.

For example, in Australia, an unlocked Tecno Camon 30 Pro 5G will cost around $499 from any Tecno outlet but $0 for the Tecno Camon 30 Pro 5G device when you pair it with a 24-month postpaid plan. While this may look attractive now, you may be paying more for a locked Tecno Camon 30 Pro 5G in the long run.

## Conclusion

Now that you know the three ways of unlocking your Tecno Camon 30 Pro 5G, all you need to do is find one that is most compatible with you. Just remember to think of everything through and carefully. Most importantly, if you have a locked device, always seek advice from your carrier to see if this is possible.

## Ways To Find Unlocking Codes For Tecno Camon 30 Pro 5G Phones

When you have a locked device, it is pretty much impossible to move from one network to another. This would cause problems if for instance you wanted to travel outside the country and want to switch to that country's carrier for the duration of your stay. Or maybe you just want to switch carriers because you don't like your current provider.

Whatever the reason, you should be able to unlock your device easily. But this has often proven difficult because of the fact that you need unlock codes. The problem is that many sites promise free unlocking codes for your device and many turn out to be fraudulent sites that use the word "free" in their advertising but actually require you to pay for the service. If you have been unsuccessfully searching for free unlocking codes for your device, look no further. This article compiles three of the best for Android and iPhone.
