Download Link: [https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.unlockscope.app&hl=en](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.unlockscope.app&hl=en)

The major selling point of this app is that it supports a wide range of Android device. Using it however is not as easy as the ones we've seen above. You have to provide a lot of information about the Vivo Y27 5G device before you can be provided with the unlocking code. Also, the app charges the user per unlocking code provided. The code is sent to the user's email address which also further complicates the process.
