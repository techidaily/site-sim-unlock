## Top 3 Sites to Find Free Nokia Unlock Codes to Unlock Your Nokia Phone

[![Selena Lee](https://drfone.wondershare.com/images/selena-lee.png)](https://drfone.wondershare.com/author/selena-lee/)

It is really irritating when you realize that Nokia C02 phone is locked to a specific network. When you travel to another country, your phone becomes useless – you can’t use a foreign sim card.

Thankfully, there are a few easy ways to unlock your Nokia C02 phone with free Nokia unlock codes. In this article, we review and explain 4 different websites that offer free unlock codes for Nokia C02 phones. Read ahead and learn how you can use four Nokia unlock code websites.

## Part 1: SIM Unlock Service

SIM Unlock Service is one of the best and trust-worthy SIM unlock code generators available on the market. This is not a free option, but it is so effective that many users find it is worth the price. It saves you so much hassle that it is worth the small upfront fee. Doctorsim will permanently unlock your phone, enabling you to use your phone on all carriers around the world. Most importantly, using DoctorSim will not void your warranty.

### How to use DoctorSim SIM Unlock Service to unlock Nokia C02 phones?

Step 1. Go to [DoctorSim's official website](https://www.doctorsim.com/libtrkafl.html?pc=43d47c30d945bcbd7d9527f4049f649a&refe=https://www.doctorsim.com/us-en/?scp&euro), so you know that you can trust it. Click on the ‘Select Your Nokia C02’ button, and then select Nokia from the list of brands.

## Part 2: Unlockitfree.com for free Nokia unlock codes
