## Three Ways to Sim Unlock Tecno Pova 5

You probably purchased your Tecno Pova 5 for a significant discount but are now stuck with the same network for a couple of years. You loved the Tecno Pova 5 device but your network provider does not have any plans that exactly suit your needs. To release your device from your current network's clutches, you will need to unlock your phone.

There are three ways you can do it and this post will go through each method so that you can find one that you are most comfortable with. Do note that if your contract has ended with your network provider, this "How to unlock Tecno Pova 5" post can be skipped as you can just ask them to unlock your phone or purchase a [sim network unlock pin](https://drfone.wondershare.com/unlock/unlock-samsung-sim-network-unlock-pin.html) for a minimal price.

## Part 1: Tecno Pova 5 Unlock Code

This is probably the easiest, no-fuss method to [sim unlock](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/unlock-android-screen/) Tecno Pova 5. Follow these steps carefully to successfully perform Tecno Pova 5 unlock code.

1. Get a new SIM card from a new carrier.
2. Call your carrier's customer service line and ask what are the requirements to qualify you to get your Tecno Pova 5 unlocked. If you have honored your contract, there should not be any problems. However, do ask your carrier if there are any additional requirements. Do note that there may be fees involved.
3. Once your customer service representative has determined if you have met all their requirements, they should give you the SIM network unlock PIN Tecno Pova 5. Again, depending on your carrier, they might either give you the code over the phone, through email or via SMS.

## Part 5: The benefits of an unlocked Tecno Pova 5

If you now know how to unlock Tecno Pova 5 but still do not know its advantages, we are here to help.

As indicated in the introduction, unlocked phone users can freely choose the plans they subscribed to---on any carriers, in any country. Therefore, if you travel frequently around the world, having an unlocked Tecno Pova 5 would be beneficial. Using a local SIM card is much cheaper than paying for exorbitant roaming charges.

You can also benefit from an unlocked Tecno Pova 5 if you are the kind of person who likes to take advantage of current offers provided by your local carriers. Prepaid plans are always changing in terms of offering so having the flexibility of changing carriers and prepaid plans can help you save money in the long run.

## Part 6: The downside of an unlocked Tecno Pova 5

Are you thinking "Well, why can't I just buy an unlocked Tecno Pova 5 in the first place?" right about now? Well, you can but think of the amount of money it will cost you.

For example, in Australia, an unlocked Tecno Pova 5 will cost around $499 from any Tecno outlet but $0 for the Tecno Pova 5 device when you pair it with a 24-month postpaid plan. While this may look attractive now, you may be paying more for a locked Tecno Pova 5 in the long run.

There are safe and very legal ways to unlock your device. Just try one of the following.

**_Ask your Carrier to Unlock your Device_**

This is the best option when you want to safely unlock your device. By February 2015, American cell phone owners got the option to request their carriers to unlock their device for them. Before that the law didn't allow for carriers to unlock SIM cards in the United States. This unpopular law was reversed following a similar move by the European Union in 2013. The same law also requires that the carriers inform customers every month whether their device is eligible for unlocking.

If your device is eligible for unlocking, all you need to do is contact the carrier provide and request for the [sim network unlock pin](https://drfone.wondershare.com/unlock/unlock-samsung-sim-network-unlock-pin.html). But if your Smartphone was bought on a contract, you may need to pay a termination fee to break the contract of you want to unlock the Tecno Pova 5 device before the contact term expires. For Smartphones that are not on contract, you have to wait 12 months from the date of purchase and ensure that your bill is paid before the carrier can give you the unlock code.

**_How to Unlock your Android Phone_**

To begin with, you need to confirm your IMEI number. Dial \*#06# on your device and the IMEI number will appear on the screen. Copy this number to a secure location or wrote it down somewhere.

![android SIM unlock-safeunlockcode](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2016/06/14670084936436.jpg)

You will need to enter the IMEI number as part of the information you need to provide before they can unlock your device.

## Part 3: Troubleshooting Android SIM Unlock

There are lots of issues you may face when you try to unlock your device. The following are just some of the troubleshooting actions you can take if you encounter these problems.

**_Unlocking Code Fails to work_**

If you asked your carrier to unlock your device for you, chances are that they sent you a code. If the unlocking code fails to work double check that the IMEI number you used is the correct one and ensure that you purchased that device from that carrier and then try again.

**_Samsung Device Freezes during unlocking_**

If your device freezes during the unlocking process it typically means that you entered wrong unlocking code too many times. In this case you need to contact the carrier for a Master Code.

**_My LG device won't unlock_**

There are some LG models that cannot be unlocked. These models include LG U300, LG U310, LG U8180, LG U8330, LG U8120, LG U8360, LG U8380, LGU880, and LG U890. If your device is one of these it can't be unlocked by your carrier. You may need to look into other ways of unlocking your device.
