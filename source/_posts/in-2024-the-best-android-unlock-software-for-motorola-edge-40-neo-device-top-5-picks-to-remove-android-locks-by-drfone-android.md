As indicated in the introduction, unlocked phone users can freely choose the plans they subscribed to---on any carriers, in any country. Therefore, if you travel frequently around the world, having an unlocked Motorola Edge 40 Neo would be beneficial. Using a local SIM card is much cheaper than paying for exorbitant roaming charges.

You can also benefit from an unlocked Motorola Edge 40 Neo if you are the kind of person who likes to take advantage of current offers provided by your local carriers. Prepaid plans are always changing in terms of offering so having the flexibility of changing carriers and prepaid plans can help you save money in the long run.

## Part 6: The downside of an unlocked Motorola Edge 40 Neo

Are you thinking "Well, why can't I just buy an unlocked Motorola Edge 40 Neo in the first place?" right about now? Well, you can but think of the amount of money it will cost you.

For example, in Australia, an unlocked Motorola Edge 40 Neo will cost around $499 from any Motorola outlet but $0 for the Motorola Edge 40 Neo device when you pair it with a 24-month postpaid plan.
