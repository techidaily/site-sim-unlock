## Part 2: How to SIM Unlock your Android Device

If you find that your SIM is locked, here's a few things you can do to unlock the Poco X6 device.

There are safe and very legal ways to unlock your device. Just try one of the following.

**_Ask your Carrier to Unlock your Device_**

This is the best option when you want to safely unlock your device. By February 2015, American cell phone owners got the option to request their carriers to unlock their device for them. Before that the law didn't allow for carriers to unlock SIM cards in the United States. This unpopular law was reversed following a similar move by the European Union in 2013. The same law also requires that the carriers inform customers every month whether their device is eligible for unlocking.

If your device is eligible for unlocking, all you need to do is contact the carrier provide and request for the [sim network unlock pin](https://drfone.wondershare.com/unlock/unlock-samsung-sim-network-unlock-pin.html). But if your Smartphone was bought on a contract, you may need to pay a termination fee to break the contract of you want to unlock the Poco X6 device before the contact term expires. For Smartphones that are not on contract, you have to wait 12 months from the date of purchase and ensure that your bill is paid before the carrier can give you the unlock code.

**_How to Unlock your Android Phone_**

To begin with, you need to confirm your IMEI number. Dial \*#06# on your device and the IMEI number will appear on the screen. Copy this number to a secure location or wrote it down somewhere.

You will need to enter the IMEI number as part of the information you need to provide before they can unlock your device.

## Part 3: Troubleshooting Android SIM Unlock

There are lots of issues you may face when you try to unlock your device. The following are just some of the troubleshooting actions you can take if you encounter these problems.

**_Unlocking Code Fails to work_**

If you asked your carrier to unlock your device for you, chances are that they sent you a code. If the unlocking code fails to work double check that the IMEI number you used is the correct one and ensure that you purchased that device from that carrier and then try again.

**_Samsung Device Freezes during unlocking_**

If your device freezes during the unlocking process it typically means that you entered wrong unlocking code too many times. In this case you need to contact the carrier for a Master Code.

**_My LG device won't unlock_**

There are some LG models that cannot be unlocked. These models include LG U300, LG U310, LG U8180, LG U8330, LG U8120, LG U8360, LG U8380, LGU880, and LG U890. If your device is one of these it can't be unlocked by your carrier. You may need to look into other ways of unlocking your device.

## Unlocking Your Android Phone: Everything You Need to Know to Use Any SIM Card

Getting carrier locked on the phone is one of the worst things that can happen especially when you feel there is not much you can do about it. But that’s not really true. There are few ways that could help alleviate this problem or which could come as a help in such circumstances when the Smartphone is carrier locked. This problem often requires help from the carrier or network and can be easily sorted on doing so.

Now, having talked about SIM lock or carrier lock, it is also important to know whether a device is SIM locked or not, because not all phones are SIM locked. So, to find out whether your phone is network locked, you can check the documentation of the Poco X6 device that you received while purchasing. If the phone is unlocked, the “unlocked word would certainly appear on the receipt. To be sure and precise whether the phone is SIM locked, the best thing that can be done is to contact the carrier and check if the phone is carrier locked. Before that, you can even check the phone yourself by placing a different SIM in the phone and check whether it works. If the same issue persists even with different SIMs, then there is a good chance that the phone is carrier locked. Now that we know how to check if the phone is SIM locked, it is imperative to know how to unlock Android phone for different carrier. It is not that difficult a task to unlock carrier locked phones and there are a few methods to unlock such locked phones.

## Part 1: Asking the Carrier to Unlock

One of the best options is getting in touch with the carrier and asking them to unlock the SIM locked phone. For that to happen, it is important to first know whether the phone is SIM locked and then whether the phone can be unlocked and if you are eligible to unlock the phone. There is an eligibility clause in contract for Smartphones bought on contract and if a specific time period is not up yet, then a termination fee is required to be paid by the user to break the contract in order to be able to use any SIM on the Poco X6 device after getting the unlock code.

**_Pros_**

• This is the best way to unlock carrier locked devices.

• This is legal and everything happens based on the clause mentioned in the contract.

**_Cons  
_**

• Sometimes, even the network providers or carrier refuse to unlock Smartphone

• There is a certain time period which if not over yet, unlocking the phone would require termination fee.

## Part 2: Professional Reputable Smartphone Unlock Service

If you have tried out contacting the carrier and there is no way the carrier is unlocking your phone, you can opt for professional unlock service which could be of help. But finding such a professional service is not an easy task. There are some sites and service providers which require the IMEI number of the phone to create unlock codes. IMEI number of the phone is given to the professional SIM unlock service post which, they generate a special character combination which can be used to get the cell phone out of network restrictions. So, the phone can be unlocked remotely by using the special remote unlock codes.

Sometimes, the professional Smartphone service providers even ask for the phone to be sent to them to get the phone unlocked.

**_Pros_**

• This method could be opted as a last resort if there is no help from the carrier.

• Professional and reputable Smartphone unlock service providers tend to serve the purpose as they are specialized in this task.

• There are not many obligations involved.

**_Cons  
_**

• This might attract legal actions against the user.

• It is very difficult to find such professional Smartphone unlock service providers.

• Reliability on such service providers is also another factor which requires attention.
