With that your Apple iPhone SE (2022) is now completely unlock activated! You're free to use it as you please now.

In this article we've explained how to unlock T Mobile Apple iPhone SE (2022) using DoctorSIM - SIM Unlock Service, and how to unlock T Mobile iPhone 5s using the T Mobile carrier itself. While both of them are perfectly legitimate means of unlocking your Apple iPhone SE (2022)s, I personally lean more towards the DoctorSIM solution as they don't have any pesky eligibility criteria, nor do they make you wait long. They are a 100% solution, especially considering they're a third-party tool which makes them less biased as they don't have an incentive to keep you from unlocking.
