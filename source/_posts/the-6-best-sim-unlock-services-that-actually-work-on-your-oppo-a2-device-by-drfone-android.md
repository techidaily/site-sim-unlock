### 2\. Unlock Base

Website URL: [https://www.unlockbase.com/wholesale-phone-unlocking](https://www.unlockbase.com/wholesale-phone-unlocking)

This service will unlock almost all devices, both Android and iPhone. It is also very fast and reliable. But perhaps the best feature of this service is that you can be aware of just how much you will have to spend to unlock your device long before you place the order.

To use the service, simply go to the main home page and check on the table provided how long it will take for your device to be unlocked and how much you have to pay. If you are happy with both estimates. Choose to unlock from the main menu and then proceed to select your device.

Once you have selected the Oppo A2 device, enter the IMEI code, your email address, your country, and the network you are on. Then click on "Proceed to check out". Make payment and then wait for the assigned time for the [sim network unlock pin](https://drfone.wondershare.com/unlock/unlock-samsung-sim-network-unlock-pin.html) to be sent to the email address you provided.

### 3\. iPhone IMEI

Website URL: [https://iphoneimei.net/](https://appleiphoneunlock.uk/network/Special%20Services/Activation%20Lock?aff=wondershare)

continue.  You will be sent to a checkout page where you can pay the amount. The codes will be sent to the email address you provided at checkout.

Step 1. Visit Doctor - SIM Unlock Service official website, click on the Select Your Oppo A2 button, and then select Oppo among all the phone brands.

## Part 3: Oppo A2 Unlock Carrier

If your Oppo A2 is hard locked, this is your best bet in getting your device unlocked. Actually, it is the safest method among all three:

1. Get a new SIM card from a new carrier.
2. Call your carrier's customer service line and ask what are the requirements to qualify you to get your Oppo A2 unlocked. If you have honored your contract, there should not be any problems. However, do ask your carrier if there are any additional requirements. Do note that there may be fees involved.
3. Once your customer service representative has determined if you have met all their requirements, they should give you the SIM network unlock PIN Oppo A2. Again, depending on your carrier, they might either give you the code over the phone, through email or via SMS. If you have the choice, always opt for email or SMS so that you are able to jot down the right number.
4. Once you have gotten the code, insert the new SIM card (from your new carrier). You will receive a prompt to enter your code. Make sure that you key in the right code---entering the wrong code will cause your phone to be locked (possibly forever).

## Part 4: Oppo A2 Unlock App/Software

There are some of us out there who are just not confident with doing things ourselves or trusting our own carrier.

HOWEVER, if your first instinct is to head to Google Play to look for SIM unlock tools, heed these cautions. There are currently many apps that claim that they can unlock your phone but it is just a scam. You should also avoid torrent files available online. These apps and software are usually laced with Trojans and other types of malware. So do sort through the reviews so that you will not fall into a malicious trap.

One that we can attest to is  **[MyMobileUnlocking.com](http://mymobileunlocking.com/)**; it is fast and affordable. Here is how you can unlock your Oppo A2:

- Choose your Country from the dropdown menu and click the  **Confirm country** button.

## Part 5: The benefits of an unlocked Oppo A2

If you now know how to unlock Oppo A2 but still do not know its advantages, we are here to help.

As indicated in the introduction, unlocked phone users can freely choose the plans they subscribed to---on any carriers, in any country. Therefore, if you travel frequently around the world, having an unlocked Oppo A2 would be beneficial. Using a local SIM card is much cheaper than paying for exorbitant roaming charges.

You can also benefit from an unlocked Oppo A2 if you are the kind of person who likes to take advantage of current offers provided by your local carriers. Prepaid plans are always changing in terms of offering so having the flexibility of changing carriers and prepaid plans can help you save money in the long run.

## Part 6: The downside of an unlocked Oppo A2

Are you thinking "Well, why can't I just buy an unlocked Oppo A2 in the first place?" right about now? Well, you can but think of the amount of money it will cost you.

For example, in Australia, an unlocked Oppo A2 will cost around $499 from any Oppo outlet but $0 for the Oppo A2 device when you pair it with a 24-month postpaid plan. While this may look attractive now, you may be paying more for a locked Oppo A2 in the long run.

## Conclusion

Now that you know the three ways of unlocking your Oppo A2, all you need to do is find one that is most compatible with you. Just remember to think of everything through and carefully. Most importantly, if you have a locked device, always seek advice from your carrier to see if this is possible.

## Part 2: Unlockitfree.com for free Oppo unlock codes

Unlockitfree.com is a free remote unlock service, providing unlocking codes for Oppo A2 phones and other models. They offer a fast and free service, but it is not always reliable.

### How to use the Unlockitfree.com Unlock Service?

1\. First, enter your phone’s unique IMEI into the site, and then the site checks to ensure that it is genuine.

2\. Choose your phone model from the list provided, and then choose your country. Once you choose your country, a list of supported Service Providers will pop up. Choose your service provider, read the terms and conditions and accept. At this point, click Generate.

3\. The Unlockitfree Generator will show you a series of 7 different unlocking codes. Not all of these will work; usually the best options are the 1st and 7th code on the list.

4\. Without removing your SIM card, input these codes into your phone’s Home screen.

Hopefully you will have success – although, this is not guaranteed (as it is with the first Dr.Fone option above).

## Part 3: FreeUnlocks for free unlock codes for Oppo

[Unlock-Free](https://www.freeunlocks.com/) is a great option for unlocking your locked Oppo A2 phone. The steps are quite simple and hassle free, but do keep in mind that this is a paid service. You might be able to use a free offer from TrialPay in order to get your Oppo A2 phone unlocked for free.
