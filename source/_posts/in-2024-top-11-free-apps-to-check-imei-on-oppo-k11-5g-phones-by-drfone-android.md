1. Get a new SIM card from a new carrier.
2. Call your carrier's customer service line and ask what are the requirements to qualify you to get your Oppo K11 5G unlocked. If you have honored your contract, there should not be any problems.

3. Once your customer service representative has determined if you have met all their requirements, they should give you the SIM network unlock PIN Oppo K11 5G. Again, depending on your carrier, they might either give you the code over the phone, through email or via SMS.
