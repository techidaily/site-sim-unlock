Many people find it difficult to unlock their MetroPCS iPhone and resort to buying a new phone altogether to use it with another service provider. In this article, you will learn how to use the MetroPCS unlock phones feature with three different methods. So, letâs get started!

### 1\. Calling MetroPCS to Unlock Phones

The first and most straightforward method to carrier unlocks MetroPCS phone is to call the company. But before you do that, make sure whether your phone has GSM/LTE or CDMA technology. Check for the small slot on the side of your phone to see whether thereâs a SIM.

If your phone does not have a SIM, it uses CDMA technology. You will have to call your new carrier company and request them to unlock your phone in such a case. However, if you find a SIM card, your phone works on GSM or LTE and can easily be unlocked by contacting MetroPCS customer care.

Hereâs how to do that:

The downside of this method is again the time consumption. You have to call and wait for your turn, answer a bunch of questions, and wait for several days before receiving a confirmation email. If you want to save all this time, you can unlock iPhone MetroPCS for free using a more time-efficient method, i.e., using an unlock tool like [Dr.Fone â Sim Unlock](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/iphone-unlock/).

### Q. What do I do if I unlock My Apple iPhone 13 and now my SIM card doesn't work?

If you get this error, it means that the SIM card you have inserted into the Apple iPhone 13 device is not supported by the activation policy assigned by the activation server. To solve this issue, you need a SIM from a supported carrier and request them to unlock the iPhone.

## Part 1: What Should You Do Before Apple iPhone 13 SIM Unlock?

Before unlocking your Apple iPhone 13 from the carrier, you should fulfill the following criteria.

### 1\. No Due Before Unlocking

When iPhone users sign contracts with a giant cell phone company for a certain amount of time, they often get a discount on a device. Because of this, the Apple iPhone 13 device comes with a controller lock so customers can only use it on their network.

So, if you've paid off your contract or bought your Apple iPhone 13 without a subsidy, it's perfectly legal to unlock it. But if you're still paying off your contract, you still need to own the Apple iPhone 13 fully, so you should confirm with your carrier before unlocking it.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### 2\. You Should Buy It for More Than the Time Limit in the Contract

You can leave without paying anything if your agreement with the company is over. If you signed a contract in exchange for a lower price upfront, you would have to wait until your contract ended (usually 24 months) or pay the remaining balance if you bought your phone on a payment plan.

### Examples: Requirements of Sim Unlock of T-Mobile/EE/AT&T

T-Mobile, EE, and AT&T have common requirements before you can unlock your Apple iPhone 13.

- It has to be legal. It means the Apple iPhone 13 device has not been reported as lost, stolen, or linked to a crime.
- Your bank account shouldn't have any debts.
- If you signed a contract in exchange for a lower price upfront, you would have to wait until your contract was up (usually 24 months) or pay the remaining balance if you bought your phone on a payment plan.

Apart from the requirements mentioned above, each company has its way of unlocking.

**T-Mobile**

- When you call about tips, make sure you have ALL of the following:

1. The main account holder's phone number

![ee](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/12/unlock-iphone-x-3.jpg)

Following are the unlocking requirements of EE.

- EE will only unlock pay-per-month phones after six months.

- EE will unlock the Apple iPhone 13 immediately; there is no waiting period. If you didn't buy the phone from EE, you'd have to pay Â£8.99. If that's the case, there's no fee.
