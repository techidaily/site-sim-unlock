## How to Unlock SIM Card on Tecno Spark 10 4G online without jailbreak

Isn't it so frustrating when you try to change your SIM or your network, but just can't because your phone is locked under contract? Phones are our life source in this global age, it's our tether to reality, to the world! But if you have a carrier locked phone, then that connection is basically under contract by an external agency! You can't change your networks, there are limitations on how you use your phone, and when you have to travel abroad you have no option other than paying the roaming charges. If you, say, have an iPhone 5c and have these frustrations, it's likely you're already wondering how to unlock the iPhone 5c.

Chances are that if you've had a carrier locked phone for a while, you might have already forgotten what cellular freedom feels like. But we're here to remind you. All you have to do is break that carrier-lock, and you're good to go. However, you should be careful when doing so, cause if you try using a jailbreaking technique, it could have major repercussions. So we're here to give you some valuable advice about how to unlock iPhone 5, iPhone 5c, or even Android phones.

## Part 1: Unlock SIM Card on Tecno Spark 10 4G via jailbreak

Before we get into telling you how to unlock iPhone 5, or the SIM Card on iPhone or Android, we should first tell you what Jailbreaking is. You might have heard of this term before, and I'm sure it sounded ominous to you. Jailbreak? It sounds awfully close to 'Prison break.' Well, considering the carrier lock is sort of like a prison for your cell, it is an accurate terminology. But Jailbreak isn't just about breaking the carrier lock. That might happen as a by-product, but the real purpose is to break free of the software restrictions which are generally applied to Apple devices. This might seem like a good option because, well, who doesn't want to break free of all of Apple's restrictions? But that always comes at several heavy risks.

### Threats of unlocking SIM via Jailbreak

#### 1\. Not Permanent

This has got to be one of the biggest reasons for not jailbreaking your phone. It is not at all permanent! In fact, the moment you update your system, your jailbreak is lost and if you've started using a different SIM it will no longer function, and you're gonna have to go back to using that Carrier you tried so hard to escape from! It's really not worth the effort. Of course, you could stop updating altogether, but then that will bring us to…

![Unlock SIM Card on iPhone and Android via jailbreak](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2016/10/14771444107532.jpg)

#### 2\. Risky

If you don't update your iOS, or Mac or iPad or any device at all, in this day and age, you're basically just asking to be hacked. That is not to excuse those who do the hacking and plant malware on your system, but if you leave your front door open in a shitty neighborhood, well then you only have yourself to blame once you get robbed!

#### 3\. Warranty

Jailbreaking has now become kind-of-legal, in a very tenuous sense, but that doesn't mean Apple wholeheartedly welcomes jailbreaking. If you do so, you will never again be able to avail of the warranty on your phone. And with the kind of major bucks you have to shell out for those iPhones, you best keep that warranty intact.

#### 4\. Lack of Apps

Many top-notch and crucial app companies and organizations simply refuse to make their applications usable in jailbreak phones, as they are extremely risky and prone to hacking. As a result, you would have to rely on a bunch of non-professional apps made by amateurs, which is more likely to put your phone in harm's way.

#### 5\. Bricking

This basically means your whole system may crash and stop functioning. As a result, you're gonna' have to restore the whole thing and try to salvage whatever information you can. Now those who do jailbreak regularly will give you all kinds of excuses like it happens only rarely or that you can retrieve your data simply from the cloud, et al. But do you really want to divest all your time and energy trying to fight off malware, backing up all your data, etc, especially when there is a much more convenient option just around the corner?

Didn't think so.

## Part 2: How to SIM Unlock your Android Device

If you find that your SIM is locked, here's a few things you can do to unlock the Tecno Spark 10 4G device.

Avoid all of the apps on the Google Play Store that promise to unlock your device, most of them don't work and may even harbour a lot of Trojans and malware that will cause further problems for you and your device.

There are safe and very legal ways to unlock your device. Just try one of the following.

**_Ask your Carrier to Unlock your Device_**

This is the best option when you want to safely unlock your device. By February 2015, American cell phone owners got the option to request their carriers to unlock their device for them. Before that the law didn't allow for carriers to unlock SIM cards in the United States. This unpopular law was reversed following a similar move by the European Union in 2013. The same law also requires that the carriers inform customers every month whether their device is eligible for unlocking.

If your device is eligible for unlocking, all you need to do is contact the carrier provide and request for the [sim network unlock pin](https://drfone.wondershare.com/unlock/unlock-samsung-sim-network-unlock-pin.html). But if your Smartphone was bought on a contract, you may need to pay a termination fee to break the contract of you want to unlock the Tecno Spark 10 4G device before the contact term expires. For Smartphones that are not on contract, you have to wait 12 months from the date of purchase and ensure that your bill is paid before the carrier can give you the unlock code.

**_How to Unlock your Android Phone_**

To begin with, you need to confirm your IMEI number. Dial \*#06# on your device and the IMEI number will appear on the screen. Copy this number to a secure location or wrote it down somewhere.

The next step is to find a reputable service that will unlock your Android device for you. This is action you should take only if you are absolutely desperate and your carrier can't unlock your device for you. This is because many of these sites are unregulated and many of them are not reliable.

You should also know that many of them will charge a certain amount for your service. You can try <https://www.safeunlockcode.com/> which is one of the more reputable ones we have found.

You will need to enter the IMEI number as part of the information you need to provide before they can unlock your device.

## Part 3: Troubleshooting Android SIM Unlock

There are lots of issues you may face when you try to unlock your device. The following are just some of the troubleshooting actions you can take if you encounter these problems.

**_Unlocking Code Fails to work_**

If you asked your carrier to unlock your device for you, chances are that they sent you a code. If the unlocking code fails to work double check that the IMEI number you used is the correct one and ensure that you purchased that device from that carrier and then try again.

**_Samsung Device Freezes during unlocking_**

If your device freezes during the unlocking process it typically means that you entered wrong unlocking code too many times. In this case you need to contact the carrier for a Master Code.

**_My LG device won't unlock_**

There are some LG models that cannot be unlocked. These models include LG U300, LG U310, LG U8180, LG U8330, LG U8120, LG U8360, LG U8380, LGU880, and LG U890. If your device is one of these it can't be unlocked by your carrier. You may need to look into other ways of unlocking your device.
