If you are currently not a Boost customer and have been a customer earlier or have never been a customer and have purchased from a previous owner, you can still get your phone unlocked, though the process becomes a little complicated and the following are the requirements.

- You would need a Boost mobile number or an account number that was last associated with the Apple iPhone 12 mini device.

Different Ways To Unlock Cricket iPhone

Here’s an overview of the options available:

Cricket Network Unlock Code Free From Cricket Wireless

It is the most straightforward approach, but it comes with some restrictions. You must meet Cricket’s unlock policy requirements. If you fulfill these conditions, you can request a **Cricket unlock code for free** online.

Early Unlocking for Military Personnel

Good news if you’re in the military. You can ask their customer support to unlock your Apple iPhone 12 mini, even if you haven’t used the service for six months. Having a **Cricket device unlocked** earlier is a way to help you stay connected during deployments.

Third-Party iPhone Unlocking Tools

Not all devices can be unlocked by Cricket if you don’t qualify for their requirements. However, paid online services and third-party apps can open up your options. These tools can help you use your phone on any compatible carrier, even if you don’t meet **Cricket device unlock** requirements.

While this option can be faster, choosing a reputable service provider and understanding the associated risks is crucial. Ensure it is legal in your region and won’t harm your phone’s functionality.
