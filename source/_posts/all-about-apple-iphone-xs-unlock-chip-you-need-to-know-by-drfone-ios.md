The most common barrier is that you can't use a SIM card from another network. The good news is that you can set up your Apple iPhone XS to connect to any network you want in several ways.

When you buy an iPhone, it is either locked (unable to accept carrier) or factory unlocked (can accept any carrier). These unlock chips can bypass the carrier locks in iPhones and enable locked devices to work with any SIM.

An unlock chip is an easy and cheap way to get an Apple iPhone XS to work with a different SIM card Using iPhone unlock chip enables the locked Apple iPhone XS to call and send SMS using the local network sim card, just like a factory-unlocked phone does. There have been different unlocking chips available with different names and brands, but they all do the same thing.

### How does it work

An unlock chip is typically a slim SIM card, a memory interface chip that can be put in along with your regular SIM card. It goes on top of your Apple iPhone XS's normal SIM card and removes the network lock so you can use any sim.

![iphone unlock chip](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/12/iphone-unlock-chip-4.jpg)

The factory lock is removed quickly when an unlock chip is put into your Apple iPhone XS. An iPhone Unlock Chip fools your Apple iPhone XS into thinking it only uses a Cricket SIM card. The Apple iPhone XS Unlock Chip has the structure to fake the iPhone's IMEI number and the authentication key, which allows it to work with any GSM Service.

Putting an iPhone Unlock Chip around your regular SIM card changes how your Apple iPhone XS and SIM card talk to each other. So, the unlock chip's controller fakes the IMSI number, which allows you to use other mobile networks.

Unfortunately, many iPhone unlock chips require a jailbroken iPhone before being used. Even if your Apple iPhone XS isn't jailbroken, you can still use an iPhone unlock chip to access some of its features.

There are several places to find information about jailbreaking an iPhone. After selecting, you can program your Apple iPhone XS's unlock chip by following the on-screen instructions.

Navigate to Settings > General > About.

Scroll down to find the section called "Network Provider Lock." If the Apple iPhone XS is unlocked, it should say "No SIM restrictions" on the screen. If you see something different, it means the Apple iPhone XS is locked.
