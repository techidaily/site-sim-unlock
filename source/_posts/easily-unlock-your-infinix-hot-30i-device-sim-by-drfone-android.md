## Part 1: What Does It Mean If Your Infinix Hot 30i Asks for SIM Network PIN?

When your phone prompts you to enter a SIM Network Unlock PIN, it means that your device is currently locked to a specific mobile network carrier, and it can only be used with SIM cards from that carrier. This locking mechanism is usually put in place by the carrier or the phone manufacturer to ensure that you continue to use their services, typically for the duration of a contract. As a result, your phone cannot be freely used with SIM cards from other carriers until it's unlocked using the correct PIN or code.

## Part 2: Why Does Your Infinix Hot 30i Say Invalid SIM Card – Network Locked SIM Card Inserted?

![remove network lock](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/11/fix-network-locked-simcard-inserted-2.jpg)

**System Errors**

Since SIM locking is a smartphone restriction implemented to stop it from being used on other networks, Android system errors can cause network-locked SIM cards. Resetting these errors can help unlock your **network locked SIM card inserted** device. Service providers decided to provide a formal SIM unlocking option as a result.

Because of this, any locked SIM may be readily unlocked, and once a device opens, it can work like a conventional mobile phone and with any SIM card of the user's choosing.

**Carrier Lock**

The consumer must stick with the same service provider for a specific time after purchasing the bundled device and data pack. This is called a carrier lock on the Infinix Hot 30i device and is one of the most common errors in **network locked SIM card inserted** devices. During that time, the Infinix Hot 30i device will be network- or SIM-locked, prohibiting the user from changing service providers.

The user cannot change the SIM. The service provider will offer the SIM Unlock code needed to unlock the handset when the contract expires. The gadget can be used with any other SIM card and exported to another country without problems when the network lock has been removed.

**Region Lock**

Apple and AT&T initially worked together to implement the SIM lock and the SIM locked devices. The original purpose was to force the user to continue using the same service provider in a specific area or time.

However, some telecom service providers sell the handsets with select data plans as bundled plans in collaboration with the Infinix Hot 30i device manufacturers. As a result, the handset will cost less than it would otherwise. Sometimes, these offers are particular to a specific region, called a carrier lock.

**Firmware Problems**

Sometimes, the Infinix Hot 30i device manufacturers release many versions of the same firmware for different geographical locations.

As a result, it may be possible that the user may face contradictions in the agreement of device firmware and the network-locked SIM card that was supposed to be used on the Infinix Hot 30i device. Due to firmware problems, the users may also face a network-locked SIM card-inserted device.

## Part 3: How to Unlock Network Locked SIM Card Inserted?

Unlocking a network-locked SIM card may seem like a complex task. However, it can be a straightforward process if you follow the right steps. In this section, we will guide you through the process of unlocking your network-locked SIM card. We will discuss 3 different ways you can unlock a **network-locked SIM card inserted**:

### Method 1. Contact Network Carrier to Unlock Network Locked SIM

Contacting your network carrier is often the most recommended choice. It is a straightforward and reliable method to unlock your network-locked SIM card. Unlocking your network-locked SIM card through your carrier is a reliable and legal method. Before contacting your carrier, get information like your device's IMEI number and account details. There are several ways to get in touch with your network carrier's customer support.

You can call the customer support hotline, visit the website, or go to a physical store. The process usually involves receiving an unlock network code, which you need to use. Once you've entered the unlock code, your phone should display that it's now unlocked. Test it with the new SIM card to ensure that it can make calls, send texts, and access mobile data without any issues.

## Part 4: Why is SIM Unlocking Important?

As previously stated, a SIM lock enables a service provider to stop a customer from using the smartphone with the SIM cards of another service provider. This guarantees that the Infinix Hot 30i device is only being used with the original SIM card for each provider. This locking also has a lot of drawbacks because it is incompatible with any other SIM card.

1. The phone cannot be used with other SIM cards if the SIM lock is enabled. Customers must therefore adhere to the current plan as is.
2. Since nobody wants to purchase a locked phone, it is hard for someone to sell or gift the mobile.
3. Traveling abroad with a SIM-locked phone could provide some challenges because you won't be able to use a local SIM card on the phone while you're there.

All the problems can be fixed, and the SIM works in any nation with the removed SIM lock.

### Conclusion

Any of the methods above can work to get around the prohibition against using other SIM cards with your Android handset. The best thing about using Dr.Fone-Screen Unlock is that you don't need unlocking codes to complete the tasks.

[![Selena Lee](https://drfone.wondershare.com/images/selena-lee.png)](https://drfone.wondershare.com/author/selena-lee/)

It is really irritating when you realize that Infinix Hot 30i phone is locked to a specific network. When you travel to another country, your phone becomes useless – you can’t use a foreign sim card. If your Infinix Hot 30i phone is locked to a network and want to switch to a different provider, you are out of luck.

Thankfully, there are a few easy ways to unlock your Infinix Hot 30i phone with free Infinix unlock codes. In this article, we review and explain 4 different websites that offer free unlock codes for Infinix Hot 30i phones. Read ahead and learn how you can use four Infinix unlock code websites.

## Part 1: SIM Unlock Service

SIM Unlock Service is one of the best and trust-worthy SIM unlock code generators available on the market. This is not a free option, but it is so effective that many users find it is worth the price. It saves you so much hassle that it is worth the small upfront fee. Doctorsim will permanently unlock your phone, enabling you to use your phone on all carriers around the world. Most importantly, using DoctorSim will not void your warranty.

### How to use DoctorSim SIM Unlock Service to unlock Infinix Hot 30i phones?

Step 1. Go to [DoctorSim's official website](https://www.doctorsim.com/libtrkafl.html?pc=43d47c30d945bcbd7d9527f4049f649a&refe=https://www.doctorsim.com/us-en/?scp&euro), so you know that you can trust it. Click on the ‘Select Your Infinix Hot 30i’ button, and then select Infinix from the list of brands.

Step 2. Fill in your phone’s information and your contact details in the following window, including the phone IMEI, phone model, and your email. Once your order is processed, the system will send you your personalized unlock code and unlocking instructions. You can then follow the instructions to unlock your Infinix Hot 30i phone. Easy!

## Part 2: Unlockitfree.com for free Infinix unlock codes

Unlockitfree.com is a free remote unlock service, providing unlocking codes for Infinix Hot 30i phones and other models. They offer a fast and free service, but it is not always reliable.

### How to use the Unlockitfree.com Unlock Service?

1\. First, enter your phone’s unique IMEI into the site, and then the site checks to ensure that it is genuine.

2\. Choose your phone model from the list provided, and then choose your country. Once you choose your country, a list of supported Service Providers will pop up. Choose your service provider, read the terms and conditions and accept. At this point, click Generate.

3\. The Unlockitfree Generator will show you a series of 7 different unlocking codes. Not all of these will work; usually the best options are the 1st and 7th code on the list.

4\. Without removing your SIM card, input these codes into your phone’s Home screen.

Hopefully you will have success – although, this is not guaranteed (as it is with the first Dr.Fone option above).
