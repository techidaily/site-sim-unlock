On [iPhoneIMEI.net](https://appleiphoneunlock.uk/network/Special%20Services/Activation%20Lock?aff=wondershare) official website, just select your Apple iPhone 13 Pro Max model and the network carrier your iphone is locked to, it will direct you to another page.

If you already know that your carrier is AT&T, you can contact them directly and get your Apple iPhone 13 Pro Max unlocked as follows:

#### **Step 1:** Go to their Site and Contact them

1\. Go to [https://www.att.com/deviceunlock/?#/](https://www.att.com/deviceunlock/?#/) first. This is the official location whereby you can contact them.

2\. The page will list out certain eligibility requirements. You have to read and agree to them before clicking 'Continue.'

![unlock att iphone via att carrier](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2016/10/14769325349486.jpg)

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### Requirements

However, AT&T has the right to dismiss anyone's request based on several requirements and criteria, so your application may yet be either rejected or you may have to go through further steps. It is a good idea to go through their requirements before you fill their form.

1\. The obvious requirement is that your Apple iPhone 13 Pro Max must be locked to AT&T, else you should go to the relevant carrier page.

2\. You iPhone couldn't have been reported as either lost or stolen.

3\. No record of it having been linked to any criminal or fraudulent activities.

4\. All termination fees have been paid in full, and all the other iPhone installment plans, etc, have been completed.

5\. After upgrading iPhone you must wait 14 days before you're eligible for unlock.

Finding out how to unlock AT&T iPhone can be harrowing if you don't know where to look, especially because performing the unlock can be so crucial for many people in order to access other carriers.

Both the options mentioned above offer a legitimate means by which you can AT&T unlock your Apple iPhone 13 Pro Max, whether done without a SIM card or by contacting the AT&T carrier.

However, going by personal experience the DoctorSIM alternative offers a much smoother, efficient and quicker alternative to contacting the AT&T carriers. It is also more secure because if you are going via the carrier without a SIM card then you'll need to back up your Apple iPhone 13 Pro Max, then delete and restore it as well (for security measures). This isn't just a time consuming process, but it can also prove to be risky. Furthermore, AT&T has a lot of checks and requisites in place which can keep your Apple iPhone 13 Pro Max from being unlocked, and even if you do pass the requisites it's still a time-consuming process which may still be rejected as AT&T has final say. As such, going via DoctorSIM gives you complete agency and conveniently AT&T unlocks iPhone without any data loss, through a simple 3 step process.

## How To Unlock Apple iPhone 13 Pro Max: Official Method to Unlock Your Apple iPhone 13 Pro Max

Restriction on the use of a SIM card by a carrier often creates a lot of problems. The barrier that you can't use another company's SIM somehow makes you feel like you're not the only owner of the phone. But you don't need to worry anymore because you are in the right place to know about the way use to unlock your Apple iPhone 13 Pro Max.

This article is about the official way to get your Apple iPhone 13 Pro Max unlocked from your carrier. But we also have a solution if you want to avoid contacting your carrier.

## Part 1: What Should You Do Before Apple iPhone 13 Pro Max SIM Unlock?

Before unlocking your Apple iPhone 13 Pro Max from the carrier, you should fulfill the following criteria.

### 1\. No Due Before Unlocking

When iPhone users sign contracts with a giant cell phone company for a certain amount of time, they often get a discount on a device. Because of this, the Apple iPhone 13 Pro Max device comes with a controller lock so customers can only use it on their network.

So, if you've paid off your contract or bought your Apple iPhone 13 Pro Max without a subsidy, it's perfectly legal to unlock it. But if you're still paying off your contract, you still need to own the Apple iPhone 13 Pro Max fully, so you should confirm with your carrier before unlocking it.

### 2\. You Should Buy It for More Than the Time Limit in the Contract

You can leave without paying anything if your agreement with the company is over. If you signed a contract in exchange for a lower price upfront, you would have to wait until your contract ended (usually 24 months) or pay the remaining balance if you bought your phone on a payment plan.

### Examples: Requirements of Sim Unlock of T-Mobile/EE/AT&T

T-Mobile, EE, and AT&T have common requirements before you can unlock your Apple iPhone 13 Pro Max.

- It has to be legal. It means the Apple iPhone 13 Pro Max device has not been reported as lost, stolen, or linked to a crime.
- Your bank account shouldn't have any debts.
- If you signed a contract in exchange for a lower price upfront, you would have to wait until your contract was up (usually 24 months) or pay the remaining balance if you bought your phone on a payment plan.

Apart from the requirements mentioned above, each company has its way of unlocking.

- If you meet the above requirements, you can call customer service at 611 from the Apple iPhone 13 Pro Max device you want to unlock to unlock an iPhone 11 or 12 that is locked to a T-Mobile network.
- When you call about tips, make sure you have ALL of the following:

1. The main account holder's phone number
2. Account Password
3. Account holder's SSN's last four digits
4. IMEI number. You can find this by navigating Settings > General > About or dialing \*#06#.

**AT&T**

Here’s an overview of the options available:

Cricket Network Unlock Code Free From Cricket Wireless

It is the most straightforward approach, but it comes with some restrictions. You must meet Cricket’s unlock policy requirements. If you fulfill these conditions, you can request a **Cricket unlock code for free** online.

Early Unlocking for Military Personnel

Good news if you’re in the military. You can ask their customer support to unlock your Apple iPhone 13 Pro Max, even if you haven’t used the service for six months. Having a **Cricket device unlocked** earlier is a way to help you stay connected during deployments.

Third-Party iPhone Unlocking Tools

Not all devices can be unlocked by Cricket if you don’t qualify for their requirements. However, paid online services and third-party apps can open up your options. These tools can help you use your phone on any compatible carrier, even if you don’t meet **Cricket device unlock** requirements.

While this option can be faster, choosing a reputable service provider and understanding the associated risks is crucial. Ensure it is legal in your region and won’t harm your phone’s functionality.

Ready to **unlock Cricket iPhone**? But wait, are you sure you meet the eligibility criteria? Let’s find out in the next section.

## Part 2: What Are the Requirements To Unlock Cricket iPhone?

You might be here because you are considering using your Cricket iPhone on other carriers. Unlocking allows switching wireless networks or increasing resale value. But before that, you need to meet the following requirements to **unlock Cricket iPhones** using the official method:

Exceptions for Active Military Personnel

If you’re in the military and can’t meet the six-month service rule, you can ask for a quick **device unlock from Cricket**. But there are still other requirements to fulfill, and you must show Cricket proof of your deployment. This proof can be military orders, deployment papers, or a letter from your commanding officer.
