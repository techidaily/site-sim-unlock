As mentioned earlier, carriers often provide official routes to unlock their devices. While typically requiring compliance with specific criteria, this method ensures you stay within your carrier’s policies.

Most carriers offer two common methods for unlocking their phones:

Remember, each carrier has its policies and procedures regarding unlocking. Consult your carrier’s official website or contact customer support for specific instructions and eligibility requirements.
