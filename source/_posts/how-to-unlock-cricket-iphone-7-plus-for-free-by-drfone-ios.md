### Option 1: Freedom After Two Years

If you’ve been loyal to Telstra and maintained a phone plan for 24 months or more, congratulations! You’re entitled to **unlock your Telstra phone for free**. This allows you to explore other networks without any additional cost. Contact Telstra through their app or phone; their friendly representatives will guide you through the process.

### Option 2: Pay as You Go

Haven’t quite reached the two-year mark yet? Don’t worry! Telstra offers a paid unlocking option based on how long you’ve been with them:

- **Under 6 months:**$80 unlock fee
- **6 months to 2 years:**$25 unlock fee

Remember that these fees are subject to change, so it’s always best to double-check with Telstra’s website or customer service for the latest information.

### How To Request for Telstra Phone Unlock

To unlock your Telstra phone, follow the steps below using the said options. Both utilize Telstra’s official customer representative line, after all.

![my telstra app app store](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/02/how-to-unlock-telstra-02.jpg)

- **Step 1:** Find your IMEI number. This unique 17-digit code identifies your phone. Dial \*#06# on your Apple iPhone 7 Plus, or locate it on the back of the phone (if applicable) or the original box.
- **Step 2:** Use the My Telstra app under the “Get Help” section, call 125 8887 from a Telstra phone, 13 22 00 from a non-Telstra phone, or +61 439 125 888 if you’re overseas.
- **Step 3:** A Telstra representative will guide you through the process, explain any applicable fees, and assist you with payment if you are still within the 2-year period.

Before proceeding, it’s important to back up your phone data, as unlocking might erase it. Once complete, your Apple iPhone 7 Plus will be network-lock-free, ready to embrace the world beyond Telstra.

While this information is current, visiting Telstra’s website or contacting their customer service for the latest fee structure and any policy updates is advisable. Also, note that this method can **unlock Telstra phones** other than iPhones.

## Method 2: How To Unlock iPhones With a Third-Party Phone Tool \[Recommended\]

For those seeking a potentially faster route to **unlock Telstra iPhones** or those who wish to avoid opening fees, third-party phone unlocking tools like Wondershare Dr.Fone present an alternative option. However, it’s crucial to consider the potential trade-offs before venturing down this path.

**Disclaimer:** It’s vital to note that unlocking methods, particularly with third-party tools, may not always be successful, especially for newer iPhone models and iOS versions.

## Method 3: Using Online Unlockers To Unlock Telstra iPhones

While venturing into the online realm, you might encounter websites offering remote unlocking services for a fee. These services claim to **unlock your Telstra phone** quickly and conveniently, often without contacting the carrier. However, approaching this method requires extreme caution due to potential risks and legal implications.

Before diving in:

- **Understand the risks.**Online unlocking services operate in a gray area, potentially violating your carrier’s terms and conditions. This could lead to legal trouble or void your phone’s warranty.
- **Beware of scams.**Unfortunately, not all online unlocking services are legitimate. Many are scams designed to steal your money or personal information.
- **Do your research.**If you choose to proceed, thoroughly research the service provider. Read reviews from other users, check their track record, and ensure they have a good reputation.

These services typically require you to provide your phone’s IMEI number and pay a fee. They then claim to use various methods, often software or network vulnerabilities, to unlock your phone remotely. However, the success rate and security of these methods are highly questionable. Thus, relying on Dr.Fone as an alternative unlocking method is recommended.

## Conclusion

**Unlocking Telstra iPhones** gives you network flexibility, but navigating the process requires a measured approach. Remember, while Telstra’s official methods offer a guaranteed and secure path to freedom, third-party tools like Wondershare Dr.Fone present a potential avenue for those seeking alternative solutions.

After all, Wondershare Dr.Fone remains a valuable tool for your broader phone needs. From data recovery to system repair, its diverse functionalities can enhance your mobile experience in various ways. You can use it as an all-in-one application for all your needs, from network unlocking to system repair.
