## Method 1: How To Unlock Apple iPhone 11 With Telstra’s Official Methods

For peace of mind and guaranteed success, unlocking your Telstra iPhone through Telstra’s official methods is the ideal choice. This straightforward approach ensures a smooth transition and adheres to carrier policies, eliminating potential complications. There are two main options offered to **unlock Telstra phones.**

### Option 1: Freedom After Two Years

If you’ve been loyal to Telstra and maintained a phone plan for 24 months or more, congratulations! You’re entitled to **unlock your Telstra phone for free**. This allows you to explore other networks without any additional cost. Contact Telstra through their app or phone; their friendly representatives will guide you through the process.

### Option 2: Pay as You Go

Haven’t quite reached the two-year mark yet? Don’t worry! Telstra offers a paid unlocking option based on how long you’ve been with them:

- **Under 6 months:**$80 unlock fee
- **6 months to 2 years:**$25 unlock fee

Remember that these fees are subject to change, so it’s always best to double-check with Telstra’s website or customer service for the latest information.

### How To Request for Telstra Phone Unlock

To unlock your Telstra phone, follow the steps below using the said options. Both utilize Telstra’s official customer representative line, after all.

![my telstra app app store](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/02/how-to-unlock-telstra-02.jpg)

- **Step 1:** Find your IMEI number. This unique 17-digit code identifies your phone. Dial \*#06# on your Apple iPhone 11, or locate it on the back of the phone (if applicable) or the original box.
- **Step 2:** Use the My Telstra app under the “Get Help” section, call 125 8887 from a Telstra phone, 13 22 00 from a non-Telstra phone, or +61 439 125 888 if you’re overseas.
- **Step 3:** A Telstra representative will guide you through the process, explain any applicable fees, and assist you with payment if you are still within the 2-year period.

Before proceeding, it’s important to back up your phone data, as unlocking might erase it. Once complete, your Apple iPhone 11 will be network-lock-free, ready to embrace the world beyond Telstra.

**Disclaimer:** It’s vital to note that unlocking methods, particularly with third-party tools, may not always be successful, especially for newer iPhone models and iOS versions.

## Method 3: Using Online Unlockers To Unlock Telstra iPhones

While venturing into the online realm, you might encounter websites offering remote unlocking services for a fee. These services claim to **unlock your Telstra phone** quickly and conveniently, often without contacting the carrier. However, approaching this method requires extreme caution due to potential risks and legal implications.

Before diving in:

- **Understand the risks.**Online unlocking services operate in a gray area, potentially violating your carrier’s terms and conditions. This could lead to legal trouble or void your phone’s warranty.
- **Beware of scams.**Unfortunately, not all online unlocking services are legitimate. Many are scams designed to steal your money or personal information.
- **Do your research.**If you choose to proceed, thoroughly research the service provider. Read reviews from other users, check their track record, and ensure they have a good reputation.

These services typically require you to provide your phone’s IMEI number and pay a fee. They then claim to use various methods, often software or network vulnerabilities, to unlock your phone remotely. However, the success rate and security of these methods are highly questionable. Thus, relying on Dr.Fone as an alternative unlocking method is recommended.

## Conclusion

**Unlocking Telstra iPhones** gives you network flexibility, but navigating the process requires a measured approach. Remember, while Telstra’s official methods offer a guaranteed and secure path to freedom, third-party tools like Wondershare Dr.Fone present a potential avenue for those seeking alternative solutions.

After all, Wondershare Dr.Fone remains a valuable tool for your broader phone needs. From data recovery to system repair, its diverse functionalities can enhance your mobile experience in various ways. You can use it as an all-in-one application for all your needs, from network unlocking to system repair.

## Part 1: Can Cricket Locked Apple iPhone 11 Be Unlocked?

If you want to remove the carrier lock from your Apple iPhone 11, request **Cricket customer support for the network unlock code for free**. They’ll give it to you if they have it or can get it from the manufacturer. But first, make sure you meet the unlock requirements. The process depends on various factors, including your account status and the phone’s activation period.

If you are wondering whether there are other ways to do it aside from reaching out to their customer support, read on.

Different Ways To Unlock Cricket iPhone

Here’s an overview of the options available:

Cricket Network Unlock Code Free From Cricket Wireless

It is the most straightforward approach, but it comes with some restrictions. You must meet Cricket’s unlock policy requirements. If you fulfill these conditions, you can request a **Cricket unlock code for free** online.

Early Unlocking for Military Personnel

Good news if you’re in the military. You can ask their customer support to unlock your Apple iPhone 11, even if you haven’t used the service for six months. Having a **Cricket device unlocked** earlier is a way to help you stay connected during deployments.

Third-Party iPhone Unlocking Tools

Not all devices can be unlocked by Cricket if you don’t qualify for their requirements. However, paid online services and third-party apps can open up your options. These tools can help you use your phone on any compatible carrier, even if you don’t meet **Cricket device unlock** requirements.

While this option can be faster, choosing a reputable service provider and understanding the associated risks is crucial. Ensure it is legal in your region and won’t harm your phone’s functionality.

Ready to **unlock Cricket iPhone**? But wait, are you sure you meet the eligibility criteria? Let’s find out in the next section.

## Part 2: What Are the Requirements To Unlock Cricket iPhone?

You might be here because you are considering using your Cricket iPhone on other carriers. Unlocking allows switching wireless networks or increasing resale value. But before that, you need to meet the following requirements to **unlock Cricket iPhones** using the official method:

- Active service: The Cricket iPhone must have been active with paid service for at least six months.
- Device Lock: The device must be locked to the Cricket network. You can check the lock status by contacting Cricket customer support.

Exceptions for Active Military Personnel

If you’re in the military and can’t meet the six-month service rule, you can ask for a quick **device unlock from Cricket**. But there are still other requirements to fulfill, and you must show Cricket proof of your deployment. This proof can be military orders, deployment papers, or a letter from your commanding officer.

Eligibility checked? Great! Now, let’s continue and explore the different ways you can **unlock a Cricket iPhone**. We’ll start with online methods and then cover a section for military personnel.
