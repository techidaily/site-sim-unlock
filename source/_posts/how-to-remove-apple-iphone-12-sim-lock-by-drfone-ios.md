### Insert a new SIM card to unlock your device

- Turn off your device.
- SIM card out.

## What is iPhone Unlock Chip?

iPhone unlock chip is a microchip that unlocks the iPhones and makes them able to run on any network worldwide. When you buy an iPhone, it is either locked (unable to accept carrier) or factory unlocked (can accept any carrier). These unlock chips can bypass the carrier locks in iPhones and enable locked devices to work with any SIM.

An unlock chip is an easy and cheap way to get an Apple iPhone 12 to work with a different SIM card Using iPhone unlock chip enables the locked Apple iPhone 12 to call and send SMS using the local network sim card, just like a factory-unlocked phone does.
