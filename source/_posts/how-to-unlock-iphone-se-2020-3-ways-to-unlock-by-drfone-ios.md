Following are three methods to unlock Apple iPhone SE (2020)

### Method 1: Contact your carrier for unlock code

When a customer signs a contract with a big cell phone company for a certain amount of time, they often get a discount on a device. Because of this, the Apple iPhone SE (2020) device comes with a controller lock so customers can only use it on their network.

You can leave without paying anything if your agreement with the company is over. You must meet the following requirements before you can unlock your Apple iPhone SE (2020):

- Then you shouldn't have any debts in your bank account.
- If you signed a contract in exchange for a lower price upfront, you would have to wait until your contract ended (usually 24 months) or pay the remaining balance if you bought your phone on a payment plan.

Note: the unlocking process is different for each company.

**How to unlock the Apple iPhone SE (2020) locked by AT&T**

First, you need to know that AT&T limits how many devices a customer can unlock in a given year. Customers can unlock up to five devices per year if their account is in great condition.

- The device had used the T-Mobile network for at least 40 days before it was asked to be unlocked.

- The phone must have at least $50 worth of recharges paid for on prepaid plans.
- If you meet the above prerequisites, you can unlock an Apple iPhone SE (2020) carrier locked by a T-Mobile device by calling customer service at 611 from the Apple iPhone SE (2020) device you want to unlock.

**AppleiPhoneUnlock**

This website says that it can help you unlock your Apple iPhone SE (2020) or iPad. Please prepare your IMEI code and confirm the Apple iPhone SE (2020) device model.

If you own an iPhone that is MetroPCS-branded, the carrier will probably lock it, making it impossible to use a SIM from another carrier on the Apple iPhone SE (2020) device. Therefore, you will have to unlock iPhone MetroPCS for this purpose.

Many people find it difficult to unlock their MetroPCS iPhone and resort to buying a new phone altogether to use it with another service provider. In this article, you will learn how to use the MetroPCS unlock phones feature with three different methods. So, let’s get started!

- You would need a Boost mobile number or an account number that was last associated with the Apple iPhone SE (2020) device.
