It is important to note that not all phones are SIM locked. You can find out if yours is by checking the Honor X50i device's documentation. If you see the words "unlocked" on the initial receipt then you know that the Honor X50i device is not SIM locked.

Another easy way to find out is to ask your carrier if the Honor X50i device is locked on to their network. You can also just try inserting another carrier's SIM into your device. If it doesn't work, you will know that the Honor X50i device is SIM locked.

Before that the law didn't allow for carriers to unlock SIM cards in the United States. This unpopular law was reversed following a similar move by the European Union in 2013. The same law also requires that the carriers inform customers every month whether their device is eligible for unlocking.

If your device is eligible for unlocking, all you need to do is contact the carrier provide and request for the [sim network unlock pin](https://drfone.wondershare.com/unlock/unlock-samsung-sim-network-unlock-pin.html).
