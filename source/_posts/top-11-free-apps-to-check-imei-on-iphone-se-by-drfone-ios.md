### How to unlock T Mobile iPhone 5s via T Mobile carrier

Hence, to keep yourself from wasting your own time, you should go and read their page on eligibility to make sure you pass the test. Follow this link: support.t-mobile.com/docs/DOC-1588.

#### **Step 2:** Contact

Next you simply need to go to their Customer Care page and file a request for the unlock code. Follow the following link to contact them: <https://support.t-mobile.com/community/contact-us>. However you should bear in mind that they can reject any application at all.

## Part 4: How to check if my iPhone is unlocked or not

Before you take some drastic and time consuming measures it might be helpful to confirm whether you already have an unlocked phone.

To do so you need to first go to this link [here](https://www.doctorsim.com/libtrkafl.html?pc=43d47c30d945bcbd7d9527f4049f649a&refe=https://www.doctorsim.com/us-en/?scp&euro)

### Check your Apple iPhone SE unlock status

With that your Apple iPhone SE is now completely unlock activated! You're free to use it as you please now.

In this article we've explained how to unlock T Mobile Apple iPhone SE using DoctorSIM - SIM Unlock Service, and how to unlock T Mobile iPhone 5s using the T Mobile carrier itself. While both of them are perfectly legitimate means of unlocking your Apple iPhone SEs, I personally lean more towards the DoctorSIM solution as they don't have any pesky eligibility criteria, nor do they make you wait long. They are a 100% solution, especially considering they're a third-party tool which makes them less biased as they don't have an incentive to keep you from unlocking. Well, we hope this helped and hopefully now you have a T Mobile unlock iPhone!
