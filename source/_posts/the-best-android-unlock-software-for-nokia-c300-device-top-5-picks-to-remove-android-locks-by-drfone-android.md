## Ways To Find Unlocking Codes For Nokia C300 Phones

When you have a locked device, it is pretty much impossible to move from one network to another. This would cause problems if for instance you wanted to travel outside the country and want to switch to that country's carrier for the duration of your stay. Or maybe you just want to switch carriers because you don't like your current provider.

Whatever the reason, you should be able to unlock your device easily. But this has often proven difficult because of the fact that you need unlock codes. The problem is that many sites promise free unlocking codes for your device and many turn out to be fraudulent sites that use the word "free" in their advertising but actually require you to pay for the service. If you have been unsuccessfully searching for free unlocking codes for your device, look no further. This article compiles three of the best for Android and iPhone.

## Part 3: Popular Youtube Video for Unlocking Your Nokia C300

Here we've found a popular video on Youtube for you to follow and sim unlock your phone.

<iframe width="800" height="450" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/393YR8Hum5g" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0"></iframe>

It is very important to note that by unlocking your device you are breaching the contract you have with your service provider. Also, note that if the codes fail to work the first 4 times don't try to enter a fifth time as this will generally disable your device. This will mean that you will be unable to use the Nokia C300 device. Proceed with caution.

## Three Ways to Sim Unlock Nokia C300

You probably purchased your Nokia C300 for a significant discount but are now stuck with the same network for a couple of years. You loved the Nokia C300 device but your network provider does not have any plans that exactly suit your needs. To release your device from your current network's clutches, you will need to unlock your phone.

There are three ways you can do it and this post will go through each method so that you can find one that you are most comfortable with. Do note that if your contract has ended with your network provider, this "How to unlock Nokia C300" post can be skipped as you can just ask them to unlock your phone or purchase a [sim network unlock pin](https://drfone.wondershare.com/unlock/unlock-samsung-sim-network-unlock-pin.html) for a minimal price.

## Part 1: Nokia C300 Unlock Code

This is probably the easiest, no-fuss method to [sim unlock](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/unlock-android-screen/) Nokia C300. Follow these steps carefully to successfully perform Nokia C300 unlock code.

Do take note that this process may not work with your carrier. Therefore, always check if this is the right way to obtain the necessary code:

- 1\. Check the SIM lock status---you can do this by dialing **\*#\*#7378423#\*#\***.

![sony xperia unlock code](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2016/08/14707989592943.jpg)

- 2\. Tap **Service info** then **Sim lock**.

![unlock with sony xperia unlock code](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2016/08/14707989592897.jpg)

- 3\. The number beside **Network** indicates how many attempts you have to unlock the phone. If it says '7' it means you have seven attempts; '0' simply means it is hard locked and cannot be unlocked using this method.

## Part 3: Nokia C300 Unlock Carrier

If your Nokia C300 is hard locked, this is your best bet in getting your device unlocked. Actually, it is the safest method among all three:

1. Get a new SIM card from a new carrier.
2. Call your carrier's customer service line and ask what are the requirements to qualify you to get your Nokia C300 unlocked. If you have honored your contract, there should not be any problems. However, do ask your carrier if there are any additional requirements. Do note that there may be fees involved.
3. Once your customer service representative has determined if you have met all their requirements, they should give you the SIM network unlock PIN Nokia C300. Again, depending on your carrier, they might either give you the code over the phone, through email or via SMS. If you have the choice, always opt for email or SMS so that you are able to jot down the right number.
4. Once you have gotten the code, insert the new SIM card (from your new carrier). You will receive a prompt to enter your code. Make sure that you key in the right code---entering the wrong code will cause your phone to be locked (possibly forever).

## Part 4: Nokia C300 Unlock App/Software

There are some of us out there who are just not confident with doing things ourselves or trusting our own carrier.

HOWEVER, if your first instinct is to head to Google Play to look for SIM unlock tools, heed these cautions. There are currently many apps that claim that they can unlock your phone but it is just a scam. You should also avoid torrent files available online. These apps and software are usually laced with Trojans and other types of malware. So do sort through the reviews so that you will not fall into a malicious trap.

One that we can attest to is  **[MyMobileUnlocking.com](http://mymobileunlocking.com/)**; it is fast and affordable. Here is how you can unlock your Nokia C300:

- Choose your Country from the dropdown menu and click the  **Confirm country** button.

## Part 5: The benefits of an unlocked Nokia C300

If you now know how to unlock Nokia C300 but still do not know its advantages, we are here to help.

As indicated in the introduction, unlocked phone users can freely choose the plans they subscribed to---on any carriers, in any country. Therefore, if you travel frequently around the world, having an unlocked Nokia C300 would be beneficial. Using a local SIM card is much cheaper than paying for exorbitant roaming charges.

You can also benefit from an unlocked Nokia C300 if you are the kind of person who likes to take advantage of current offers provided by your local carriers. Prepaid plans are always changing in terms of offering so having the flexibility of changing carriers and prepaid plans can help you save money in the long run.

## Part 6: The downside of an unlocked Nokia C300

Are you thinking "Well, why can't I just buy an unlocked Nokia C300 in the first place?" right about now? Well, you can but think of the amount of money it will cost you.

For example, in Australia, an unlocked Nokia C300 will cost around $499 from any Nokia outlet but $0 for the Nokia C300 device when you pair it with a 24-month postpaid plan. While this may look attractive now, you may be paying more for a locked Nokia C300 in the long run.

## Conclusion

Now that you know the three ways of unlocking your Nokia C300, all you need to do is find one that is most compatible with you. Just remember to think of everything through and carefully. Most importantly, if you have a locked device, always seek advice from your carrier to see if this is possible.
