## Part 3: Infinix Hot 40 Unlock Carrier

If your Infinix Hot 40 is hard locked, this is your best bet in getting your device unlocked. Actually, it is the safest method among all three:

1. Get a new SIM card from a new carrier.
2. Call your carrier's customer service line and ask what are the requirements to qualify you to get your Infinix Hot 40 unlocked. If you have honored your contract, there should not be any problems. However, do ask your carrier if there are any additional requirements. Do note that there may be fees involved.
3. Once your customer service representative has determined if you have met all their requirements, they should give you the SIM network unlock PIN Infinix Hot 40. Again, depending on your carrier, they might either give you the code over the phone, through email or via SMS. If you have the choice, always opt for email or SMS so that you are able to jot down the right number.
4. Once you have gotten the code, insert the new SIM card (from your new carrier). You will receive a prompt to enter your code. Make sure that you key in the right code---entering the wrong code will cause your phone to be locked (possibly forever).

## Part 4: Infinix Hot 40 Unlock App/Software

There are some of us out there who are just not confident with doing things ourselves or trusting our own carrier.

## Part 5: The benefits of an unlocked Infinix Hot 40

If you now know how to unlock Infinix Hot 40 but still do not know its advantages, we are here to help.

As indicated in the introduction, unlocked phone users can freely choose the plans they subscribed to---on any carriers, in any country. Therefore, if you travel frequently around the world, having an unlocked Infinix Hot 40 would be beneficial. Using a local SIM card is much cheaper than paying for exorbitant roaming charges.

You can also benefit from an unlocked Infinix Hot 40 if you are the kind of person who likes to take advantage of current offers provided by your local carriers. Prepaid plans are always changing in terms of offering so having the flexibility of changing carriers and prepaid plans can help you save money in the long run.

## Part 6: The downside of an unlocked Infinix Hot 40

Are you thinking "Well, why can't I just buy an unlocked Infinix Hot 40 in the first place?" right about now? Well, you can but think of the amount of money it will cost you.

For example, in Australia, an unlocked Infinix Hot 40 will cost around $499 from any Infinix outlet but $0 for the Infinix Hot 40 device when you pair it with a 24-month postpaid plan. While this may look attractive now, you may be paying more for a locked Infinix Hot 40 in the long run.

### Method 2: Unlocking With Your Carrier’s Official Methods

As mentioned earlier, carriers often provide official routes to unlock their devices. While typically requiring compliance with specific criteria, this method ensures you stay within your carrier’s policies.

Most carriers offer two common methods for unlocking their phones:

- **Paying an upfront fee.**If your contract period is still ongoing, certain carriers allow unlocking upon payment of a predetermined fee. Check your carrier’s website or contact customer support for eligibility and fee details.
- **Requesting a SIM unlock.**Once your contract has expired and you meet the carrier’s eligibility criteria (e.g., device payment completion), you can submit an official unlock request. Carriers typically have dedicated online portals or customer service channels for this process.

Remember, each carrier has its policies and procedures regarding unlocking. Consult your carrier’s official website or contact customer support for specific instructions and eligibility requirements.

## Conclusion

Navigating the world of phone locks and restrictions can be daunting, but with the right information, you can unlock your device’s full potential. Of course, this guide taught you **how to check if your phone is unlocked** or not. Further, it taught you how to unlock it through official carrier channels or a trustworthy third-party tool like Wondershare Dr.Fone.
