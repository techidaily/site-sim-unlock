## Part 5: The benefits of an unlocked OnePlus Ace 2 Pro

If you now know how to unlock OnePlus Ace 2 Pro but still do not know its advantages, we are here to help.

As indicated in the introduction, unlocked phone users can freely choose the plans they subscribed to---on any carriers, in any country. Therefore, if you travel frequently around the world, having an unlocked OnePlus Ace 2 Pro would be beneficial. Using a local SIM card is much cheaper than paying for exorbitant roaming charges.

You can also benefit from an unlocked OnePlus Ace 2 Pro if you are the kind of person who likes to take advantage of current offers provided by your local carriers. Prepaid plans are always changing in terms of offering so having the flexibility of changing carriers and prepaid plans can help you save money in the long run.

## Part 6: The downside of an unlocked OnePlus Ace 2 Pro

Are you thinking "Well, why can't I just buy an unlocked OnePlus Ace 2 Pro in the first place?" right about now? Well, you can but think of the amount of money it will cost you.

For example, in Australia, an unlocked OnePlus Ace 2 Pro will cost around $499 from any OnePlus outlet but $0 for the OnePlus Ace 2 Pro device when you pair it with a 24-month postpaid plan. While this may look attractive now, you may be paying more for a locked OnePlus Ace 2 Pro in the long run.
