## Tutorial to Change Oppo A56s 5G IMEI without Root: A Comprehensive Guide

As an Android device user, you may have come across a situation where you need to change your device IMEI number. The International Mobile Equipment Identity (IMEI) is a unique 15-digit number assigned to every mobile device, such as smartphones and tablets. This number serves as an identifier, helping to distinguish your device from millions of others. One of the main reasons people want to change their Android IMEI number is to unblock a device that has been blacklisted by their network provider. Other reasons include accessing certain network features and services or maintaining anonymity.

Changing your Android IMEI without root access may seem like a daunting task, but this comprehensive guide will walk you through the process step-by-step. Before proceeding, please note that altering your device's IMEI number can be illegal in some countries, and may void your warranty. Proceed with caution and at your own risk. Get to know **how to change IMEI number** now!

## Part 1: What is IMEI and Why People Change The IMEI Number

The International Mobile Equipment Identity (IMEI) is a unique identifier for every mobile device. It allows network providers and manufacturers to track and block devices if they are reported as lost or stolen. Changing your device's IMEI can help to unblock a blacklisted device, access certain network features and services, or maintain anonymity. However, be aware that altering your IMEI number is illegal in some countries and may void your warranty.

![imei number](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/05/imei-number.jpg)

### There are several uses of the IMEI number

1. As the use of mobile devices increases, the statistics of stolen and lost devices have been increasing as well. Users can block stolen or lost devices for further usage if they know their IMEI number. All users need to call their network carrier and report that the Oppo A56s 5G device is stolen or lost. The carrier can block the specific device from running on their network and notify other carriers.
2. The 15-digit IMEI number indicates the origin and model of the Oppo A56s 5G device. The first eight digits indicate the Oppo A56s 5G device's origin and its model while the last six digits identify the Oppo A56s 5G device's manufacturer.
3. If you subscribe to a mobile tracking service, you can use the IMEI number to track the Oppo A56s 5G device---even if it uses a different SIM card.

### Pros and Cons of Changing Android IMEI

Like many other things out there, changing Android IMEI has both advantages and disadvantages. Here are some of them:

**Advantages**

1. Make your Android untraceable. By constantly changing your IMEI, you will throw off the tracks of people using it to stalk you!
2. Fix any invalid IMEI-related issues such as lost or invalid IMEI numbers. Once you change your IMEI, your Android device with the same benefits and features.
3. Obtaining a completely new device ID.
4. Changing the IMEI number to one that indicates it is a newer model, you will be able to enjoy new OS updates by resetting, repairing, and updating your Android device.
5. Have you ever yearned for that cheap BlackBerry plan your network carrier keeps on promoting? The 15-digit IMEI indicates the origin and model of your device. Therefore, by changing your Android's IMEI number to that of a BlackBerry's, you will be able to subscribe to a cheaper mobile plan.

**Disadvantages**

1. Before we begin, we need to make it clear that the process of changing IMEI without root can be illegal in some countries. We advise you to check the laws and regulations in your country before attempting to change your device’s IMEI number. As far as we know, it is legal in Africa and Asia, and illegal in Europe.
2. The IMEI number is hardcoded into your device. Therefore, changing your device’s IMEI number may void your device warranty and cause other issues such as network problems and software instability.
3. Legally, you have forfeited your ownership of your mobile device. When you purchase your device, the seller will jot down the original IMEI number on your receipt. So if you changed your IMEI and lost it, you may not be able to claim it. This is because authorities cannot see if it is truly yours. After all, the IMEI numbers no longer correlate with each other.

### Method 1: Locate IMEI through the Settings App

Another quick method to find the IMEI number is by using the dialer app on your Android smartphone. Here's how:

### Method 4: Find IMEI on a Removable Battery (for older devices)

For older Android devices with removable batteries, you can find the IMEI number printed on a sticker underneath the battery. To locate it, follow these steps:

## Part 3: Does IMEI Change With SIM Card?

No, swapping or changing the SIM card does not alter the IMEI (International Mobile Equipment Identity). The IMEI persists unchanged throughout the Oppo A56s 5G device's lifetime, functioning as a distinctive identifier solely for that particular device.

The IMEI is a 15-digit code assigned to each mobile device. It's separate from the SIM card, which stores information related to the subscriber and the carrier network. The SIM card contains data specific to the subscriber. This includes contacts, text messages, and network-related information. But it does not alter or affect the IMEI of the Oppo A56s 5G device.

The IMEI remains the same even if you change SIM cards or switch between different carriers. It's essentially a static identifier tied to the Oppo A56s 5G device's hardware. It is used by mobile networks and authorities to identify and track devices on the network.

## Part 4: Does IMEI Change After Factory Reset?

No, performing a factory reset on your mobile device does not change its IMEI (International Mobile Equipment Identity). The IMEI is a unique identifier assigned to the hardware of the Oppo A56s 5G device. It remains constant throughout the life of the Oppo A56s 5G device, irrespective of any software changes or resets.

A factory reset wipes the data and settings on your device, returning it to its original factory state. This process erases user-installed apps, personal data, and settings. But it doesn’t affect the Oppo A56s 5G device's hardware identification, including the IMEI.

The IMEI is embedded into the hardware of the Oppo A56s 5G device. It is typically printed on the Oppo A56s 5G device's packaging or can be found by dialing \*#06# on the phone's keypad. It's a crucial identifier for mobile networks, and authorities use it to uniquely identify and track devices across networks. It remains unchanged even after a factory reset.

### 2\. Unlock Base

Website URL: [https://www.unlockbase.com/wholesale-phone-unlocking](https://www.unlockbase.com/wholesale-phone-unlocking)

This service will unlock almost all devices, both Android and iPhone. It is also very fast and reliable. But perhaps the best feature of this service is that you can be aware of just how much you will have to spend to unlock your device long before you place the order.

To use the service, simply go to the main home page and check on the table provided how long it will take for your device to be unlocked and how much you have to pay. If you are happy with both estimates. Choose to unlock from the main menu and then proceed to select your device.

Once you have selected the Oppo A56s 5G device, enter the IMEI code, your email address, your country, and the network you are on. Then click on "Proceed to check out". Make payment and then wait for the assigned time for the [sim network unlock pin](https://drfone.wondershare.com/unlock/unlock-samsung-sim-network-unlock-pin.html) to be sent to the email address you provided.

### 3\. iPhone IMEI

Website URL: [https://iphoneimei.net/](https://appleiphoneunlock.uk/network/Special%20Services/Activation%20Lock?aff=wondershare)

This one is perhaps the easiest to use. It offers two services, one to check your iPhone's IMEI and the other to use the IMEI number to unlock the iPhone.

To use the service, select the “Unlock iPhone” on the homepage. Then select the model and the network the iPhone is locked to. Click “Unlock” to

continue.  You will be sent to a checkout page where you can pay the amount. The codes will be sent to the email address you provided at checkout.

### 4\. Doctor SIM

This is another website that can easily unlock just about any device model. It also offers an IMEI checker service as well as a lot of other helpful information about phone unlocking IMEI numbers and other issues related to devising unlocking.

To use it, click on "Unlock your Phone" in the main menu and select your device from the drop-down menu. You should see the amount you have to pay to unlock the Oppo A56s 5G device. Click on "Unlock your phone now" to continue.

In the next window, select your country and network provider and enter the phone's IMEI number and other information. Choose a payment method and then continue to check out. You will receive the codes at the email address you provided.

### 5\. Mobile Unlocked

Website URL: [https://www.mobileunlocked.com/](https://www.mobileunlocked.com/)

This is another service that will also provide you with phone unlock codes at a price. Just like the others, we have seen it is very easy to use and supports all devices.

To use it, select the “Unlock” option from the main menu and then choose your device's model from the drop-down menu.  Next, provide your device's details and then proceed to pay for the service and provide your name, email address, and IMEI number.

Once you click on “unlock now” all you have to do is wait the stipulated time for the codes to be sent to you.

![SIM unlock service](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2016/06/14670574555007.jpg)

### 6\. Cell Unlocker

Website URL: [http://www.cellunlocker.net/](http://www.cellunlocker.net/)

This service will also offer to unlock services at a price. The service unlocks all devices, including the iPhone, and they pride themselves on providing excellent service in the shortest period.  They also offer a 100% guarantee that they offer this service at the lowest price in the market.

To use this service, select "Unlock your Device" from the main menu and then select your device model from the list provided. There is a lot of information to read through, but when you scroll down a bit, you should be able to enter the Oppo A56s 5G device's information and then click on "look for code"

You will be directed to a payment page where you can make your payment.  The codes will be sent to you in a few days.
