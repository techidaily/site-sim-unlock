The next step is to find a reputable service that will unlock your Android device for you. This is action you should take only if you are absolutely desperate and your carrier can't unlock your device for you. This is because many of these sites are unregulated and many of them are not reliable.

You should also know that many of them will charge a certain amount for your service. You can try <https://www.safeunlockcode.com/> which is one of the more reputable ones we have found.

![android SIM unlock-safeunlockcode](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2016/06/14670084936436.jpg)

You will need to enter the IMEI number as part of the information you need to provide before they can unlock your device.

## Part 3: Troubleshooting Android SIM Unlock

There are lots of issues you may face when you try to unlock your device. The following are just some of the troubleshooting actions you can take if you encounter these problems.

**_Unlocking Code Fails to work_**

If you asked your carrier to unlock your device for you, chances are that they sent you a code. If the unlocking code fails to work double check that the IMEI number you used is the correct one and ensure that you purchased that device from that carrier and then try again.

**_Samsung Device Freezes during unlocking_**

If your device freezes during the unlocking process it typically means that you entered wrong unlocking code too many times. In this case you need to contact the carrier for a Master Code.

**_My LG device won't unlock_**

There are some LG models that cannot be unlocked. These models include LG U300, LG U310, LG U8180, LG U8330, LG U8120, LG U8360, LG U8380, LGU880, and LG U890. If your device is one of these it can't be unlocked by your carrier. You may need to look into other ways of unlocking your device.
