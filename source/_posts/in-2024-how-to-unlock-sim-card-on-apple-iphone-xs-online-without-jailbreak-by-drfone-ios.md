## How to Unlock SIM Card on Apple iPhone XS online without jailbreak

Isn't it so frustrating when you try to change your SIM or your network, but just can't because your phone is locked under contract? Phones are our life source in this global age, it's our tether to reality, to the world! But if you have a carrier locked phone, then that connection is basically under contract by an external agency! You can't change your networks, there are limitations on how you use your phone, and when you have to travel abroad you have no option other than paying the roaming charges. If you, say, have an iPhone 5c and have these frustrations, it's likely you're already wondering how to unlock the Apple iPhone XS 5c.

Chances are that if you've had a carrier locked phone for a while, you might have already forgotten what cellular freedom feels like. But we're here to remind you. All you have to do is break that carrier-lock, and you're good to go. However, you should be careful when doing so, cause if you try using a jailbreaking technique, it could have major repercussions. So we're here to give you some valuable advice about how to unlock iPhone 5, iPhone 5c, or even Android phones.

## Part 1: Unlock SIM Card on iPhone and Android via jailbreak

Before we get into telling you how to unlock iPhone 5, or the SIM Card on iPhone or Android, we should first tell you what Jailbreaking is. You might have heard of this term before, and I'm sure it sounded ominous to you. Jailbreak? It sounds awfully close to 'Prison break.' Well, considering the carrier lock is sort of like a prison for your cell, it is an accurate terminology. But Jailbreak isn't just about breaking the carrier lock. That might happen as a by-product, but the real purpose is to break free of the software restrictions which are generally applied to Apple devices. This might seem like a good option because, well, who doesn't want to break free of all of Apple's restrictions? But that always comes at several heavy risks.

### Threats of unlocking SIM via Jailbreak

#### 1\. Not Permanent

This has got to be one of the biggest reasons for not jailbreaking your phone. It is not at all permanent! In fact, the moment you update your system, your jailbreak is lost and if you've started using a different SIM it will no longer function, and you're gonna have to go back to using that Carrier you tried so hard to escape from! It's really not worth the effort. Of course, you could stop updating altogether, but then that will bring us to…

![Unlock SIM Card on iPhone and Android via jailbreak](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2016/10/14771444107532.jpg)

#### 2\. Risky

If you don't update your iOS, or Mac or iPad or any device at all, in this day and age, you're basically just asking to be hacked. That is not to excuse those who do the hacking and plant malware on your system, but if you leave your front door open in a shitty neighborhood, well then you only have yourself to blame once you get robbed!

#### 3\. Warranty

Jailbreaking has now become kind-of-legal, in a very tenuous sense, but that doesn't mean Apple wholeheartedly welcomes jailbreaking. If you do so, you will never again be able to avail of the warranty on your phone. And with the kind of major bucks you have to shell out for those iPhones, you best keep that warranty intact.

#### 4\. Lack of Apps

Many top-notch and crucial app companies and organizations simply refuse to make their applications usable in jailbreak phones, as they are extremely risky and prone to hacking. As a result, you would have to rely on a bunch of non-professional apps made by amateurs, which is more likely to put your phone in harm's way.

#### 5\. Bricking

This basically means your whole system may crash and stop functioning. As a result, you're gonna' have to restore the whole thing and try to salvage whatever information you can. Now those who do jailbreak regularly will give you all kinds of excuses like it happens only rarely or that you can retrieve your data simply from the cloud, et al. But do you really want to divest all your time and energy trying to fight off malware, backing up all your data, etc, especially when there is a much more convenient option just around the corner?

Didn't think so.

The factory lock is removed quickly when an unlock chip is put into your Apple iPhone XS. An iPhone Unlock Chip fools your Apple iPhone XS into thinking it only uses a Cricket SIM card. The Apple iPhone XS Unlock Chip has the structure to fake the iPhone's IMEI number and the authentication key, which allows it to work with any GSM Service.

Putting an iPhone Unlock Chip around your regular SIM card changes how your Apple iPhone XS and SIM card talk to each other. So, the unlock chip's controller fakes the IMSI number, which allows you to use other mobile networks.

Unfortunately, many iPhone unlock chips require a jailbroken iPhone before being used. Even if your Apple iPhone XS isn't jailbroken, you can still use an iPhone unlock chip to access some of its features.

There are several places to find information about jailbreaking an iPhone. After selecting, you can program your Apple iPhone XS's unlock chip by following the on-screen instructions.

## Part2: How to Unlock Boost Mobile iPhone with Boost Customers Service

The Boost phones are locked with their network, the company has an official way by which you can unlock your devices provided you meet the edibility criteria. The Boost mobile phones run on the CDMA network and most of the latest phones are cross-compatible with all the carriers.

If you are planning to unlock your Boost mobile using the official method, you would need to meet up the eligibility requirements. The company will not notify you regarding eligibility criteria and thus you need to do your homework and find them all on your own. In this regard, we are here to help you and have listed the requirements you need to unlock your device as below.

- The mobile must have been used and operational for at least a period of 12 months with the Boost Mobile network.
- For the 12-month activation anniversary, the payment must be made within the last 90 days.
- The phone should not be reported as lost or stolen.
- The phone must be capable of SIM unlock (though most of the phones are).
- The account standing of your Boost Mobile should be good which means there should be no unpaid bills.

_**Tip**: Boost mobile and similar other carriers have an online compatibility checker function that can let you check if your device will work on their network or not._

The following are the procedures for unlocking Boost phones in different scenarios

### Unlocking Boost Phone- Military Requirements

For the military personnel, the **Boost Mobile SIM unlock** will be done after the proof of deployment is submitted. Also, for the military people, there is no restriction about the minimum amount of time the Apple iPhone XS device should be used with the Boost mobile. A military account number is allowed for unlocking up to 2 devices in a year.

### Unlocking Boost Phone for current existing Boost customers

If you are a current customer of Boost and meet all the unlocking eligibility criteria then the process to get your device to unlock involves the following steps.

Step 1. Call the Boost customer service contact number.

Step 2. You will be provided with a **Boost mobile network unlock code**.

Step 3. You need to input the provided code and your device will be unlocked.

Note: For the BoostUP! For installment plan holders, the **Boost Mobile unlock Sim card** process will be done in a day while for the others it might take around 2 days.

A few points that need to be taken care of during the unlocking process are as follows:

- Ensure that your SIM card is in your phone else if you replace or remove the SIM card, your unlocking request might fail.
- Also, make sure that your device during the phase is turned on and is also connected with the Boost Mobile Network or to a WiFi network.

Unlocking phones for the Non-Boost Customers

If you are currently not a Boost customer and have been a customer earlier or have never been a customer and have purchased from a previous owner, you can still get your phone unlocked, though the process becomes a little complicated and the following are the requirements.

- You would need a Boost mobile number or an account number that was last associated with the Apple iPhone XS device.
- In case you do not have the number, then you will have to get in touch with the previous owner and get these details.

And in case you do not meet either of the above two situations, **Boost mobile carrier unlock** on your device cannot be done and you will first need to use the Boost network for the required time and get yourself eligible for the unlocking process.

_**Tip**: Another important point to consider before buying a device from a third party is to check with the Boost Mobile if the phone is unlocked or if it is eligible. In case you come to know that your device cannot be unlocked, you will not have to worry about the eligibility criteria or requirements._
