## Three Ways to Sim Unlock Samsung Galaxy A24

You probably purchased your Samsung Galaxy A24 for a significant discount but are now stuck with the same network for a couple of years. You loved the Samsung Galaxy A24 device but your network provider does not have any plans that exactly suit your needs. To release your device from your current network's clutches, you will need to unlock your phone.

There are three ways you can do it and this post will go through each method so that you can find one that you are most comfortable with. Do note that if your contract has ended with your network provider, this "How to unlock Samsung Galaxy A24" post can be skipped as you can just ask them to unlock your phone or purchase a [sim network unlock pin](https://drfone.wondershare.com/unlock/unlock-samsung-sim-network-unlock-pin.html) for a minimal price.

## Part 1: Samsung Galaxy A24 Unlock Code

This is probably the easiest, no-fuss method to [sim unlock](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/unlock-android-screen/) Samsung Galaxy A24. Follow these steps carefully to successfully perform Samsung Galaxy A24 unlock code.

Do take note that this process may not work with your carrier. Therefore, always check if this is the right way to obtain the necessary code:

- 1\. Check the SIM lock status---you can do this by dialing **\*#\*#7378423#\*#\***.

![sony xperia unlock code](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2016/08/14707989592943.jpg)

## Part 2: The Best Samsung Galaxy A24 SIM Unlock Code Generator

To safely and successfully sim unlock your Samsung Galaxy A24, it is important to find a trustworthy [sim network unlock pin software](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/unlock-android-screen/).

## Part 3: Samsung Galaxy A24 Unlock Carrier

If your Samsung Galaxy A24 is hard locked, this is your best bet in getting your device unlocked. Actually, it is the safest method among all three:

1. Get a new SIM card from a new carrier.
2. Call your carrier's customer service line and ask what are the requirements to qualify you to get your Samsung Galaxy A24 unlocked. If you have honored your contract, there should not be any problems. However, do ask your carrier if there are any additional requirements. Do note that there may be fees involved.
3. Once your customer service representative has determined if you have met all their requirements, they should give you the SIM network unlock PIN Samsung Galaxy A24.

## Part 5: The benefits of an unlocked Samsung Galaxy A24

If you now know how to unlock Samsung Galaxy A24 but still do not know its advantages, we are here to help.

As indicated in the introduction, unlocked phone users can freely choose the plans they subscribed to---on any carriers, in any country. Therefore, if you travel frequently around the world, having an unlocked Samsung Galaxy A24 would be beneficial. Using a local SIM card is much cheaper than paying for exorbitant roaming charges.

Prepaid plans are always changing in terms of offering so having the flexibility of changing carriers and prepaid plans can help you save money in the long run.

## Part 6: The downside of an unlocked Samsung Galaxy A24

Are you thinking "Well, why can't I just buy an unlocked Samsung Galaxy A24 in the first place?" right about now? Well, you can but think of the amount of money it will cost you.

For example, in Australia, an unlocked Samsung Galaxy A24 will cost around $499 from any Samsung outlet but $0 for the Samsung Galaxy A24 device when you pair it with a 24-month postpaid plan.
