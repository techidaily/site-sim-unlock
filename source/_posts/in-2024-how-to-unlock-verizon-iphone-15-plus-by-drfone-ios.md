## Part 4: How to unlock Verizon iPhone via Verizon

This is an alternative means by which you can unlock Verizon iPhone 5. However, before we show you how to unlock Verizon iPhone, we should probably answer some frequently asked questions about this.

#### Can Verizon iPhones be unlocked?

The long and short of this is: YES, Verizon iPhones can be unlocked.

#### Will Verizon Unlock my Phone?

Now here's the kicker. Verizon is actually one of the most relaxed carriers out there and they don't generally lock their devices to begin with. However, YES, if your device is locked, Verizon does offer the service to unlock your phone if you contact them.

#### How to unlock Verizon iPhone via Verizon

As mentioned above, Verizon is surprisingly lax when it comes to locking phones, especially iPhones. In fact all Verizon 4G LTE devices are never locked to begin with, you can directly use them with any other carriers. So, if you want to shift Carriers, they just have a bunch of requirements that you need to meet first:

1\. If the phone was purchased on a 2 year contract then your contract needs to be complete with all 24 months paid for.

2\. If the purchase of the Apple iPhone 15 Plus device was financed by Verizon Edge, or a two-year device payment plan, in that case you need to have paid off all overdue bills before you shift.

3\. The device shouldn't currently be reported as lost or stolen. Furthermore, if the Apple iPhone 15 Plus device has ever been associated with any form of fraudulent activity then you aren't eligible.

4\. And if your phone still seems locked for none of the stated reasons you just contact them directly and they'll take care of it. There is no complicated means of doing this.

If you meet these requirements then you don't need to bother unlocking it, you can simply use another carrier.

If this seems too good to be true, or you have trouble believing us, then head on over to their Unlocking Policies and read it for yourself, just follow this link: [http://www.verizon.com/about/consumer-safety/device-unlocking-policy](http://www.verizon.com/about/consumer-safety/device-unlocking-policy)
