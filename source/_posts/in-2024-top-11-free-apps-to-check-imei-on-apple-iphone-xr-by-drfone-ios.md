### The Bottom Line

So, these are the ways to find out if your Apple iPhone XR is locked and the four ways to unlock it if it is. You can get your Apple iPhone XR unlocked by calling your carrier. This is the official way to get rid of restrictions. If you don't want to use this method, you can unlock your Apple iPhone XR using some online websites.

But Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock (iOS) is one of the most trustworthy and easy-to-use programs that lets you unlock your device by taking a few simple steps.
