If you have a locked iPhone, we have different methods that entail how to unlock iPhone with IMEI code. Apart from this, we have two separate unlocking methods which usually confuse a good number of people. These methods are Sim Unlock and iCloud activation lock bypass.

**1.1 Dial \*#06#**

This is the primary method of checking your IMEI code on almost all devices. On your dial pad, dial \*#06# and press the call icon. Your unique code will be displayed immediately.

## How Do I SIM Unlock My Apple iPhone 13 Pro Max?

If your Apple iPhone 13 Pro Max is locked to a particular carrier, it can be very frustrating. This is because your device will only be able to work with a SIM card from that provider and no other. This can be a problem when you want to change carriers. Some iPhones are generally easier to unlock than others, and the easiest way to unlock any iPhone is usually to use a paid online service. The issue is that these services can be very expensive.

In this article, we are going to look at how you can [sim unlock](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/unlock-android-screen/) your Apple iPhone 13 Pro Max. It is however important to note that if you purchased your device in the last one year, it is already unlocked.

Many people may wonder whether it is legal to unlock the iPhone. Actually, it is perfectly legal to unlock your Apple iPhone 13 Pro Max if you have completed payments on the contract, or you bought the Apple iPhone 13 Pro Max device outright. If however, you are still in the process of paying for your contract, you don't fully own the phone and so you should contact the carrier before unlocking it.

##  Part 1: How to SIM Unlock Your Apple iPhone 13 Pro Max?

There are several ways to unlock your device. Let's look at a few of them.

### 1\. Contact your Carrier and Have them unlock the Apple iPhone 13 Pro Max device for you

This is probably the safest way to do it. If you have already completed payments on your Apple iPhone 13 Pro Max or you bought it outright, you can ask your carrier for the [sim network unlock pin](https://drfone.wondershare.com/unlock/unlock-samsung-sim-network-unlock-pin.html) to unlock your device. Depending on your carrier, you may have to pay for this service, and it also does take up to 7 days, sometimes more for them to get back to you.

### 2\. Software Unlocking

This is where you download a piece of [sim network unlock pin software](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/unlock-android-screen/) on to your device. This software makes changes to the Apple iPhone 13 Pro Max device, allowing you to make calls from any carrier. While this may sound straight-forward and easy, except it is highly risky and will not work for iPhone 4 and later models.

### 3\. Hardware Unlocking

This is where you alter the hardware of the Apple iPhone 13 Pro Max device to create an alternate path to deliver calls. Although this can be done, it also alters your device irreparably and probably also voids your warranty. Not to mention, you may pay more than $200 to have the Apple iPhone 13 Pro Max device unlocked in this way.

### 4\. IMEI unlocking

This is the best way to unlock your device and by far the easiest. This method uses your device's IMEI number to access the IMEI database and change the status of the Apple iPhone 13 Pro Max from locked to unlocked. There are very many services that you can use to IMEI unlock your device, and most of them will offer the service for a fee. But this is a great solution because there is no software to download, and you don't mess with the hardware in any way.

### Steps on How to Unlock Your Apple iPhone 13 Pro Max via IMEI

Like we mentioned before, there are a lot of services you can use to unlock your Apple iPhone 13 Pro Max. One of the best is [iPhoneIMEI.net](https://appleiphoneunlock.uk/network/Special%20Services/Activation%20Lock?aff=wondershare).

Step 2: Next, you will be required to enter your IMEI number and get details of the price and how long it will take for the code to be generated. Click on “Unlock Now” and you will be sent to a payment page where you can complete the payment.

Step 3. After the payment is successful, the system will send your Apple iPhone 13 Pro Max IMEI to the network provider and whitelist it from Apple activation database (You will be received an email for this change). This step may take 1–5 days.

## Part 2: The Best SIM Unlock Service - Dr.Fone

A SIM unlock PIN is an effective way to remove your SIM lock effectively. However, it may not work sometimes.

For instance, some network providers require only the original owner of the phone can get the code. So, if you have a second-hand contract iPhone, you can't find the unlock PIN. If your Apple iPhone 13 Pro Max is X/8(Plus)/7(Plus)/SE/6S(Plus)/6(Plus)/5S, luckily, I will introduce an amazing software to help unlock your SIM card permanently. That is [Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock (iOS)](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/iphone-unlock/).
