## 4 Best Methods to Unlock Apple iPhone 13 Pro Max

Following are three methods to unlock Apple iPhone 13 Pro Max

### Method 1: Contact your carrier for unlock code

When a customer signs a contract with a big cell phone company for a certain amount of time, they often get a discount on a device. Because of this, the Apple iPhone 13 Pro Max device comes with a controller lock so customers can only use it on their network.

You can leave without paying anything if your agreement with the company is over. You must meet the following requirements before you can unlock your Apple iPhone 13 Pro Max:

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![sim unlock pin](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/12/how-to-unlock-iphone-11-12-4.jpg)

- First, the Apple iPhone 13 Pro Max device must be legal. It means the Apple iPhone 13 Pro Max device has not been reported as lost, stolen, or connected to a crime.
- Then you shouldn't have any debts in your bank account.
- If you signed a contract in exchange for a lower price upfront, you would have to wait until your contract ended (usually 24 months) or pay the remaining balance if you bought your phone on a payment plan.

Note: the unlocking process is different for each company.

**How to unlock the Apple iPhone 13 Pro Max locked by AT&T**

First, you need to know that AT&T limits how many devices a customer can unlock in a given year. Customers can unlock up to five devices per year if their account is in great condition. Visit the AT&T support page for more information about how to unlock an AT&T device and if you meet the requirements.

**AT&T Unlocking security question**

- The full name of the person whose name is on the account
- Last four digits of the account holder's social security number
- AT&T passcode of the registered account owner if they have an online account.
- The IMEI number of the Apple iPhone 13 Pro Max is 11/12. The serial number of the Apple iPhone 13 Pro Max device is called the IMEI number. You can find it on the original packaging, under the battery, and on the back of some models, by dialing #06 or navigating to Settings > General > About.

**How to unlock the Apple iPhone 13 Pro Max locked by T-Mobile**

T-Mobile has set several standards that should be matched to complete an unlock request.

- The device must be completely paid off, and the account must be in great condition.
- In the past 12 months, less than two SIM unlock codes for each line have been asked for.
- The device had used the T-Mobile network for at least 40 days before it was asked to be unlocked.
- If you have a service contract and have made a payment for at least 18 consecutive months, or if you paid a relocation fee. There are a few special cases that Customer Service can explain in more detail if required.
- The phone must have at least $50 worth of recharges paid for on prepaid plans.
- If you meet the above prerequisites, you can unlock an Apple iPhone 13 Pro Max carrier locked by a T-Mobile device by calling customer service at 611 from the Apple iPhone 13 Pro Max device you want to unlock.
- Make sure you have ALL of the following information on tips when you call:

1. The main account holder's phone number
2. Account Password
3. Account holder's SSN's last four digits
4. IMEI number. You can find this by navigating Settings > General > About or dialing \*#06#.

### Method 2: Some SIM-unlock websites

Following are some popular SIM-Unlock websites you can consider to unlock your Apple iPhone 13 Pro Max.

**AppleiPhoneUnlock**

This website says that it can help you unlock your Apple iPhone 13 Pro Max or iPad. Please prepare your IMEI code and confirm the Apple iPhone 13 Pro Max device model. But when we did some research, I found that this website has some bad customer reviews. So, if you consider using them to unlock your Apple iPhone 13 Pro Max, you should be more careful in checking the availability.

### Method 3: Try a SIM-unlock chip

iPhone unlock chips allow iPhones to run on any network globally. Unlocking an iPhone with this option is a cheap and very easy way.

Unlock chip is a small SIM card that can be used along with regular SIM cards.

## Part 1: Basic information about IMEI number and ESN

### What is IMEI number?

IMEI (International Mobile Equipment Identity): IMEI numbers are unique to GSM (Global System for Mobile Communications) and UMTS (Universal Mobile Telecommunications System) network mobile phones. Unlike ESN, an IMEI number is 15 digits long. It serves as an anti-theft measure, meaning a blacklisted IMEI can result from a device being reported lost or stolen or a breach of the consumer agreement.

![iPhone imei number check](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/iphone-imei-check.jpg)

### What is an ESN?

Electronic Serial Number (ESN): Previously utilized by CDMA (Code Division Multiple Access) networks, an ESN was a unique identifier for cellular devices. With technological progression, most carriers have shifted their focus to the IMEI system, but knowing your ESNâs history is still crucial, especially if you're dealing with older devices.

### What is a Bad ESN?

A Bad ESN can mean a lot of things, letâs check out some examples:

1. If you hear this term most probably you are trying to activate the Apple iPhone 13 Pro Max device with a carrier, but thatâs not possible due to some reasons.
2. It can mean that the previous owner of the Apple iPhone 13 Pro Max device switched carriers.
3. The previous owner had an outstanding amount on their bill and cancelled the account without paying the bill first.
4. The previous owner didnât have a bill when they cancelled the account but they were still under a contract and if you cancel sooner than the due date for the contract, an "early termination fee" is created based on the remaining period of the contract and they hadnât paid that amount.
5. The person that sold you the phone or someone else who was the actual owner of the Apple iPhone 13 Pro Max device reported the Apple iPhone 13 Pro Max device as lost or stolen.

### What is a blacklisted IMEI?

Blacklisted IMEI is basically the same thing as Bad ESN but for devices that work on CDMA networks, like Verizon or Sprint. In short, the main reason that a device has a Blacklisted IMEI is so that you as the owner or someone else cannot activate the Apple iPhone 13 Pro Max device on any carrier, not even the original one, thus avoiding selling or stealing the phone.

1. **Appleâs Blacklist Status Tool:** Operating directly from Apple's official website, entering your IMEI number can provide instant clarity on its status.
2. **Network Carrier Services:** Another way is to contact the carrier that the Apple iPhone 13 Pro Max was initially sold from.

Just look for any carrier, Verizon, Sprint, T-Mobile, etc. Contacting your network carrier can also yield a blacklist status. Bear in mind that not all network services are equally adept or willing to communicate this information, and turnaround times may vary.
3. **Third-Party IMEI Check Services:** Utilizing third-party IMEI checkers is often the quickest method. These can be found as online services or apps, but itâs important to choose reputable sources. This is a highly recommended source to [check the status of your phone](https://www.doctorsim.com/libtrkafl.html?pc=43d47c30d945bcbd7d9527f4049f649a&refe=https://www.doctorsim.com/us-en/?scp&euro) because itâs quick, reliable and offers no fuss.

## Part 3: What to do if your Apple iPhone 13 Pro Max has bad ESN or blacklisted IMEI?

A bad ESN or blacklisted IMEI is serious business. It can result in a device being unusable on most of the surrounding networks. If your IMEI is blacklisted, there are steps for potential resolution:

### Ask the seller for a refund

If you bought the Apple iPhone 13 Pro Max device with the bad ESN newly from a retailer or online shop, you might be in luck as they can provide you with a refund or at least a replacement, depending on their policy. For example, Amazon and eBay have refund policies. Unfortunately, if you got the phone from someone you found on the street, or from a seller over sources like Craigslist, this might not be possible. But there are still other things you can do.

As such you can try and change the chips of your Apple iPhone 13 Pro Max. However, in doing so you should be prepared for some possible irreparable damage.

### Determine Hybrid GSM/CDMA Phones

If your phone cannot activate on a CDMA carrier like Verizon or Sprint, the IMEI can still be used on a GSM network.

Having a phone with bad ESN or blacklisted IMEI is naturally a headache, however, all hope isnât lost. You can do any of the things mentioned in the previous steps, and you can read on to find out how to unlock the phone with bad ESN or blacklisted IMEI.

## Part 4: How to unlock a phone with bad ESN or blacklisted IMEI?

Unlocking a phone with bad ESN or a blacklisted IMEI is not a single-step process. It involves both technological and legal maneuvering. It's important to note that unlocking a blacklisted phone might not make it fully operational, but it can help in using it with carriers outside the country where it was blacklisted.

### Understanding Lock Status

Before proceeding, ensure you understand the lock status of your phone. If the phone is network locked, it only works with a specific carrier. If it is blacklisted, itâs barred from most network use. An unlocked phone, on the other hand, is a blank slate ready to work with any carrier that supports the Apple iPhone 13 Pro Max device's technological specifications.

### Steps to Unlock

Here's a comprehensive overview of the steps to unlock a phone with a bad ESN or blacklisted IMEI:

1. ****Ascertain Legality:**** Ensure unlocking your phone is within the bounds of the law, both locally and globally. Legal provisions such as the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) in the US and similar laws elsewhere define the circumstances under which phone unlocking is legal.
2. ****Contact the Carrier:**** If the blacklisting issue has been resolved, contacting the carrier who blacklisted the Apple iPhone 13 Pro Max device is the most straightforward way to unlock it. They may require clear documentation proving ownership of the Apple iPhone 13 Pro Max device and the resolution of the reason for blacklisting.
3. ****Consider Third-Party Services:**** If your phone was blacklisted from a carrier in a different country where unlocking might be a common practice, third-party services can assist. Verify that they are reputable and have a solid track record, as well as a range of positive reviews from previous customers.
4. ****IMEI Repair and Unlock Tools:**** Some advanced users may consider IMEI repair software or unlock tools. However, utilizing these services could be illegal or fraudulent unless you are a certified technician who can verify the legitimacy of the software being used and the legality of the method in your region.
5. ****Seek Professional Repair Centers:**** If all else fails, there are mobile repair shops that specialize in this type of work. Itâs important to vet these services thoroughly, and ensure they are trained in such repairs and have a history of success.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### Considerations and Warnings

- ****Device Warranty:**** Unlocking a phone could void its warranty. Consider the cost-benefit of unlocking versus keeping the Apple iPhone 13 Pro Max device under warranty.
- ****Legal Ramifications:**** Unauthorized unlocking can have legal repercussions. Itâs important to research and ensure compliance with all relevant laws.
- ****Financial Risks:**** Some services come at a high cost, and there are scams in the market. Be cautious and only deal with recognized and trusted entities.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![iphone imei check](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/iphone-imei-check.jpg)

#### **Q: I am the owner of the Apple iPhone 13 Pro Max and I reported it as lost some time ago and I found it, can I cancel it?**

Yes, you can but most carriers will ask you to go to a retail store with at least one valid ID.

#### **Q: I dropped My Apple iPhone 13 Pro Max and the screen cracked. Does it now have a bad ESN?**

Hardware damage has no relation with an ESN. So your ESN status will remain unchanged.

#### **Q: Is it Legal to Unlock a Phone with a Bad ESN or Blacklisted IMEI?**

The legality of unlocking a phone with a bad ESN or blacklisted IMEI varies from country to country and can be influenced by specific case laws. However, in cases where the user is the original owner and the phone is paid off, it's typically legal to unlock the Apple iPhone 13 Pro Max device.

#### **Q: Can You Use a Blacklisted Phone Internationally?**

In some cases, a blacklisted phone can be used internationally. When a phone is blacklisted, it's typically barred from the carrier network where the blacklist was applied. However, different countries have different national blacklists, so it's possible that a phone blacklisted in one country will work in another. Unlocking the phone internationally can be an option here.

#### **Q: Can IMEI Cleaning Really Work?**

IMEI cleaning is the process by which the IMEI's blacklisted status is removed. There are services that offer to clean your IMEI, and while some may work, itâs important to understand the legality and efficacy of such services, as it may involve fraudulent activity and your phone may still not be fully operational on some networks even after being cleaned.

#### **Q: What Consequences Can I Face by Using a Blacklisted Phone?**

Using a blacklisted phone can have various consequences. It's unlikely to work on the network of the carrier where it was blacklisted, and the reliability of third-party carriers might be limited. Additionally, there may be legal implications, especially if the phone was blacklisted for being reported lost or stolen.

#### **Q: Should I Buy a Phone with a Bad ESN or Blacklisted IMEI?**

It's generally not advisable to purchase a phone with a bad ESN or blacklisted IMEI, as it would be difficult to use on most networks. Such devices are often sold at lower prices, but the risks and limitations associated with them might not be worth the discount.

Always research thoroughly and seek advice from reliable sources when taking the significant step of unlocking a phone with a bad ESN or blacklisted IMEI.

So now you know everything there is to know about IMEI, bad ESN, and blacklisted iPhones. You also know how to check their status using the handy Dr.Fone webpage or through contacting your carrier. And in case your Apple iPhone 13 Pro Max is erroneously locked and you canât access it, weâve also shown you how to unlock it using the [Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock (iOS)](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/iphone-unlock/) service tool.
