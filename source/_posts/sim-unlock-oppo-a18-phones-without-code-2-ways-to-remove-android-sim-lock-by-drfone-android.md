## Part 5: The benefits of an unlocked Oppo A18

If you now know how to unlock Oppo A18 but still do not know its advantages, we are here to help.

As indicated in the introduction, unlocked phone users can freely choose the plans they subscribed to---on any carriers, in any country. Therefore, if you travel frequently around the world, having an unlocked Oppo A18 would be beneficial. Using a local SIM card is much cheaper than paying for exorbitant roaming charges.

You can also benefit from an unlocked Oppo A18 if you are the kind of person who likes to take advantage of current offers provided by your local carriers. Prepaid plans are always changing in terms of offering so having the flexibility of changing carriers and prepaid plans can help you save money in the long run.

## Part 6: The downside of an unlocked Oppo A18

Are you thinking "Well, why can't I just buy an unlocked Oppo A18 in the first place?" right about now? Well, you can but think of the amount of money it will cost you.

For example, in Australia, an unlocked Oppo A18 will cost around $499 from any Oppo outlet but $0 for the Oppo A18 device when you pair it with a 24-month postpaid plan. While this may look attractive now, you may be paying more for a locked Oppo A18 in the long run.

## Part 1: Why Is Your Oppo A18 Asking for a SIM Network Unlock PIN?

You just bought a new phone, excited to use it with a new SIM card. But your phone pops up with a request for a PIN code to unlock it. What’s that all about, and what do you enter? There are two main reasons why your phone might be asking for a SIM PIN or unlock code:

SIM Network Lock

The SIM Network Lock is a restriction placed by your phone’s original network provider, locking it to their network. It means you can only use the Oppo A18 device with SIM cards from that specific carrier. Carriers use this to ensure that the phones they sell work only with their service. When you buy a subsidized phone, they want to ensure you stick around for the contract duration.

If you insert a SIM card from a different carrier, your phone will ask for a **SIM Network Unlock PIN** or Network Unlock Code (NUC). You’ll learn more about it in the upcoming sections of this article.

SIM Card Lock

SIM Card Lock is a security feature that protects your SIM card from unauthorized use on other devices. It requires you to enter a PIN (Personal Identification Number) to unlock the SIM card before you can use it.

The default PIN is usually printed on the back of the SIM card or its packaging. If you haven’t changed your PIN, use the 4-8 digit code provided by the carrier when you get your SIM card.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![sim card lock pin](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/02/sim-network-unlock-pin-02.jpg)

If you’ve forgotten the **SIM PIN code**, you can use the PUK (PIN Unlock Key) code to unlock the SIM and set a new PIN. The PUK code is also printed on the SIM card packaging, but be careful, as entering the wrong PUK code too many times can permanently lock the SIM card.

Not knowing the **SIM unlock PIN** code can be frustrating, especially if you want to switch mobile carriers. So, in the next part, we’ll explore whether it’s possible to unlock a SIM network-locked iPhone device.

## Part 2: Can a SIM Network Locked iPhone Be Unlocked?

Yes, a SIM network-locked iPhone can be unlocked by your network provider. Insert a new SIM card, and you’ll be prompted to enter the **SIM Network Unlock PIN**. After inputting the correct unlock code, your iPhone is ready to use with any carrier.

![sim not valid message on iphone](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/02/sim-network-unlock-pin-03.jpg)

If you are thinking about unlocking your iPhone, it’s crucial to grasp what a **SIM Network Unlock PIN** is and how it functions.

## Part 3: What Is a SIM Network Unlock PIN?

A **SIM network unlock PIN** is a code allowing you to remove your phone’s network lock. It means you can use your phone with a SIM card from any compatible network provider, not just the one you originally bought it from. It is also known as Network Unlock PIN (NUP), Network Control Key (NCK), or Network Unlock Code (NUC).

Unlocking your device can be useful if you:

- Bought a phone locked to a specific carrier and want to switch to a different one.
- Are planning a trip abroad and want to use a local SIM card instead.

![international travel illustration](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/02/sim-network-unlock-pin-04.jpg)

- Still haven’t finished your contract with your original carrier and want to keep the phone but use a different service.
- Bought a phone second-hand locked to the previous owner’s network.
- Want to increase your phone’s resale value; unlocked phones generally have a higher resale value than locked phones, as various buyers can use them.
- Want more carrier flexibility; you are not tied to one carrier and can choose the provider that best suits your needs in terms of price, coverage, data plans, and other features.

Things To Consider

Before you proceed, here are some key points to remember:

- Eligibility: Not all phones are eligible for network unlocking. Check with your carrier or manufacturer for details.
- Costs: While some carriers can give **SIM network unlock PIN for free**, others may charge a fee. Third-party unlocking services also typically charge a fee.
- Waiting time: It can take days or even weeks to receive your **SIM unlock PIN**code from your carrier and process it. For instance, Vodafone usually unlocks the Oppo A18 device within 72 hours to 10 days if they have to reach the manufacturer.
- Risks: Using an unauthorized unlocking method could damage your phone or void its warranty.
- Backup: Before unlocking your phone, back up your data, as the process may erase it.

Now that you understand **SIM Network Unlock PIN**, let’s get down to business! In the final part, we’ll guide you through the two ways of unlocking your iPhone for a new carrier.

## Part 4: How To Unlock Your iPhone for a New Carrier?

Ready to unlock your iPhone and explore your carrier options? Read on, and this part will break down each method step-by-step so you can choose the one that best suits your situation.

Method 1: Unlock SIM Card Without SIM Network Unlock Pin Fast

If you’re wondering about unlocking a second-hand iPhone, what to do if the carrier’s **SIM network unlock PIN** doesn’t work, or if you can’t wait for the network provider’s response, don’t worry. You have one of the best mobile solution apps to remove SIM lock available here.

[Wondershare Dr.Fone](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/drfone-toolkit/), a powerful mobile solution app, can simplify this process. Regardless of mobile carrier or purchase method, it can unlock your iPhone in a few minutes.

Important Considerations:

- Fone will not be able to remove the SIM lock if your iPhone’s mobile carrier blocks or blacklists the IMEI.
- Jailbreaking is necessary for SIM lock removal and can void your iPhone’s warranty.

So, if you plan to switch carriers without a **SIM network unlocks PIN** code, this method is a good fit for you. Follow these steps below to fix common issues like “SIM Not Supported” and “SIM Locked” with ease.

- **Step 1:** Download and install Dr.Fone on your computer. Connect your iPhone to your computer using a USB cable. Next, launch the app to set up your account, then from the **Toolbox** homepage, select **Screen Unlock**.

- **Step 2:** After you select **iOS** as your device type, choose the **Remove SIM Locked** option.

Method 2: Get a SIM Network Unlock Pin for Free From the Network Carrier

Requesting a **SIM network unlock PIN for free** is usually straightforward. iPhones purchased from carriers are often locked to their network for a certain period (AT&T and Verizon require 60 days).

- **Step 1:** Visit your carrier’s website or contact them to confirm if your phone is eligible for unlocking.
- **Step 2:** If eligible, submit a request through your carrier’s website or app. You may need to provide information like your IMEI number, account details, and proof of purchase.

![iphone device information](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/02/sim-network-unlock-pin-11.jpg)

- **Step 3:** Depending on your carrier, you might receive the unlock code after a few days or weeks. It might be delivered via email, text message, or online account.
- **Step 4:** Follow the instructions provided by your carrier for your phone model. It usually involves inserting a SIM card from a different carrier and entering the **SIM network unlock PIN** code when prompted.

Important notes:

- Some carriers may charge a fee for unlocking your phone and only unlock devices for customers in good standing with their accounts.
- Unlocking your phone may not be possible, depending on your contract, device financing, or other factors.
- Ensure you follow your carrier’s instructions for unlocking your phone model to avoid issues.

## Conclusion

Unlocking your phone opens a world of flexibility and potential savings. You’re free to choose any carrier, access more international roaming options, and even boost your phone’s resale value.

But remember, safety first! Avoid shady websites or unofficial tools promising instant unlocks. These can be risky and even harm your device.

Instead, opt for safe and legal methods. Contact your carrier directly to request a **SIM network unlock PIN** or use a reputable tool like Dr.Fone Remove SIM Lock. It offers a user-friendly interface and an efficient way to unlock your phone, empowering you to maximize your device usage.
