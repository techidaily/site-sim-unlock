## Part 2: How to SIM Unlock your Android Device

If you find that your SIM is locked, here's a few things you can do to unlock the Infinix Smart 8 Pro device.

Avoid all of the apps on the Google Play Store that promise to unlock your device, most of them don't work and may even harbour a lot of Trojans and malware that will cause further problems for you and your device.

There are safe and very legal ways to unlock your device. Just try one of the following.

**_Ask your Carrier to Unlock your Device_**

This is the best option when you want to safely unlock your device. By February 2015, American cell phone owners got the option to request their carriers to unlock their device for them. Before that the law didn't allow for carriers to unlock SIM cards in the United States. This unpopular law was reversed following a similar move by the European Union in 2013. The same law also requires that the carriers inform customers every month whether their device is eligible for unlocking.

If your device is eligible for unlocking, all you need to do is contact the carrier provide and request for the [sim network unlock pin](https://drfone.wondershare.com/unlock/unlock-samsung-sim-network-unlock-pin.html). But if your Smartphone was bought on a contract, you may need to pay a termination fee to break the contract of you want to unlock the Infinix Smart 8 Pro device before the contact term expires. For Smartphones that are not on contract, you have to wait 12 months from the date of purchase and ensure that your bill is paid before the carrier can give you the unlock code.

**_How to Unlock your Android Phone_**

To begin with, you need to confirm your IMEI number. Dial \*#06# on your device and the IMEI number will appear on the screen. Copy this number to a secure location or wrote it down somewhere.

You will need to enter the IMEI number as part of the information you need to provide before they can unlock your device.

## Part 3: Troubleshooting Android SIM Unlock

There are lots of issues you may face when you try to unlock your device. The following are just some of the troubleshooting actions you can take if you encounter these problems.

**_Unlocking Code Fails to work_**

If you asked your carrier to unlock your device for you, chances are that they sent you a code. If the unlocking code fails to work double check that the IMEI number you used is the correct one and ensure that you purchased that device from that carrier and then try again.

**_Samsung Device Freezes during unlocking_**

If your device freezes during the unlocking process it typically means that you entered wrong unlocking code too many times. In this case you need to contact the carrier for a Master Code.

**_My LG device won't unlock_**

There are some LG models that cannot be unlocked. These models include LG U300, LG U310, LG U8180, LG U8330, LG U8120, LG U8360, LG U8380, LGU880, and LG U890. If your device is one of these it can't be unlocked by your carrier. You may need to look into other ways of unlocking your device.
