1. _This app works !! Even better that is free! -- from App Store_
2. _I’m stuck in a loop where it keeps telling me to confirm my account with an email sent to me, then I try to log in after confirming and it tells me my account has not been fully set up. Kept going back and forth with the same issue so I gave up and deleted the app. Total garbage, will update when/if issue fixed. -- from App Store_
