Before you can unlock your Apple iPhone 8 Plus, you have to do the following:

First, it has to be legal. It means the Apple iPhone 8 Plus device has not been reported as lost, stolen, or linked to a crime.

Then your bank account shouldn't have any debts. If you signed a contract in exchange for a lower price upfront, you would have to wait until your contract was up (usually 24 months) or pay the remaining balance if you bought your phone on a payment plan. Each company has its way of unlocking.
