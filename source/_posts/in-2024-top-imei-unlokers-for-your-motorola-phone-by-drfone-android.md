## Part 5: The benefits of an unlocked Motorola G24 Power

If you now know how to unlock Motorola G24 Power but still do not know its advantages, we are here to help.

As indicated in the introduction, unlocked phone users can freely choose the plans they subscribed to---on any carriers, in any country. Therefore, if you travel frequently around the world, having an unlocked Motorola G24 Power would be beneficial. Using a local SIM card is much cheaper than paying for exorbitant roaming charges.

You can also benefit from an unlocked Motorola G24 Power if you are the kind of person who likes to take advantage of current offers provided by your local carriers. Prepaid plans are always changing in terms of offering so having the flexibility of changing carriers and prepaid plans can help you save money in the long run.

## Part 6: The downside of an unlocked Motorola G24 Power

Are you thinking "Well, why can't I just buy an unlocked Motorola G24 Power in the first place?" right about now? Well, you can but think of the amount of money it will cost you.

For example, in Australia, an unlocked Motorola G24 Power will cost around $499 from any Motorola outlet but $0 for the Motorola G24 Power device when you pair it with a 24-month postpaid plan. While this may look attractive now, you may be paying more for a locked Motorola G24 Power in the long run.

Most importantly, if you have a locked device, always seek advice from your carrier to see if this is possible.
