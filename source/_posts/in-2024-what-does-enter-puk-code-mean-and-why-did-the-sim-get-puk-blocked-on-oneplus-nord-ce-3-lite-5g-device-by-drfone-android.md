## What Does 'Enter PUK Code' Mean And Why Did The Sim Get PUK Blocked On OnePlus Nord CE 3 Lite 5G Device

If your SIM card is disabled, you probably entered the incorrect PIN code too frequently. Your SIM locks itself after three to five wrong inputs, on average. Although it might be annoying, doing these guards against unauthorized access to your phone and personal data. If your cell phone is lost or stolen, PUK blocked will prevent prospective hackers from making calls.

Your mobile phone display can say “PIN blocked” or "Enter PUK code." PUK stands for PIN Unblocking Key in the PUK code. The PUK code is seldom given to you when you receive your membership in the US. Contact Your OnePlus Nord CE 3 Lite 5G provider's customer support if you don't know your PUK code.

## Part 1: Why Was My Sim Card Blocked?

### 1\. 3 times incorrect Pin entered

Sometimes when you forget your pin and keep on entering the wrong one, you can get PUK Blocked. You can utilize three to five chances, and your sim gets blocked when you enter the incorrect pin in all of these attempts.

### 2\. Wrong PUK code entered

Sims are frequently blocked; therefore, if you have your PUK, keep it in a secure location separate from your phone. This is because it is the key to unlocking your SIM. The SIM will be permanently disabled, and you will have to buy a new SIM card if you input the wrong PUK ten times in a row.

## Part 2: What To Do When I Blocked My Sim Card?

Your SIM card has been disabled to protect your security if you enter three wrong PINs and your phone shows "SIM card banned" or "Enter PUK code".

You must input a PUK (PIN Unlock Key) code to unlock your SIM card.

Go to your phone's settings to customize your PIN code after using a PUK code to unlock your SIM card. Pick a PIN that is simple to remember.

If your PUK code was delivered to you by email:

You got an email with multiple codes, including PUK1, PIN2, and PUK2.

![go to settings and customize to unblock sim](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/10/how-to-unlock-puk-blocked-sim-card-1.jpg)

If your PIN is locked, use PUK1 to unlock it.

Only a few phones employ PIN2 and PUK2 codes to restrict access to certain SIM card functionalities.

PIN2: The default code for your SIM card; If this code has been altered, use the PUK2 code to restore it.

PUK2: Your PIN2's unlock code if it has been blocked.

## Part 3: How Can I Have My PUK Code To Unlock Sim Card?

### 1\. Get it from sim card packaging

The packing box is the best and easiest place to look for the PUK code to unlock your SIM card.

<!-- affiliate ads begin -->

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![sim card packaging to unlock sim card](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/10/how-to-unlock-puk-blocked-sim-card-2.jpg)

You probably have memories of the flat plastic package you got when you bought a SIM card. Your PUK and default SIM pin code should be written on the package.

![find the pin code on flat plastic package](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/10/how-to-unlock-puk-blocked-sim-card-3.jpg)

Please look around your home for the package and look on the back for the key. On some older packaging, it could be sealed behind a scratchable region, whereas on other, more recent ones, you might find it unsealed.

![look at the back of the package and find puk code](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/10/how-to-unlock-puk-blocked-sim-card-4.jpg)

In either case, the correct PUK has 8 numbers and should be simple to enter to unlock your SIM card.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### 2\. Have it from carrier website

In all honesty, I doubt I'll ever be able to locate my SIM card package again, and I imagine most people feel the same way.

But happily, a lot of cell companies let you access your account on their app or website to check your SIM card PUK. Please log in to the appropriate website or app, then go to your profile to see whether anything about "PUK" is available there.

![go to career website and check your sim card puk](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/10/how-to-unlock-puk-blocked-sim-card-5.jpg)

It shouldn't be an issue if you were utilizing or signed in to the platform before your SIM was disabled. However, if not, you might not be able to access anything since you could be asked to input an OTP to verify your identity.

Please remove the SIM card and try again if you can't access your phone to utilize the app or website because of the SIM lock. After receiving the PUK code, you can re-insert the SIM and input it.

<!-- affiliate ads begin -->
<a href="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/c/5597632/2084396/18498" target="_top" id="2084396"><img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18498-2084396" border="0" alt="" width="1920" height="700"/></a><img height="0" width="0" src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/2084396/18498" style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0" />
<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### 3\. Contact your carrier

It's time to call customer support, which should be simpler for most individuals if none of the above options work for you. For example, your mobile service provider created your SIM card. Therefore, they have all the information you would require. Before they divulge anything to you, though, they should be able to verify your identity.

Use a different phone to call your customer service number and describe the issue. And following a series of inquiries, they should offer your PUK number as identification.

![solve the sim card not accessed issue](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/10/how-to-unlock-puk-blocked-sim-card-6.jpg)

However, customer service won't release the code if you can't back yourself up. And at that point, there's probably nothing further you can do. Therefore, make sure you have some information, such as your name, address, date of birth, etc., before you call them.

## Part 4: Easy Tool For Sim Card Unlock

## How to Unlock SIM Card on OnePlus Nord CE 3 Lite 5G online without jailbreak

Isn't it so frustrating when you try to change your SIM or your network, but just can't because your phone is locked under contract? Phones are our life source in this global age, it's our tether to reality, to the world! But if you have a carrier locked phone, then that connection is basically under contract by an external agency! You can't change your networks, there are limitations on how you use your phone, and when you have to travel abroad you have no option other than paying the roaming charges. If you, say, have an iPhone 5c and have these frustrations, it's likely you're already wondering how to unlock the iPhone 5c.

Chances are that if you've had a carrier locked phone for a while, you might have already forgotten what cellular freedom feels like. But we're here to remind you. All you have to do is break that carrier-lock, and you're good to go. However, you should be careful when doing so, cause if you try using a jailbreaking technique, it could have major repercussions. So we're here to give you some valuable advice about how to unlock iPhone 5, iPhone 5c, or even Android phones.

## Part 1: Unlock SIM Card on OnePlus Nord CE 3 Lite 5G via jailbreak

Before we get into telling you how to unlock iPhone 5, or the SIM Card on iPhone or Android, we should first tell you what Jailbreaking is. You might have heard of this term before, and I'm sure it sounded ominous to you. Jailbreak? It sounds awfully close to 'Prison break.' Well, considering the carrier lock is sort of like a prison for your cell, it is an accurate terminology. But Jailbreak isn't just about breaking the carrier lock. That might happen as a by-product, but the real purpose is to break free of the software restrictions which are generally applied to Apple devices. This might seem like a good option because, well, who doesn't want to break free of all of Apple's restrictions? But that always comes at several heavy risks.

### Threats of unlocking SIM via Jailbreak

#### 1\. Not Permanent

This has got to be one of the biggest reasons for not jailbreaking your phone. It is not at all permanent! In fact, the moment you update your system, your jailbreak is lost and if you've started using a different SIM it will no longer function, and you're gonna have to go back to using that Carrier you tried so hard to escape from! It's really not worth the effort. Of course, you could stop updating altogether, but then that will bring us to…

![Unlock SIM Card on iPhone and Android via jailbreak](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2016/10/14771444107532.jpg)

#### 2\. Risky

If you don't update your iOS, or Mac or iPad or any device at all, in this day and age, you're basically just asking to be hacked. That is not to excuse those who do the hacking and plant malware on your system, but if you leave your front door open in a shitty neighborhood, well then you only have yourself to blame once you get robbed!

#### 3\. Warranty

Jailbreaking has now become kind-of-legal, in a very tenuous sense, but that doesn't mean Apple wholeheartedly welcomes jailbreaking. If you do so, you will never again be able to avail of the warranty on your phone. And with the kind of major bucks you have to shell out for those iPhones, you best keep that warranty intact.

#### 4\. Lack of Apps

Many top-notch and crucial app companies and organizations simply refuse to make their applications usable in jailbreak phones, as they are extremely risky and prone to hacking. As a result, you would have to rely on a bunch of non-professional apps made by amateurs, which is more likely to put your phone in harm's way.

#### 5\. Bricking

This basically means your whole system may crash and stop functioning. As a result, you're gonna' have to restore the whole thing and try to salvage whatever information you can. Now those who do jailbreak regularly will give you all kinds of excuses like it happens only rarely or that you can retrieve your data simply from the cloud, et al. But do you really want to divest all your time and energy trying to fight off malware, backing up all your data, etc, especially when there is a much more convenient option just around the corner?

Didn't think so.
