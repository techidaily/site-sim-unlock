The International Mobile Equipment Identity (IMEI) is a unique identifier for every mobile device. It allows network providers and manufacturers to track and block devices if they are reported as lost or stolen. Changing your device's IMEI can help to unblock a blacklisted device, access certain network features and services, or maintain anonymity. However, be aware that altering your IMEI number is illegal in some countries and may void your warranty.

### There are several uses of the IMEI number

1. As the use of mobile devices increases, the statistics of stolen and lost devices have been increasing as well. Users can block stolen or lost devices for further usage if they know their IMEI number. All users need to call their network carrier and report that the OnePlus Nord 3 5G device is stolen or lost. The carrier can block the specific device from running on their network and notify other carriers.
2. The 15-digit IMEI number indicates the origin and model of the OnePlus Nord 3 5G device. The first eight digits indicate the OnePlus Nord 3 5G device's origin and its model while the last six digits identify the OnePlus Nord 3 5G device's manufacturer.
3. If you subscribe to a mobile tracking service, you can use the IMEI number to track the OnePlus Nord 3 5G device---even if it uses a different SIM card.

### Pros and Cons of Changing Android IMEI

Like many other things out there, changing Android IMEI has both advantages and disadvantages. Here are some of them:

No, swapping or changing the SIM card does not alter the IMEI (International Mobile Equipment Identity). The IMEI persists unchanged throughout the OnePlus Nord 3 5G device's lifetime, functioning as a distinctive identifier solely for that particular device.

The IMEI is a 15-digit code assigned to each mobile device. It's separate from the SIM card, which stores information related to the subscriber and the carrier network. The SIM card contains data specific to the subscriber. This includes contacts, text messages, and network-related information. But it does not alter or affect the IMEI of the OnePlus Nord 3 5G device.

The IMEI remains the same even if you change SIM cards or switch between different carriers. It's essentially a static identifier tied to the OnePlus Nord 3 5G device's hardware. It is used by mobile networks and authorities to identify and track devices on the network.

## Part 4: Does IMEI Change After Factory Reset?

The IMEI is a unique identifier assigned to the hardware of the OnePlus Nord 3 5G device. It remains constant throughout the life of the OnePlus Nord 3 5G device, irrespective of any software changes or resets.

A factory reset wipes the data and settings on your device, returning it to its original factory state. This process erases user-installed apps, personal data, and settings. But it doesn’t affect the OnePlus Nord 3 5G device's hardware identification, including the IMEI.

The IMEI is embedded into the hardware of the OnePlus Nord 3 5G device. It is typically printed on the OnePlus Nord 3 5G device's packaging or can be found by dialing \*#06# on the phone's keypad. It's a crucial identifier for mobile networks, and authorities use it to uniquely identify and track devices across networks. It remains unchanged even after a factory reset.

By using the Android IMEI changer, you will neither lose your data nor need to root your device in your pursuit of changing your device's IMEI number. However, do remember that every situation is different, and there will come a time when you need to root your device before changing your Android's IMEI number. We advise you to use this tutorial only for legal purposes and to check the laws and regulations in your country before attempting to change your device’s IMEI number.

You will also need the IMEI number if you want to unlock your phone and use it on another carrier provider. There are a lot of [SIM Unlock services](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/unlock-android-screen/) out there. It is important to choose a trustworthy and workable service to unlock your phone.
