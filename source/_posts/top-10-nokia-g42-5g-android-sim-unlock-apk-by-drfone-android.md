There is an eligibility clause in contract for Smartphones bought on contract and if a specific time period is not up yet, then a termination fee is required to be paid by the user to break the contract in order to be able to use any SIM on the Nokia G42 5G device after getting the unlock code.

So, the phone can be unlocked remotely by using the special remote unlock codes.

**_Pros_**
