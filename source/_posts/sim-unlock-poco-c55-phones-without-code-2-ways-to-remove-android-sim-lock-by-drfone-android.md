Once your order is processed, the system will send you your personalized unlock code and unlocking instructions. You can then follow the instructions to unlock your Poco C55 phone. Easy!

## Part 2: Unlockitfree.com for free Poco unlock codes

Unlockitfree.com is a free remote unlock service, providing unlocking codes for Poco C55 phones and other models. They offer a fast and free service, but it is not always reliable.

### How to use the Unlockitfree.com Unlock Service?

1\. First, enter your phone’s unique IMEI into the site, and then the site checks to ensure that it is genuine.

2\. Choose your phone model from the list provided, and then choose your country. Once you choose your country, a list of supported Service Providers will pop up. Choose your service provider, read the terms and conditions and accept. At this point, click Generate.

3\. The Unlockitfree Generator will show you a series of 7 different unlocking codes. Not all of these will work; usually the best options are the 1st and 7th code on the list.

4\. Without removing your SIM card, input these codes into your phone’s Home screen.

Hopefully you will have success – although, this is not guaranteed (as it is with the first Dr.Fone option above).
