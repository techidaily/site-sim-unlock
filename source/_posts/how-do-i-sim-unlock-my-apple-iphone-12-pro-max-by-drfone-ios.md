## How Do I SIM Unlock My Apple iPhone 12 Pro Max?

If your Apple iPhone 12 Pro Max is locked to a particular carrier, it can be very frustrating. This is because your device will only be able to work with a SIM card from that provider and no other. This can be a problem when you want to change carriers. Some iPhones are generally easier to unlock than others, and the easiest way to unlock any iPhone is usually to use a paid online service. The issue is that these services can be very expensive.

In this article, we are going to look at how you can [sim unlock](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/unlock-android-screen/) your Apple iPhone 12 Pro Max. It is however important to note that if you purchased your device in the last one year, it is already unlocked.

Many people may wonder whether it is legal to unlock the iPhone. Actually, it is perfectly legal to unlock your Apple iPhone 12 Pro Max if you have completed payments on the contract, or you bought the Apple iPhone 12 Pro Max device outright. If however, you are still in the process of paying for your contract, you don't fully own the phone and so you should contact the carrier before unlocking it.

But if your Apple iPhone 12 Pro Max has [bad ESN](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/iphone-unlock/) or been blacklisted by the carrier, you can check the new post here to check what to do if you have a [blacklisted iPhone](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/iphone-unlock/).

##  Part 1: How to SIM Unlock Your Apple iPhone 12 Pro Max?

There are several ways to unlock your device. Let's look at a few of them.

### 1\. Contact your Carrier and Have them unlock the Apple iPhone 12 Pro Max device for you

This is probably the safest way to do it. If you have already completed payments on your Apple iPhone 12 Pro Max or you bought it outright, you can ask your carrier for the [sim network unlock pin](https://drfone.wondershare.com/unlock/unlock-samsung-sim-network-unlock-pin.html) to unlock your device. Depending on your carrier, you may have to pay for this service, and it also does take up to 7 days, sometimes more for them to get back to you.

### 2\. Software Unlocking

This is where you download a piece of [sim network unlock pin software](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/unlock-android-screen/) on to your device. This software makes changes to the Apple iPhone 12 Pro Max device, allowing you to make calls from any carrier. While this may sound straight-forward and easy, except it is highly risky and will not work for iPhone 4 and later models.

### 3\. Hardware Unlocking

This is where you alter the hardware of the Apple iPhone 12 Pro Max device to create an alternate path to deliver calls. Although this can be done, it also alters your device irreparably and probably also voids your warranty. Not to mention, you may pay more than $200 to have the Apple iPhone 12 Pro Max device unlocked in this way.

### 4\. IMEI unlocking

This is the best way to unlock your device and by far the easiest. This method uses your device's IMEI number to access the IMEI database and change the status of the Apple iPhone 12 Pro Max from locked to unlocked. There are very many services that you can use to IMEI unlock your device, and most of them will offer the service for a fee. But this is a great solution because there is no software to download, and you don't mess with the hardware in any way.

### Steps on How to Unlock Your Apple iPhone 12 Pro Max via IMEI

Like we mentioned before, there are a lot of services you can use to unlock your Apple iPhone 12 Pro Max. One of the best is [iPhoneIMEI.net](https://appleiphoneunlock.uk/network/Special%20Services/Activation%20Lock?aff=wondershare).

## 4 Best Methods to Unlock Apple iPhone 12 Pro Max

Following are three methods to unlock Apple iPhone 12 Pro Max

### Method 1: Contact your carrier for unlock code

When a customer signs a contract with a big cell phone company for a certain amount of time, they often get a discount on a device. Because of this, the Apple iPhone 12 Pro Max device comes with a controller lock so customers can only use it on their network.

You can leave without paying anything if your agreement with the company is over. You must meet the following requirements before you can unlock your Apple iPhone 12 Pro Max:

![sim unlock pin](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/12/how-to-unlock-iphone-11-12-4.jpg)

- First, the Apple iPhone 12 Pro Max device must be legal. It means the Apple iPhone 12 Pro Max device has not been reported as lost, stolen, or connected to a crime.
- Then you shouldn't have any debts in your bank account.
- If you signed a contract in exchange for a lower price upfront, you would have to wait until your contract ended (usually 24 months) or pay the remaining balance if you bought your phone on a payment plan.

Note: the unlocking process is different for each company.

**How to unlock the Apple iPhone 12 Pro Max locked by AT&T**

First, you need to know that AT&T limits how many devices a customer can unlock in a given year. Customers can unlock up to five devices per year if their account is in great condition.

- The device had used the T-Mobile network for at least 40 days before it was asked to be unlocked.

- The phone must have at least $50 worth of recharges paid for on prepaid plans.
- If you meet the above prerequisites, you can unlock an Apple iPhone 12 Pro Max carrier locked by a T-Mobile device by calling customer service at 611 from the Apple iPhone 12 Pro Max device you want to unlock.
- Make sure you have ALL of the following information on tips when you call:

1. The main account holder's phone number

**AppleiPhoneUnlock**

This website says that it can help you unlock your Apple iPhone 12 Pro Max or iPad. Please prepare your IMEI code and confirm the Apple iPhone 12 Pro Max device model.
