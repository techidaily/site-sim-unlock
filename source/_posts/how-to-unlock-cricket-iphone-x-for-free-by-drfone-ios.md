Navigate to Settings > General > About.

![carrier lock](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/12/unlock-iphone-online-7.jpg)

Apple has added a new Network Provider Lock section to iOS 14 that immediately tells you the Apple iPhone X device's status.

Scroll down to find the section called "Network Provider Lock." If the Apple iPhone X is unlocked, it should say "No SIM restrictions" on the screen. If you see something different, it means the Apple iPhone X is locked.

### Unlock iPhone SIM card via phone app

Call any number from the Phone app or contact to display the “SIM Locked” pop-up window and unlock your Apple iPhone X. The SIM PIN entry window will pop up again, ready for you to type in your code. Enter any fake number instead of dialing a real number like “333” and press the green button.

### Unlock your Apple iPhone X SIM card via "Settings"

The “Settings” app is another way to bring up the unlock notification. Go to the “Cellular” tab and choose “SIM PIN” as the last option. The SIM card should now ask you to unlock your Apple iPhone X.

### Unlock it via IMEI code

Contacting your carrier to unlock the sim lock on your Apple iPhone X is legit and straightway. But before contacting your carrier, you must fulfill the following conditions.

- The device must be legal, which means the Apple iPhone X device has not been reported as lost, stolen, or connected to a crime.
- You shouldn't have any debts in your bank account.
- If you signed a contract in exchange for a lower upfront price, you would have to wait until your contract expires (typically 24 months) or pay the remaining amount if you purchased your phone on a payment plan.

If you meet the above conditions, you can get the phone unlocked from your carrier. You have to provide them IMEI number of your device. However, the rest of the unlocking process is different for each company.
