To use the Android SIM unlock code generator, you will need to download and install the software on your computer. Once installed, you will need to connect your Android phone to the computer using a USB cable. The software will then detect your phone and check if it is eligible for unlocking.

## Part 3. Benefits of Using Android SIM Unlock Code Generator

There are several benefits of using Android SIM unlock code generator. Some of these benefits are:

- **1\. Freedom to choose your carrier**

When your phone is carrier locked, you are limited to using only the carrier that the phone is locked to. This can be a problem if you travel frequently or want to switch to a different carrier. By unlocking your phone's SIM card, you will be able to use any carrier's SIM card, giving you the freedom to choose the carrier that best suits your needs.

- **2\. Cost savings**

By unlocking your phone's SIM card, you can save money on roaming charges when traveling. Instead of paying expensive roaming charges, you can simply purchase a local SIM card and use it in your unlocked phone. This can save you a lot of money in the long run.

- **3\. Resale value**

An unlocked phone has a higher resale value than a carrier-locked phone. This is because an unlocked phone can be used with any carrier's SIM card, making it more attractive to buyers.

- **4\. No need to buy a new phone**

If you want to switch to a different carrier, you may be tempted to buy a new phone that is compatible with that carrier. However, by unlocking your phone's SIM card, you can use your existing phone with any carrier's SIM card, saving you the cost of buying a new phone.

**Pros**

- Software is very easy to install.
- User-friendly interface with easy-to-find menus and buttons.
- Supports many other phone brands, including Nokia, Sony, Samsung, and Siemens.
- Easy-to-follow simple instructions.
- Provide easily available basic information to get your unlocking code.

**Cons**

- Requires an internet connection to function (web-based tool).
- The name suggests the tool is useful only for Nokia mobiles.

**Review**

The NokiaFree Android SIM unlock code generator is getting better all the time. You now have access to a tool that is easy to use, and quickly unlocks restrictions on a wide range of mobiles, and anywhere in the world. An added bonus is it comes to you totally free of cost. The download takes very little time, and this Android unlock code generator does not interfere with other functions.

### Tool 2: WorldUnlock Codes Calculator

As the name suggests, the [WorldUnlock Codes Calculator](https://www.allmobitools.com/worldunlock-codes-calculator-latest/) can unlock your phone in any location with just a few clicks. It's easy to find a reliable code generator, but you'd have to pay for receiving a code in variable amounts. In other words, there are no fixed charges to locate your phone unlock code from a dealer. However, this software is totally free and requires only basic details to provide the unlock code.

![worldunlock](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/05/worldunlock-codes-calculator.jpg)

#### How It Works

Just locate the IMEI number by typing in \*#06# into your phone. Enter the code into the software along with basic details like country of purchase and service provider. That's it.

**Review**
