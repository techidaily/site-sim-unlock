### Unlock it via IMEI code

Contacting your carrier to unlock the sim lock on your Apple iPhone 13 Pro is legit and straightway. But before contacting your carrier, you must fulfill the following conditions.

- The device must be legal, which means the Apple iPhone 13 Pro device has not been reported as lost, stolen, or connected to a crime.
- You shouldn't have any debts in your bank account.
- If you signed a contract in exchange for a lower upfront price, you would have to wait until your contract expires (typically 24 months) or pay the remaining amount if you purchased your phone on a payment plan.

If you meet the above conditions, you can get the phone unlocked from your carrier. You have to provide them IMEI number of your device. However, the rest of the unlocking process is different for each company.

## How To Factory Unlock Your Telstra Apple iPhone 13 Pro

For many Australians, Telstra offers a convenient and reliable way to experience the iPhone’s innovative features. However, like most network providers, Telstra iPhones come locked, restricting their use of Telstra’s network. This might not be ideal for everyone, especially if you travel internationally, seek more competitive plans, or prefer the flexibility of switching carriers.

The good news is that unlocking your Telstra iPhone is straightforward, granting you the freedom to choose the network that best suits your needs. This guide will give you what you need to **unlock Telstra iPhones** and other phones. It will let you unlock your Apple iPhone 13 Pro’s full potential and navigate the exciting world of mobile network options.

## Method 1: How To Unlock Apple iPhone 13 Pro With Telstra’s Official Methods

For peace of mind and guaranteed success, unlocking your Telstra iPhone through Telstra’s official methods is the ideal choice. This straightforward approach ensures a smooth transition and adheres to carrier policies, eliminating potential complications. There are two main options offered to **unlock Telstra phones.**

### Option 1: Freedom After Two Years

If you’ve been loyal to Telstra and maintained a phone plan for 24 months or more, congratulations! You’re entitled to **unlock your Telstra phone for free**. This allows you to explore other networks without any additional cost. Contact Telstra through their app or phone; their friendly representatives will guide you through the process.

### Option 2: Pay as You Go

Haven’t quite reached the two-year mark yet? Don’t worry! Telstra offers a paid unlocking option based on how long you’ve been with them:

- **Under 6 months:**$80 unlock fee
- **6 months to 2 years:**$25 unlock fee

Remember that these fees are subject to change, so it’s always best to double-check with Telstra’s website or customer service for the latest information.

- **Step 1:** Find your IMEI number. This unique 17-digit code identifies your phone. Dial \*#06# on your Apple iPhone 13 Pro, or locate it on the back of the phone (if applicable) or the original box.
- **Step 2:** Use the My Telstra app under the “Get Help” section, call 125 8887 from a Telstra phone, 13 22 00 from a non-Telstra phone, or +61 439 125 888 if you’re overseas.
- **Step 3:** A Telstra representative will guide you through the process, explain any applicable fees, and assist you with payment if you are still within the 2-year period.

![dr.fone sim lock removal success](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/remove-iphone-sim-7.png)

**Disclaimer:** It’s vital to note that unlocking methods, particularly with third-party tools, may not always be successful, especially for newer iPhone models and iOS versions. Also, using third-party unlocking tools can void your phone’s warranty, leaving you responsible for any future repairs not covered by the manufacturer.

## Method 3: Using Online Unlockers To Unlock Telstra iPhones

While venturing into the online realm, you might encounter websites offering remote unlocking services for a fee. These services claim to **unlock your Telstra phone** quickly and conveniently, often without contacting the carrier. However, approaching this method requires extreme caution due to potential risks and legal implications.

Before diving in:

- **Understand the risks.**Online unlocking services operate in a gray area, potentially violating your carrier’s terms and conditions. This could lead to legal trouble or void your phone’s warranty.
- **Beware of scams.**Unfortunately, not all online unlocking services are legitimate. Many are scams designed to steal your money or personal information.
- **Do your research.**If you choose to proceed, thoroughly research the service provider. Read reviews from other users, check their track record, and ensure they have a good reputation.

These services typically require you to provide your phone’s IMEI number and pay a fee. They then claim to use various methods, often software or network vulnerabilities, to unlock your phone remotely. However, the success rate and security of these methods are highly questionable. Thus, relying on Dr.Fone as an alternative unlocking method is recommended.

## Conclusion

**Unlocking Telstra iPhones** gives you network flexibility, but navigating the process requires a measured approach. Remember, while Telstra’s official methods offer a guaranteed and secure path to freedom, third-party tools like Wondershare Dr.Fone present a potential avenue for those seeking alternative solutions.

After all, Wondershare Dr.Fone remains a valuable tool for your broader phone needs. From data recovery to system repair, its diverse functionalities can enhance your mobile experience in various ways. You can use it as an all-in-one application for all your needs, from network unlocking to system repair.
