## All About Apple iPhone XR Unlock Chip You Need to Know

Have you purchased an iPhone from a cellular company or through a contract? So, it's clear that you aren't free to use your Apple iPhone XR. The most common barrier is that you can't use a SIM card from another network. The good news is that you can set up your Apple iPhone XR to connect to any network you want in several ways.

In this article, we'll talk about the Apple iPhone XR unlock chip and special software that can remove SIM restrictions from your Apple iPhone XR. After reading this article, I hope your Apple iPhone XR's network settings will continue you from doing what you want.

## What is iPhone Unlock Chip?

iPhone unlock chip is a microchip that unlocks the iPhones and makes them able to run on any network worldwide. When you buy an iPhone, it is either locked (unable to accept carrier) or factory unlocked (can accept any carrier). These unlock chips can bypass the carrier locks in iPhones and enable locked devices to work with any SIM.

An unlock chip is an easy and cheap way to get an Apple iPhone XR to work with a different SIM card Using iPhone unlock chip enables the locked Apple iPhone XR to call and send SMS using the local network sim card, just like a factory-unlocked phone does. There have been different unlocking chips available with different names and brands, but they all do the same thing.

### How does it work

An unlock chip is typically a slim SIM card, a memory interface chip that can be put in along with your regular SIM card. It goes on top of your Apple iPhone XR's normal SIM card and removes the network lock so you can use any sim.

![iphone unlock chip](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/12/iphone-unlock-chip-4.jpg)

The factory lock is removed quickly when an unlock chip is put into your Apple iPhone XR. An iPhone Unlock Chip fools your Apple iPhone XR into thinking it only uses a Cricket SIM card. The Apple iPhone XR Unlock Chip has the structure to fake the iPhone's IMEI number and the authentication key, which allows it to work with any GSM Service.

Putting an iPhone Unlock Chip around your regular SIM card changes how your Apple iPhone XR and SIM card talk to each other. So, the unlock chip's controller fakes the IMSI number, which allows you to use other mobile networks.

Unfortunately, many iPhone unlock chips require a jailbroken iPhone before being used. Even if your Apple iPhone XR isn't jailbroken, you can still use an iPhone unlock chip to access some of its features.

There are several places to find information about jailbreaking an iPhone. After selecting, you can program your Apple iPhone XR's unlock chip by following the on-screen instructions.

Both the options mentioned above offer a legitimate means by which you can AT&T unlock your Apple iPhone XR, whether done without a SIM card or by contacting the AT&T carrier.

However, going by personal experience the DoctorSIM alternative offers a much smoother, efficient and quicker alternative to contacting the AT&T carriers. It is also more secure because if you are going via the carrier without a SIM card then you'll need to back up your Apple iPhone XR, then delete and restore it as well (for security measures). This isn't just a time consuming process, but it can also prove to be risky. Furthermore, AT&T has a lot of checks and requisites in place which can keep your Apple iPhone XR from being unlocked, and even if you do pass the requisites it's still a time-consuming process which may still be rejected as AT&T has final say. As such, going via DoctorSIM gives you complete agency and conveniently AT&T unlocks iPhone without any data loss, through a simple 3 step process.
