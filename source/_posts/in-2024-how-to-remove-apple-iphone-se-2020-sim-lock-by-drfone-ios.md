When you buy an iPhone, it is either locked (unable to accept carrier) or factory unlocked (can accept any carrier). These unlock chips can bypass the carrier locks in iPhones and enable locked devices to work with any SIM.

An unlock chip is an easy and cheap way to get an Apple iPhone SE (2020) to work with a different SIM card Using iPhone unlock chip enables the locked Apple iPhone SE (2020) to call and send SMS using the local network sim card, just like a factory-unlocked phone does.

Unfortunately, many iPhone unlock chips require a jailbroken iPhone before being used. Even if your Apple iPhone SE (2020) isn't jailbroken, you can still use an iPhone unlock chip to access some of its features.
