**_Ask your Carrier to Unlock your Device_**

This is the best option when you want to safely unlock your device. By February 2015, American cell phone owners got the option to request their carriers to unlock their device for them. Before that the law didn't allow for carriers to unlock SIM cards in the United States. This unpopular law was reversed following a similar move by the European Union in 2013.

## Part 5: The benefits of an unlocked Itel S23+

If you now know how to unlock Itel S23+ but still do not know its advantages, we are here to help.

As indicated in the introduction, unlocked phone users can freely choose the plans they subscribed to---on any carriers, in any country. Therefore, if you travel frequently around the world, having an unlocked Itel S23+ would be beneficial. Using a local SIM card is much cheaper than paying for exorbitant roaming charges.

You can also benefit from an unlocked Itel S23+ if you are the kind of person who likes to take advantage of current offers provided by your local carriers. Prepaid plans are always changing in terms of offering so having the flexibility of changing carriers and prepaid plans can help you save money in the long run.

## Part 6: The downside of an unlocked Itel S23+

Are you thinking "Well, why can't I just buy an unlocked Itel S23+ in the first place?" right about now? Well, you can but think of the amount of money it will cost you.

For example, in Australia, an unlocked Itel S23+ will cost around $499 from any Itel outlet but $0 for the Itel S23+ device when you pair it with a 24-month postpaid plan. While this may look attractive now, you may be paying more for a locked Itel S23+ in the long run.

## Conclusion

Now that you know the three ways of unlocking your Itel S23+, all you need to do is find one that is most compatible with you. Just remember to think of everything through and carefully. Most importantly, if you have a locked device, always seek advice from your carrier to see if this is possible.
