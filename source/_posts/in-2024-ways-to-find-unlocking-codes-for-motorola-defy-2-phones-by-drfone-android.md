## Ways To Find Unlocking Codes For Motorola Defy 2 Phones

When you have a locked device, it is pretty much impossible to move from one network to another. This would cause problems if for instance you wanted to travel outside the country and want to switch to that country's carrier for the duration of your stay. Or maybe you just want to switch carriers because you don't like your current provider.

Whatever the reason, you should be able to unlock your device easily. But this has often proven difficult because of the fact that you need unlock codes. The problem is that many sites promise free unlocking codes for your device and many turn out to be fraudulent sites that use the word "free" in their advertising but actually require you to pay for the service. If you have been unsuccessfully searching for free unlocking codes for your device, look no further. This article compiles three of the best for Android and iPhone.

Website URL: [https://www.unlockbase.com/wholesale-phone-unlocking](https://www.unlockbase.com/wholesale-phone-unlocking)

This service will unlock almost all devices, both Android and iPhone. It is also very fast and reliable. But perhaps the best feature of this service is that you can be aware of just how much you will have to spend to unlock your device long before you place the order.

To use the service, simply go to the main home page and check on the table provided how long it will take for your device to be unlocked and how much you have to pay. If you are happy with both estimates. Choose to unlock from the main menu and then proceed to select your device.

Once you have selected the Motorola Defy 2 device, enter the IMEI code, your email address, your country, and the network you are on. Then click on "Proceed to check out". Make payment and then wait for the assigned time for the [sim network unlock pin](https://drfone.wondershare.com/unlock/unlock-samsung-sim-network-unlock-pin.html) to be sent to the email address you provided.

Doctorsim will permanently unlock your phone, enabling you to use your phone on all carriers around the world. Most importantly, using DoctorSim will not void your warranty.

## Part 2: Unlockitfree.com for free Motorola unlock codes

Unlockitfree.com is a free remote unlock service, providing unlocking codes for Motorola Defy 2 phones and other models. They offer a fast and free service, but it is not always reliable.

### How to use the Unlockitfree.com Unlock Service?

1\. First, enter your phone’s unique IMEI into the site, and then the site checks to ensure that it is genuine.

2\. Choose your phone model from the list provided, and then choose your country. Once you choose your country, a list of supported Service Providers will pop up. Choose your service provider, read the terms and conditions and accept. At this point, click Generate.

3\. The Unlockitfree Generator will show you a series of 7 different unlocking codes. Not all of these will work; usually the best options are the 1st and 7th code on the list.

4\. Without removing your SIM card, input these codes into your phone’s Home screen.

Hopefully you will have success – although, this is not guaranteed (as it is with the first Dr.Fone option above).
