## The Best Android SIM Unlock Code Generators: Unlock Your Xiaomi Redmi 13C Phone Hassle-Free

In today's world, smartphones have become an essential part of our lives. They offer a lot of convenience, but sometimes they can be a bit of a hassle. One of the biggest headaches that smartphone users face is carrier locking. This is when your phone is locked to a specific carrier, and you are unable to use it with any other carrier's SIM card.

If you've tried Googling for solutions, you'll realize it may take a long time to find a reliable solution. In effect, what you're looking for is an Android [SIM unlock](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/unlock-android-screen/) code generator to provide you with a free unlock code. Some free solutions may have hidden costs, so you must be careful in choosing the right Android [sim network to unlock pin software](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/unlock-android-screen/). Here are seven free Android unlock code generators to consider.

## Part 1. What is Android SIM Unlock Code Generator?

Android SIM unlock code generator is a software or application that generates unlock codes for Android phones. These codes are used to unlock the phone's SIM card, enabling the phone to work with any carrier's SIM card. The software is designed to be user-friendly and easy to use, with step-by-step instructions to guide you through the process.

## Part 2. How Does Android SIM Unlock Code Generator Work?

To use the Android SIM unlock code generator, you will need to download and install the software on your computer. Once installed, you will need to connect your Android phone to the computer using a USB cable. The software will then detect your phone and check if it is eligible for unlocking.

If your phone is eligible for unlocking, the software will generate an unlock code. You will then need to enter this code into your phone's keypad to unlock the SIM card. Once the SIM card is unlocked, you will be able to use your phone with any carrier's SIM card.

## Part 3. Benefits of Using Android SIM Unlock Code Generator

There are several benefits of using Android SIM unlock code generator. Some of these benefits are:

- **1\. Freedom to choose your carrier**

When your phone is carrier locked, you are limited to using only the carrier that the phone is locked to. This can be a problem if you travel frequently or want to switch to a different carrier. By unlocking your phone's SIM card, you will be able to use any carrier's SIM card, giving you the freedom to choose the carrier that best suits your needs.

- **2\. Cost savings**

By unlocking your phone's SIM card, you can save money on roaming charges when traveling. Instead of paying expensive roaming charges, you can simply purchase a local SIM card and use it in your unlocked phone. This can save you a lot of money in the long run.

- **3\. Resale value**

An unlocked phone has a higher resale value than a carrier-locked phone. This is because an unlocked phone can be used with any carrier's SIM card, making it more attractive to buyers.

- **4\. No need to buy a new phone**

If you want to switch to a different carrier, you may be tempted to buy a new phone that is compatible with that carrier. However, by unlocking your phone's SIM card, you can use your existing phone with any carrier's SIM card, saving you the cost of buying a new phone.

<iframe width="100%" height="450" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/__hZHsdFMvI" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe>

Next, follow the instructions, and you will be able to use any carriers soon. Dr.Fone will  “Remove Setting” for your device at last to enable Wi-Fi connecting. Visit the [iPhone SIM Unlock guide](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/iphone-unlock/) to get more!

### 2\. Unlock Base

Website URL: [https://www.unlockbase.com/wholesale-phone-unlocking](https://www.unlockbase.com/wholesale-phone-unlocking)

This service will unlock almost all devices, both Android and iPhone. It is also very fast and reliable. But perhaps the best feature of this service is that you can be aware of just how much you will have to spend to unlock your device long before you place the order.

To use the service, simply go to the main home page and check on the table provided how long it will take for your device to be unlocked and how much you have to pay. If you are happy with both estimates. Choose to unlock from the main menu and then proceed to select your device.

Once you have selected the Xiaomi Redmi 13C device, enter the IMEI code, your email address, your country, and the network you are on. Then click on "Proceed to check out". Make payment and then wait for the assigned time for the [sim network unlock pin](https://drfone.wondershare.com/unlock/unlock-samsung-sim-network-unlock-pin.html) to be sent to the email address you provided.

### 3\. iPhone IMEI

Website URL: [https://iphoneimei.net/](https://appleiphoneunlock.uk/network/Special%20Services/Activation%20Lock?aff=wondershare)

This one is perhaps the easiest to use. It offers two services, one to check your iPhone's IMEI and the other to use the IMEI number to unlock the iPhone.

To use the service, select the “Unlock iPhone” on the homepage. Then select the model and the network the iPhone is locked to. Click “Unlock” to

continue.  You will be sent to a checkout page where you can pay the amount. The codes will be sent to the email address you provided at checkout.

### 4\. Doctor SIM

This is another website that can easily unlock just about any device model. It also offers an IMEI checker service as well as a lot of other helpful information about phone unlocking IMEI numbers and other issues related to devising unlocking.

To use it, click on "Unlock your Phone" in the main menu and select your device from the drop-down menu. You should see the amount you have to pay to unlock the Xiaomi Redmi 13C device. Click on "Unlock your phone now" to continue.

In the next window, select your country and network provider and enter the phone's IMEI number and other information. Choose a payment method and then continue to check out. You will receive the codes at the email address you provided.

### 5\. Mobile Unlocked

Website URL: [https://www.mobileunlocked.com/](https://www.mobileunlocked.com/)

This is another service that will also provide you with phone unlock codes at a price. Just like the others, we have seen it is very easy to use and supports all devices.

To use it, select the “Unlock” option from the main menu and then choose your device's model from the drop-down menu.  Next, provide your device's details and then proceed to pay for the service and provide your name, email address, and IMEI number.

Once you click on “unlock now” all you have to do is wait the stipulated time for the codes to be sent to you.

![SIM unlock service](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2016/06/14670574555007.jpg)

### 6\. Cell Unlocker

Website URL: [http://www.cellunlocker.net/](http://www.cellunlocker.net/)

This service will also offer to unlock services at a price. The service unlocks all devices, including the iPhone, and they pride themselves on providing excellent service in the shortest period.  They also offer a 100% guarantee that they offer this service at the lowest price in the market.

To use this service, select "Unlock your Device" from the main menu and then select your device model from the list provided. There is a lot of information to read through, but when you scroll down a bit, you should be able to enter the Xiaomi Redmi 13C device's information and then click on "look for code"

You will be directed to a payment page where you can make your payment.  The codes will be sent to you in a few days.
