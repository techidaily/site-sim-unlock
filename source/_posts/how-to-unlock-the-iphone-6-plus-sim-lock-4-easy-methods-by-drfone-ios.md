### How to unlock the Apple iPhone 6 Plus locked by Verizon

To prevent theft and other types of fraud, Verizon locks new devices to only work on the Verizon network. The company has different rules for unlocking prepaid and post-pay devices, as well as special rules for people in the military who are distributed.

If you buy a phone from Verizon, it will be locked for 60 days after you buy it. If you buy a device from one of their authorized retailers, it will be locked for 60 days after it is activated.

After 60 days, the lock will be taken off itself unless the Apple iPhone 6 Plus device is found to be stolen or was bought through fraud. After 60 days, their phones are never locked again.

After activation, devices you buy from Verizon and some devices you buy from one of their authorized retailers are locked for 60 days. After 60 days, the lock will be taken off itself unless the Apple iPhone 6 Plus device is found to be stolen or was bought through fraud. After the first 60 days, their phones are locked, but after that, they never lock them again.

**Military Personnel Placement Unlocking Policy**

If you are in the military and a Verizon Wireless customer, in case, you get orders to move outside of the Verizon Coverage Area. The company will unlock your device and stop your service if you ask, even if it has only been 60 days since you bought it.

### Contact your carrier to unlock it with the IMEI code

When a customer deals an agreement with a large cell phone company for a certain amount of time, they usually get a discount on a device. Because of this, the Apple iPhone 6 Plus device has a controller lock, so customers can only use it on their network. You can leave without paying anything if your contract with the company is over. Before you can unlock your Apple iPhone 6 Plus, you have to do the following:

First, it has to be legal. It means the Apple iPhone 6 Plus device has not been reported as lost, stolen, or linked to a crime.

Then your bank account shouldn't have any debts. If you signed a contract in exchange for a lower price upfront, you would have to wait until your contract was up (usually 24 months) or pay the remaining balance if you bought your phone on a payment plan. Each company has its way of unlocking.

It is the most straightforward approach, but it comes with some restrictions. You must meet Cricket’s unlock policy requirements. If you fulfill these conditions, you can request a **Cricket unlock code for free** online.

Early Unlocking for Military Personnel

Good news if you’re in the military. You can ask their customer support to unlock your Apple iPhone 6 Plus, even if you haven’t used the service for six months. Having a **Cricket device unlocked** earlier is a way to help you stay connected during deployments.

Third-Party iPhone Unlocking Tools

Not all devices can be unlocked by Cricket if you don’t qualify for their requirements. However, paid online services and third-party apps can open up your options. These tools can help you use your phone on any compatible carrier, even if you don’t meet **Cricket device unlock** requirements.

While this option can be faster, choosing a reputable service provider and understanding the associated risks is crucial. Ensure it is legal in your region and won’t harm your phone’s functionality.

Ready to **unlock Cricket iPhone**? But wait, are you sure you meet the eligibility criteria? Let’s find out in the next section.
