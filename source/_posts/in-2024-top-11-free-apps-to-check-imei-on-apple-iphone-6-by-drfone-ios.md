## Part 3: How to unlock T Mobile iPhone via T Mobile carrier

If you want to unlock, say for example, a T Mobile iPhone 5s without a third-party tool, but by contacting the carrier directly, you can do that as well though that process would have a lot more restrictions and take a lot longer. Requesting carriers to T Mobile unlock iPhone 5s is becoming more and more of an outdated concept in the face of far easier third-party softwares. However, contacting the carriers directly is also a legitimate means. So read on to find out how to unlock T Mobile iPhone 5s via T Mobile carrier.

### How to unlock T Mobile iPhone 5s via T Mobile carrier

#### **Step 1:** Eligibility

When you try to unlock T Mobile iPhone 5s directly through the carrier you are faced with a lot of restrictions and verification processes. Hence, to keep yourself from wasting your own time, you should go and read their page on eligibility to make sure you pass the test. Follow this link: support.t-mobile.com/docs/DOC-1588.

#### **Step 2:** Contact

Next you simply need to go to their Customer Care page and file a request for the unlock code. Follow the following link to contact them: <https://support.t-mobile.com/community/contact-us>. However you should bear in mind that they can reject any application at all.

Finally, all you have to do is enter the unlock code to your keypad and voila! You now have a T Mobile unlock iPhone 5s.

## Part 4: How to check if my iPhone is unlocked or not

Before you take some drastic and time consuming measures it might be helpful to confirm whether you already have an unlocked phone.

You can back up easily with iCloud. It is a very simple solution. Simply go to settings on your Apple iPhone 6, followed by 'iCloud', then tap 'Back up now.'

Finally, just restore all the information from the iCloud back up. This is also fairly simple. As you follow the system setup after erasing, you'll be taken to the 'Apps & Data' screen. Simply select 'Restore from iCloud Backup.'

![unlock t mobile iphone-restore iphone](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14772497801720.jpg)

With that your Apple iPhone 6 is now completely unlock activated! You're free to use it as you please now.

In this article we've explained how to unlock T Mobile Apple iPhone 6 using DoctorSIM - SIM Unlock Service, and how to unlock T Mobile iPhone 5s using the T Mobile carrier itself. While both of them are perfectly legitimate means of unlocking your Apple iPhone 6s, I personally lean more towards the DoctorSIM solution as they don't have any pesky eligibility criteria, nor do they make you wait long. They are a 100% solution, especially considering they're a third-party tool which makes them less biased as they don't have an incentive to keep you from unlocking. Well, we hope this helped and hopefully now you have a T Mobile unlock iPhone!

### Method 1: Contact your carrier for unlock code

When a customer signs a contract with a big cell phone company for a certain amount of time, they often get a discount on a device. Because of this, the Apple iPhone 6 device comes with a controller lock so customers can only use it on their network.

You can leave without paying anything if your agreement with the company is over. You must meet the following requirements before you can unlock your Apple iPhone 6:

![sim unlock pin](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/12/how-to-unlock-iphone-11-12-4.jpg)

- First, the Apple iPhone 6 device must be legal. It means the Apple iPhone 6 device has not been reported as lost, stolen, or connected to a crime.
- Then you shouldn't have any debts in your bank account.
- If you signed a contract in exchange for a lower price upfront, you would have to wait until your contract ended (usually 24 months) or pay the remaining balance if you bought your phone on a payment plan.

Note: the unlocking process is different for each company.

**How to unlock the Apple iPhone 6 locked by AT&T**

First, you need to know that AT&T limits how many devices a customer can unlock in a given year. Customers can unlock up to five devices per year if their account is in great condition. Visit the AT&T support page for more information about how to unlock an AT&T device and if you meet the requirements.

**AT&T Unlocking security question**

- The full name of the person whose name is on the account
- Last four digits of the account holder's social security number
- AT&T passcode of the registered account owner if they have an online account.
- The IMEI number of the Apple iPhone 6 is 11/12. The serial number of the Apple iPhone 6 device is called the IMEI number. You can find it on the original packaging, under the battery, and on the back of some models, by dialing #06 or navigating to Settings > General > About.

**How to unlock the Apple iPhone 6 locked by T-Mobile**

T-Mobile has set several standards that should be matched to complete an unlock request.

- The device must be completely paid off, and the account must be in great condition.
- In the past 12 months, less than two SIM unlock codes for each line have been asked for.
- The device had used the T-Mobile network for at least 40 days before it was asked to be unlocked.
- If you have a service contract and have made a payment for at least 18 consecutive months, or if you paid a relocation fee. There are a few special cases that Customer Service can explain in more detail if required.
- The phone must have at least $50 worth of recharges paid for on prepaid plans.
- If you meet the above prerequisites, you can unlock an Apple iPhone 6 carrier locked by a T-Mobile device by calling customer service at 611 from the Apple iPhone 6 device you want to unlock.
- Make sure you have ALL of the following information on tips when you call:

1. The main account holder's phone number
2. Account Password
3. Account holder's SSN's last four digits
4. IMEI number. You can find this by navigating Settings > General > About or dialing \*#06#.

### Method 3: Try a SIM-unlock chip

iPhone unlock chips allow iPhones to run on any network globally. Unlocking an iPhone with this option is a cheap and very easy way. The Apple iPhone 6 unlock chip allows a locked Apple iPhone 6 to call and text using the local network sim card like a factory-unlocked phone. Unlock chip is a small SIM card that can be used along with regular SIM cards.

However, these Sim-unlock chips have some drawbacks. It reduces the Battery life and may cause SIM card slot and SIM card issues.
