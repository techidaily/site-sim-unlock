If the phone accepts the new SIM and allows calls and data usage, congratulations, your phone is unlocked! Conversely, if the phone displays an error message like “SIM Not Supported” or “Invalid SIM,” it’s likely locked to your current carrier.

### How To Check if Your iPhone Is Unlocked

For iPhone users, navigating the unlock status involves a quick trip to your device settings:

- **Step 1:**Open your iPhone’s Settings app.
- **Step 2:** Navigate to **General** in Settings, then tap **About**.
- **Step 3:** Scroll down and check for **Carrier Lock** or **Service Provider Lock**. If it says **No SIM Restrictions**, your phone is unlocked. It’s easy to learn **how to tell if a phone is unlocked** when using an iPhone.
