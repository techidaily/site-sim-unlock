## Three Ways to Sim Unlock Oppo A2

You probably purchased your Oppo A2 for a significant discount but are now stuck with the same network for a couple of years. You loved the Oppo A2 device but your network provider does not have any plans that exactly suit your needs. To release your device from your current network's clutches, you will need to unlock your phone.

There are three ways you can do it and this post will go through each method so that you can find one that you are most comfortable with. Do note that if your contract has ended with your network provider, this "How to unlock Oppo A2" post can be skipped as you can just ask them to unlock your phone or purchase a [sim network unlock pin](https://drfone.wondershare.com/unlock/unlock-samsung-sim-network-unlock-pin.html) for a minimal price.

## Part 1: Oppo A2 Unlock Code

This is probably the easiest, no-fuss method to [sim unlock](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/unlock-android-screen/) Oppo A2. Follow these steps carefully to successfully perform Oppo A2 unlock code.

Do take note that this process may not work with your carrier. Therefore, always check if this is the right way to obtain the necessary code:

- 1\. Check the SIM lock status---you can do this by dialing **\*#\*#7378423#\*#\***.

![sony xperia unlock code](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2016/08/14707989592943.jpg)

1. Get a new SIM card from a new carrier.
2. Call your carrier's customer service line and ask what are the requirements to qualify you to get your Oppo A2 unlocked. If you have honored your contract, there should not be any problems. However, do ask your carrier if there are any additional requirements. Do note that there may be fees involved.

## Part 5: The benefits of an unlocked Oppo A2

If you now know how to unlock Oppo A2 but still do not know its advantages, we are here to help.

As indicated in the introduction, unlocked phone users can freely choose the plans they subscribed to---on any carriers, in any country. Therefore, if you travel frequently around the world, having an unlocked Oppo A2 would be beneficial. Using a local SIM card is much cheaper than paying for exorbitant roaming charges.

You can also benefit from an unlocked Oppo A2 if you are the kind of person who likes to take advantage of current offers provided by your local carriers. Prepaid plans are always changing in terms of offering so having the flexibility of changing carriers and prepaid plans can help you save money in the long run.

## Part 6: The downside of an unlocked Oppo A2

Are you thinking "Well, why can't I just buy an unlocked Oppo A2 in the first place?" right about now? Well, you can but think of the amount of money it will cost you.

For example, in Australia, an unlocked Oppo A2 will cost around $499 from any Oppo outlet but $0 for the Oppo A2 device when you pair it with a 24-month postpaid plan. While this may look attractive now, you may be paying more for a locked Oppo A2 in the long run.

## Conclusion

Now that you know the three ways of unlocking your Oppo A2, all you need to do is find one that is most compatible with you. Just remember to think of everything through and carefully. Most importantly, if you have a locked device, always seek advice from your carrier to see if this is possible.

## The Best Android SIM Unlock Code Generators: Unlock Your Oppo A2 Phone Hassle-Free

In today's world, smartphones have become an essential part of our lives. They offer a lot of convenience, but sometimes they can be a bit of a hassle. One of the biggest headaches that smartphone users face is carrier locking. This is when your phone is locked to a specific carrier, and you are unable to use it with any other carrier's SIM card.

If you've tried Googling for solutions, you'll realize it may take a long time to find a reliable solution. In effect, what you're looking for is an Android [SIM unlock](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/unlock-android-screen/) code generator to provide you with a free unlock code. Some free solutions may have hidden costs, so you must be careful in choosing the right Android [sim network to unlock pin software](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/unlock-android-screen/). Here are seven free Android unlock code generators to consider.

## Part 1. What is Android SIM Unlock Code Generator?

These codes are used to unlock the phone's SIM card, enabling the phone to work with any carrier's SIM card. The software is designed to be user-friendly and easy to use, with step-by-step instructions to guide you through the process.

## Part 2. How Does Android SIM Unlock Code Generator Work?

To use the Android SIM unlock code generator, you will need to download and install the software on your computer. Once installed, you will need to connect your Android phone to the computer using a USB cable. The software will then detect your phone and check if it is eligible for unlocking.

## Part 3. Benefits of Using Android SIM Unlock Code Generator

There are several benefits of using Android SIM unlock code generator. Some of these benefits are:

- **1\. Freedom to choose your carrier**

When your phone is carrier locked, you are limited to using only the carrier that the phone is locked to. This can be a problem if you travel frequently or want to switch to a different carrier. By unlocking your phone's SIM card, you will be able to use any carrier's SIM card, giving you the freedom to choose the carrier that best suits your needs.

- **2\. Cost savings**

An unlocked phone has a higher resale value than a carrier-locked phone. This is because an unlocked phone can be used with any carrier's SIM card, making it more attractive to buyers.

- **4\. No need to buy a new phone**

If you want to switch to a different carrier, you may be tempted to buy a new phone that is compatible with that carrier. However, by unlocking your phone's SIM card, you can use your existing phone with any carrier's SIM card, saving you the cost of buying a new phone.
