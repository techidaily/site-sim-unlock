## Three Ways to Sim Unlock Oppo Reno 8T

You probably purchased your Oppo Reno 8T for a significant discount but are now stuck with the same network for a couple of years. You loved the Oppo Reno 8T device but your network provider does not have any plans that exactly suit your needs. To release your device from your current network's clutches, you will need to unlock your phone.

There are three ways you can do it and this post will go through each method so that you can find one that you are most comfortable with. Do note that if your contract has ended with your network provider, this "How to unlock Oppo Reno 8T" post can be skipped as you can just ask them to unlock your phone or purchase a [sim network unlock pin](https://drfone.wondershare.com/unlock/unlock-samsung-sim-network-unlock-pin.html) for a minimal price.

## Part 1: Oppo Reno 8T Unlock Code

This is probably the easiest, no-fuss method to [sim unlock](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/unlock-android-screen/) Oppo Reno 8T. Follow these steps carefully to successfully perform Oppo Reno 8T unlock code.

If you now know how to unlock Oppo Reno 8T but still do not know its advantages, we are here to help.

As indicated in the introduction, unlocked phone users can freely choose the plans they subscribed to---on any carriers, in any country.

## Part 6: The downside of an unlocked Oppo Reno 8T

Are you thinking "Well, why can't I just buy an unlocked Oppo Reno 8T in the first place?" right about now? Well, you can but think of the amount of money it will cost you.
