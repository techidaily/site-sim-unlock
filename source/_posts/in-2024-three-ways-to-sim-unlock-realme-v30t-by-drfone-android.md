## Three Ways to Sim Unlock Realme V30T

You probably purchased your Realme V30T for a significant discount but are now stuck with the same network for a couple of years. You loved the Realme V30T device but your network provider does not have any plans that exactly suit your needs. To release your device from your current network's clutches, you will need to unlock your phone.

There are three ways you can do it and this post will go through each method so that you can find one that you are most comfortable with. Do note that if your contract has ended with your network provider, this "How to unlock Realme V30T" post can be skipped as you can just ask them to unlock your phone or purchase a [sim network unlock pin](https://drfone.wondershare.com/unlock/unlock-samsung-sim-network-unlock-pin.html) for a minimal price.

## Part 1: Realme V30T Unlock Code

This is probably the easiest, no-fuss method to [sim unlock](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/unlock-android-screen/) Realme V30T. Follow these steps carefully to successfully perform Realme V30T unlock code.

Again, depending on your carrier, they might either give you the code over the phone, through email or via SMS.

As indicated in the introduction, unlocked phone users can freely choose the plans they subscribed to---on any carriers, in any country. Therefore, if you travel frequently around the world, having an unlocked Realme V30T would be beneficial. Using a local SIM card is much cheaper than paying for exorbitant roaming charges.
