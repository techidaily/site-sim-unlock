## Three Ways to Sim Unlock Realme V30T

You probably purchased your Realme V30T for a significant discount but are now stuck with the same network for a couple of years. You loved the Realme V30T device but your network provider does not have any plans that exactly suit your needs. To release your device from your current network's clutches, you will need to unlock your phone.

There are three ways you can do it and this post will go through each method so that you can find one that you are most comfortable with. Do note that if your contract has ended with your network provider, this "How to unlock Realme V30T" post can be skipped as you can just ask them to unlock your phone or purchase a [sim network unlock pin](https://drfone.wondershare.com/unlock/unlock-samsung-sim-network-unlock-pin.html) for a minimal price.

## Part 1: Realme V30T Unlock Code

This is probably the easiest, no-fuss method to [sim unlock](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/unlock-android-screen/) Realme V30T. Follow these steps carefully to successfully perform Realme V30T unlock code.

1. Get a new SIM card from a new carrier.
2. Call your carrier's customer service line and ask what are the requirements to qualify you to get your Realme V30T unlocked. If you have honored your contract, there should not be any problems. However, do ask your carrier if there are any additional requirements. Do note that there may be fees involved.

Again, depending on your carrier, they might either give you the code over the phone, through email or via SMS.

4. Once you have gotten the code, insert the new SIM card (from your new carrier). You will receive a prompt to enter your code. Make sure that you key in the right code---entering the wrong code will cause your phone to be locked (possibly forever).

## Part 6: The downside of an unlocked Realme V30T

Are you thinking "Well, why can't I just buy an unlocked Realme V30T in the first place?" right about now? Well, you can but think of the amount of money it will cost you.

Most importantly, if you have a locked device, always seek advice from your carrier to see if this is possible.

### 3\. Unlock your Phone Fast & Secure

Download Link: [https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.unlockscope.app&hl=en](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.unlockscope.app&hl=en)

The major selling point of this app is that it supports a wide range of Android device. Using it however is not as easy as the ones we've seen above. You have to provide a lot of information about the Realme V30T device before you can be provided with the unlocking code. Also, the app charges the user per unlocking code provided. The code is sent to the user's email address which also further complicates the process.
