## Part 4: How to check if my iPhone is unlocked or not

Before you take some drastic and time consuming measures it might be helpful to confirm whether you already have an unlocked phone. If you have a SIM with a separate network provider you can simply enter it and see whether it's accessible. However, if you don't currently have another SIM card, you can use DoctorSIM to also verify your unlock status with 3 simple steps. To do so you need to first go to this link[here](https://www.doctorsim.com/libtrkafl.html?pc=43d47c30d945bcbd7d9527f4049f649a&refe=https://www.doctorsim.com/us-en/?scp&euro)

### Check your Apple iPhone 13 Pro Max unlock status

#### **Step 1:** Retrieve IMEI

Type #06# on your Apple iPhone 13 Pro Max keypad to get the IMEI Code.

#### **Step 2:** Fill in the Request Form

Next, enter the first 15 digits of the IMEI code, followed by your email address.

#### **Step 3:** Receive Email

You'll soon receive an email with your unlock status.

And just like that you now know whether to go ahead to unlock T Mobile iPhone!

## Part 5: I've unlocked my iPhone. What's next?

So you've gone through whichever process most suited you and now you've even entered the T Mobile iPhone unlock code. But now you're left wondering, well now what? What's next? Well, what's next is that you make use of your new-found freedom, to break your phone in by using a different SIM, using one of these scenarios!

### I have SIM with a different Network Provider

In this case just follow the following steps:

1\. Remove old SIM Card.

2\. Enter new SIM Card.

3\. Restart iPhone.

### I don't have another SIM

In this case the process is a little longer. Do the following to activate the unlock:

#### **Step 1:** Back Up

You can back up easily with iCloud. It is a very simple solution. Simply go to settings on your Apple iPhone 13 Pro Max, followed by 'iCloud', then tap 'Back up now.'

#### **Step 2:** Erase iPhone

Go to Settings> General> Reset> Erase All Content. This will wipe your phone clean.

#### **Step 3:** Restore

Finally, just restore all the information from the iCloud back up. This is also fairly simple. As you follow the system setup after erasing, you'll be taken to the 'Apps & Data' screen. Simply select 'Restore from iCloud Backup.'

With that your Apple iPhone 13 Pro Max is now completely unlock activated! You're free to use it as you please now.

In this article we've explained how to unlock T Mobile Apple iPhone 13 Pro Max using DoctorSIM - SIM Unlock Service, and how to unlock T Mobile iPhone 5s using the T Mobile carrier itself. While both of them are perfectly legitimate means of unlocking your Apple iPhone 13 Pro Maxs, I personally lean more towards the DoctorSIM solution as they don't have any pesky eligibility criteria, nor do they make you wait long. They are a 100% solution, especially considering they're a third-party tool which makes them less biased as they don't have an incentive to keep you from unlocking. Well, we hope this helped and hopefully now you have a T Mobile unlock iPhone!
