### 1\. No Due Before Unlocking

When iPhone users sign contracts with a giant cell phone company for a certain amount of time, they often get a discount on a device. Because of this, the Apple iPhone 13 Pro device comes with a controller lock so customers can only use it on their network.

So, if you've paid off your contract or bought your Apple iPhone 13 Pro without a subsidy, it's perfectly legal to unlock it. But if you're still paying off your contract, you still need to own the Apple iPhone 13 Pro fully, so you should confirm with your carrier before unlocking it.

### 2\. You Should Buy It for More Than the Time Limit in the Contract

You can leave without paying anything if your agreement with the company is over. If you signed a contract in exchange for a lower price upfront, you would have to wait until your contract ended (usually 24 months) or pay the remaining balance if you bought your phone on a payment plan.

### Examples: Requirements of Sim Unlock of T-Mobile/EE/AT&T

T-Mobile, EE, and AT&T have common requirements before you can unlock your Apple iPhone 13 Pro.

- It has to be legal. It means the Apple iPhone 13 Pro device has not been reported as lost, stolen, or linked to a crime.
- Your bank account shouldn't have any debts.
- If you signed a contract in exchange for a lower price upfront, you would have to wait until your contract was up (usually 24 months) or pay the remaining balance if you bought your phone on a payment plan.

Apart from the requirements mentioned above, each company has its way of unlocking.

**T-Mobile**

![t mobile](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/12/unlock-iphone-x-1.jpg)

Following are the unlocking requirements of T-Mobile.

- The device had been connected to the T-Mobile network for at least 40 days before the request to unlock it was made.

- The phone's prepaid plan must have at least $50 worth of recharges paid for.
- If you meet the above requirements, you can call customer service at 611 from the Apple iPhone 13 Pro device you want to unlock to unlock an iPhone 11 or 12 that is locked to a T-Mobile network.
- When you call about tips, make sure you have ALL of the following:

1. The main account holder's phone number
2. Account Password
3. Account holder's SSN's last four digits
4. IMEI number. You can find this by navigating Settings > General > About or dialing \*#06#.

## How to Unlock Apple iPhone 13 Pro with IMEI Code?

If you have a locked iPhone, we have different methods that entail how to unlock iPhone with IMEI code. Apart from this, we have two separate unlocking methods which usually confuse a good number of people. These methods are Sim Unlock and iCloud activation lock bypass. The difference between the two is that the Sim unlock method involves unlocking the sim lock while the iCloud activation revolves around unlocking the automatic iCloud activation security feature.  

If you want to know how to unlock iPhone with IMEI number and how to bypass iCloud lock, I have with me two different methods that will unlock your locked iPhone in a span of days as long as you follow the required steps.  

## Part 1: What is IMEI code? How to find IMEI Code on iPhone?

Each and every phone comes with a unique 15-digit code that differentiates it from other devices. This unique code acts as determinant or a tracking number when you happen to lose your phone. For those with iPhones, you can retrieve this unique number in different ways. The following are some of them.

**1.1 Dial \*#06#**

This is the primary method of checking your IMEI code on almost all devices. On your dial pad, dial \*#06# and press the call icon. Your unique code will be displayed immediately.

![*#06#](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2016/10/14768818248097.jpg)

**1.2 The Sim Tray**

Another way of retrieving your IMEI code is by removing your Sim Card tray. In most devices especially iPhone 4, this number is usually located on the Sim tray.
