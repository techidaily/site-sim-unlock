**Disclaimer:** It’s vital to note that unlocking methods, particularly with third-party tools, may not always be successful, especially for newer iPhone models and iOS versions. Also, using third-party unlocking tools can void your phone’s warranty, leaving you responsible for any future repairs not covered by the manufacturer.

## Method 3: Using Online Unlockers To Unlock Telstra iPhones

While venturing into the online realm, you might encounter websites offering remote unlocking services for a fee. These services claim to **unlock your Telstra phone** quickly and conveniently, often without contacting the carrier. However, approaching this method requires extreme caution due to potential risks and legal implications.

Before diving in:

- **Understand the risks.**Online unlocking services operate in a gray area, potentially violating your carrier’s terms and conditions. This could lead to legal trouble or void your phone’s warranty.
- **Beware of scams.**Unfortunately, not all online unlocking services are legitimate. Many are scams designed to steal your money or personal information.
- **Do your research.**If you choose to proceed, thoroughly research the service provider. Read reviews from other users, check their track record, and ensure they have a good reputation.

These services typically require you to provide your phone’s IMEI number and pay a fee. They then claim to use various methods, often software or network vulnerabilities, to unlock your phone remotely. However, the success rate and security of these methods are highly questionable. Thus, relying on Dr.Fone as an alternative unlocking method is recommended.

From data recovery to system repair, its diverse functionalities can enhance your mobile experience in various ways.

### Contact your carrier to unlock it with the IMEI code

When a customer deals an agreement with a large cell phone company for a certain amount of time, they usually get a discount on a device. Because of this, the Apple iPhone 7 Plus device has a controller lock, so customers can only use it on their network. You can leave without paying anything if your contract with the company is over. Before you can unlock your Apple iPhone 7 Plus, you have to do the following:

First, it has to be legal. It means the Apple iPhone 7 Plus device has not been reported as lost, stolen, or linked to a crime.

Then your bank account shouldn't have any debts. If you signed a contract in exchange for a lower price upfront, you would have to wait until your contract was up (usually 24 months) or pay the remaining balance if you bought your phone on a payment plan. Each company has its way of unlocking.
