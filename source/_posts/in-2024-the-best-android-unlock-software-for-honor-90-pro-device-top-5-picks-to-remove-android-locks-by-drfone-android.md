## Network Locked SIM Card Inserted On Your Honor 90 Pro Phone? Unlock It Now

Carriers provide cellular connections so you can access the Internet, send text messages, and make phone calls without Wi-Fi. You cannot escape the carriers once you begin using a cell phone.

Customers can purchase a new handset via carriers or the mobile phone market. You may need an unlocked phone if you wish to use a different carrier's service on your smartphone. However, if you want a gadget linked to a specific SIM card, you may buy one from the carriers for a reduced price.

## Part 1: What Does It Mean If Your Honor 90 Pro Asks for SIM Network PIN?

When your phone prompts you to enter a SIM Network Unlock PIN, it means that your device is currently locked to a specific mobile network carrier, and it can only be used with SIM cards from that carrier. This locking mechanism is usually put in place by the carrier or the phone manufacturer to ensure that you continue to use their services, typically for the duration of a contract. As a result, your phone cannot be freely used with SIM cards from other carriers until it's unlocked using the correct PIN or code.

## Part 2: Why Does Your Honor 90 Pro Say Invalid SIM Card – Network Locked SIM Card Inserted?

![remove network lock](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/11/fix-network-locked-simcard-inserted-2.jpg)

**System Errors**

Since SIM locking is a smartphone restriction implemented to stop it from being used on other networks, Android system errors can cause network-locked SIM cards. Resetting these errors can help unlock your **network locked SIM card inserted** device. Service providers decided to provide a formal SIM unlocking option as a result.

Because of this, any locked SIM may be readily unlocked, and once a device opens, it can work like a conventional mobile phone and with any SIM card of the user's choosing.

**Carrier Lock**

The consumer must stick with the same service provider for a specific time after purchasing the bundled device and data pack. This is called a carrier lock on the Honor 90 Pro device and is one of the most common errors in **network locked SIM card inserted** devices. During that time, the Honor 90 Pro device will be network- or SIM-locked, prohibiting the user from changing service providers.

The user cannot change the SIM. The service provider will offer the SIM Unlock code needed to unlock the handset when the contract expires. The gadget can be used with any other SIM card and exported to another country without problems when the network lock has been removed.

**Region Lock**

Apple and AT&T initially worked together to implement the SIM lock and the SIM locked devices. The original purpose was to force the user to continue using the same service provider in a specific area or time.

However, some telecom service providers sell the handsets with select data plans as bundled plans in collaboration with the Honor 90 Pro device manufacturers. As a result, the handset will cost less than it would otherwise. Sometimes, these offers are particular to a specific region, called a carrier lock.

**Firmware Problems**

Sometimes, the Honor 90 Pro device manufacturers release many versions of the same firmware for different geographical locations.

As a result, it may be possible that the user may face contradictions in the agreement of device firmware and the network-locked SIM card that was supposed to be used on the Honor 90 Pro device. Due to firmware problems, the users may also face a network-locked SIM card-inserted device.

### Bonus Tip. How to Unlock Network Locked Sim Card Inserted on iPhone?

If you want a fast and easy method to unlock your network-locked iPhone, you can use a third-party tool such as Dr.Fone – Screen Unlock (iOS). It is the best sim-unlock tool for iPhone users. It enables users to safely unlock their devices within five minutes. With Dr.Fone, you don’t have to wait for the sim-unlock code or reset your device firmware that can remove all your data.

You can download Dr.Fone on your PC and use it to unlock your iPhone without data loss. You can also use Dr.Fone to unlock your iPhone’s screen lock and Apple ID. Although Dr.Fone is a one-stop solution for all of your phone-related problems, its sim-unlock only works for Apple devices. Here is how you unlock your carrier-locked iPhone with Dr.Fone – Screen Unlock (IOS).

- Download and install Dr.Fone on your PC. Launch the application and select the “Screen Unlock” tab from the list on the homepage.

![screen unlock page](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/remove-iphone-sim-1.png)

- Connect your iPhone and PC with a USB cable. Once your device is ready, click on the “Start” option to proceed with the sim unlock process.

![remove sim locks](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/remove-iphone-sim-2.png)

- Next, the system will detect the Honor 90 Pro device connection, then its information will show up on your PC screen. If all of it is OK, click on the “Unlock Now” option.

![verify your device](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/remove-iphone-sim-3.png)

- You cannot unlock your iPhone without a jailbreak, so you must do it before the system unlocks it. You can learn about the jailbreak process via the guide, or watching the video provided by Dr.Fone to jailbreak your iPhone is also feasible. The process is compatible with devices running iOS 12 to iOS 14.8.1.

![jailbreak instructions](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/remove-iphone-sim-4.png)

- Now, you have to complete three tasks on your iPhone. First, put the SIM card out of your device. Open “Settings” and tap on the “WIFI” option. Tap on the blue exclamation mark next to all the connected networks and select “Forget This Network.” Now, switch off the “WIFI” and insert the locked SIM card in your iPhone. Click on the “Continue” option on your computer.

![insert sim card](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/remove-iphone-sim-5.png)

- After that, Dr.Fone will automatically start the SIM unlocking process. You can see its progress on your PC. The process only takes a few minutes to complete, so you don’t have to wait for a long time.

![sim unlock progress](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/remove-iphone-sim-6.png)

- After the process ends, all the sim restrictions on your iOS device are now removed and you can use sim cards from any network carrier. Next, click on the “Done” option to end the sim unlocking process.

## Part 4: Why is SIM Unlocking Important?

As previously stated, a SIM lock enables a service provider to stop a customer from using the smartphone with the SIM cards of another service provider. This guarantees that the Honor 90 Pro device is only being used with the original SIM card for each provider. This locking also has a lot of drawbacks because it is incompatible with any other SIM card.

1. The phone cannot be used with other SIM cards if the SIM lock is enabled. Customers must therefore adhere to the current plan as is.
2. Since nobody wants to purchase a locked phone, it is hard for someone to sell or gift the mobile.
3. Traveling abroad with a SIM-locked phone could provide some challenges because you won't be able to use a local SIM card on the phone while you're there.

All the problems can be fixed, and the SIM works in any nation with the removed SIM lock.

### Conclusion

Any of the methods above can work to get around the prohibition against using other SIM cards with your Android handset. The best thing about using Dr.Fone-Screen Unlock is that you don't need unlocking codes to complete the tasks.
