With that your Apple iPhone 15 Pro is now completely unlock activated! You're free to use it as you please now.

In this article we've explained how to unlock T Mobile Apple iPhone 15 Pro using DoctorSIM - SIM Unlock Service, and how to unlock T Mobile iPhone 5s using the T Mobile carrier itself. While both of them are perfectly legitimate means of unlocking your Apple iPhone 15 Pros, I personally lean more towards the DoctorSIM solution as they don't have any pesky eligibility criteria, nor do they make you wait long. They are a 100% solution, especially considering they're a third-party tool which makes them less biased as they don't have an incentive to keep you from unlocking. Well, we hope this helped and hopefully now you have a T Mobile unlock iPhone!

To unlock your device, you have two options, you can either use the **free Boost mobile unlock code** that is the official way of unlocking the Apple iPhone 15 Pro device (though it requires several prerequisites), or can opt for a third-party tool.

## Part1: What Will Get After unlocking Boost Mobile?

Before you go for the **Boost mobile device unlock**, the very first thing to know is why do you want to unlock your device and what will be its benefits. Some of the major scenarios that you can achieve by unlocking your Apple iPhone 15 Pro are listed below.

### Switching to other networks offering more lucrative and suitable deals

There is quite a possibility that during your Boost plan you may find a deal or an offer by another carrier that is more lucrative, pocket friendly, and meet all your requirements. In such situations, you would want to unlock your device and shift to another carrier to avail of the deal.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### Using a second-hand device having a locked carrier

If you have bought a second-hand device having the locked carrier or paid monthly contracts, you would need to first need to unlock the Apple iPhone 15 Pro device to use it. It might happen that the original owner of the phone might have a locked carrier plan on their device which they missed ending up before selling the phone. So, as a new buyer, you would need to unlock it to enable it with your choice of the carrier.

### An unlocked phone will fetch you better prices while selling it

If you are planning to sell your phone, then it is advisable to unlock its carrier for bargaining a better deal and pricing. A buyer would always want an iPhone where they can use their choice of network and carrier and thus if you unlock your phone, you can fetch better prices in comparison to the locked phone.

### Allows connecting to network overseas without activating roaming

If you use a locked carrier on your phone, you would need to activate roaming while traveling overseas and this would be quite pricey. Here unlocking proves to be quite beneficial as with the unlocked device, you can opt for the overseas carrier network and thus there will be no need for any roaming activation.

## Part2: How to Unlock Boost Mobile iPhone with Boost Customers Service

The Boost phones are locked with their network, the company has an official way by which you can unlock your devices provided you meet the edibility criteria. The Boost mobile phones run on the CDMA network and most of the latest phones are cross-compatible with all the carriers.

If you are planning to unlock your Boost mobile using the official method, you would need to meet up the eligibility requirements. The company will not notify you regarding eligibility criteria and thus you need to do your homework and find them all on your own. In this regard, we are here to help you and have listed the requirements you need to unlock your device as below.

- The mobile must have been used and operational for at least a period of 12 months with the Boost Mobile network.
- For the 12-month activation anniversary, the payment must be made within the last 90 days.
- The phone should not be reported as lost or stolen.
- The phone must be capable of SIM unlock (though most of the phones are).
- The account standing of your Boost Mobile should be good which means there should be no unpaid bills.

_**Tip**: Boost mobile and similar other carriers have an online compatibility checker function that can let you check if your device will work on their network or not._

The following are the procedures for unlocking Boost phones in different scenarios

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### Unlocking Boost Phone- Military Requirements

For the military personnel, the **Boost Mobile SIM unlock** will be done after the proof of deployment is submitted. Also, for the military people, there is no restriction about the minimum amount of time the Apple iPhone 15 Pro device should be used with the Boost mobile. A military account number is allowed for unlocking up to 2 devices in a year.

### Unlocking Boost Phone for current existing Boost customers

If you are a current customer of Boost and meet all the unlocking eligibility criteria then the process to get your device to unlock involves the following steps.

Step 1. Call the Boost customer service contact number.

Step 2. You will be provided with a **Boost mobile network unlock code**.

Step 3. You need to input the provided code and your device will be unlocked.

Note: For the BoostUP! For installment plan holders, the **Boost Mobile unlock Sim card** process will be done in a day while for the others it might take around 2 days.

A few points that need to be taken care of during the unlocking process are as follows:

- Ensure that your SIM card is in your phone else if you replace or remove the SIM card, your unlocking request might fail.
- Also, make sure that your device during the phase is turned on and is also connected with the Boost Mobile Network or to a WiFi network.

Unlocking phones for the Non-Boost Customers

If you are currently not a Boost customer and have been a customer earlier or have never been a customer and have purchased from a previous owner, you can still get your phone unlocked, though the process becomes a little complicated and the following are the requirements.

- You would need a Boost mobile number or an account number that was last associated with the Apple iPhone 15 Pro device.
- In case you do not have the number, then you will have to get in touch with the previous owner and get these details.

And in case you do not meet either of the above two situations, **Boost mobile carrier unlock** on your device cannot be done and you will first need to use the Boost network for the required time and get yourself eligible for the unlocking process.

_**Tip**: Another important point to consider before buying a device from a third party is to check with the Boost Mobile if the phone is unlocked or if it is eligible. In case you come to know that your device cannot be unlocked, you will not have to worry about the eligibility criteria or requirements._

## Part3: How to Unlock Boost iPhone by Yourself \[Most Efficient\]

To get your device unlocked using the Boost Mobile customer service, you, first of all, need to meet their eligibility criteria. In case you are falling short on one or more of the requirements, or have purchased a second-hand device with a lock your device cannot be unlocked through the official method. So now what? No need to worry as there are third-party tools available to help you in these situations.
