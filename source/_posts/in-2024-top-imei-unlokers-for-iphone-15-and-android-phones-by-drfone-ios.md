## Part 1: What is IMEI code? How to find IMEI Code on iPhone?

Each and every phone comes with a unique 15-digit code that differentiates it from other devices. This unique code acts as determinant or a tracking number when you happen to lose your phone. For those with iPhones, you can retrieve this unique number in different ways. The following are some of them.

**1.1 Dial \*#06#**

This is the primary method of checking your IMEI code on almost all devices. On your dial pad, dial \*#06# and press the call icon. Your unique code will be displayed immediately.
