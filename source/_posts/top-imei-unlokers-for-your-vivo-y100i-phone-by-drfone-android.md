## Part 6: The downside of an unlocked Vivo Y100i

Are you thinking "Well, why can't I just buy an unlocked Vivo Y100i in the first place?" right about now? Well, you can but think of the amount of money it will cost you.

1\. First, enter your phone’s unique IMEI into the site, and then the site checks to ensure that it is genuine.

2\. Choose your phone model from the list provided, and then choose your country. Once you choose your country, a list of supported Service Providers will pop up. Choose your service provider, read the terms and conditions and accept. At this point, click Generate.

3\. The Unlockitfree Generator will show you a series of 7 different unlocking codes. Not all of these will work; usually the best options are the 1st and 7th code on the list.

Hopefully you will have success – although, this is not guaranteed (as it is with the first Dr.Fone option above).
