### Method 2: Some SIM-unlock websites

Following are some popular SIM-Unlock websites you can consider to unlock your Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max.

**AppleiPhoneUnlock**

This website says that it can help you unlock your Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max or iPad. Please prepare your IMEI code and confirm the Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max device model. But when we did some research, I found that this website has some bad customer reviews. So, if you consider using them to unlock your Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max, you should be more careful in checking the availability.

Unlock chip is a small SIM card that can be used along with regular SIM cards.

However, these Sim-unlock chips have some drawbacks. It reduces the Battery life and may cause SIM card slot and SIM card issues.
