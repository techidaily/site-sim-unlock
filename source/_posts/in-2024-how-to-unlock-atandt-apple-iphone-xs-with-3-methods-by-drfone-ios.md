![sim unlock iphone with iphoneimei.net](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2016/06/14670574228916.jpg)

On [iPhoneIMEI.net](https://appleiphoneunlock.uk/network/Special%20Services/Activation%20Lock?aff=wondershare) official website, just select your Apple iPhone XS model and the network carrier your iphone is locked to, it will direct you to another page. Once you have followed the page instruction to finish the order, iPhone IMEI will submit your Apple iPhone XS IMEI to the carrier provider and whitelist your device from Apple database. It usually takes 1-5 days. After it's unlocked, you will receive an email notification.

This is an alternative means by which you can AT&T unlock iPhone. It is a tad more cumbersome and may take a little more time, but is another legitimate means you could opt for should you wish to do so. This is done by directly getting in contact with your Carrier. If you already know that your carrier is AT&T, you can contact them directly and get your Apple iPhone XS unlocked as follows:

#### **Step 1:** Go to their Site and Contact them

1\. Go to [https://www.att.com/deviceunlock/?#/](https://www.att.com/deviceunlock/?#/) first. This is the official location whereby you can contact them.

2\. The page will list out certain eligibility requirements. You have to read and agree to them before clicking 'Continue.'

![unlock att iphone via att carrier](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2016/10/14769325349486.jpg)

3\. Next, you have to fill up the Request Form, including details about your Wireless number.

![fill the form to unlock iphone att](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2016/10/14769326985388.jpg)

#### **Step 2:** Email confirmation

1\. You'll receive the unlock request number via email.

2\. You need to click on the provided link within 24 hours in order for your unlock request to be officially accepted.

#### **Step 3:** Response

1\. You should hear back from AT&T within 2 days.

2\. If your request has been successful, they'll send you further instructions about how to unlock your Apple iPhone XS.

### Requirements

However, AT&T has the right to dismiss anyone's request based on several requirements and criteria, so your application may yet be either rejected or you may have to go through further steps. It is a good idea to go through their requirements before you fill their form.

1\. The obvious requirement is that your Apple iPhone XS must be locked to AT&T, else you should go to the relevant carrier page.

2\. You iPhone couldn't have been reported as either lost or stolen.

3\. No record of it having been linked to any criminal or fraudulent activities.

4\. All termination fees have been paid in full, and all the other iPhone installment plans, etc, have been completed.

5\. After upgrading iPhone you must wait 14 days before you're eligible for unlock.

Finding out how to unlock AT&T iPhone can be harrowing if you don't know where to look, especially because performing the unlock can be so crucial for many people in order to access other carriers.

Both the options mentioned above offer a legitimate means by which you can AT&T unlock your Apple iPhone XS, whether done without a SIM card or by contacting the AT&T carrier.

However, going by personal experience the DoctorSIM alternative offers a much smoother, efficient and quicker alternative to contacting the AT&T carriers. It is also more secure because if you are going via the carrier without a SIM card then you'll need to back up your Apple iPhone XS, then delete and restore it as well (for security measures). This isn't just a time consuming process, but it can also prove to be risky. Furthermore, AT&T has a lot of checks and requisites in place which can keep your Apple iPhone XS from being unlocked, and even if you do pass the requisites it's still a time-consuming process which may still be rejected as AT&T has final say. As such, going via DoctorSIM gives you complete agency and conveniently AT&T unlocks iPhone without any data loss, through a simple 3 step process.

Among Dr.Fone’s features lies the coveted “SIM Unlock” functionality. This tool aims to remove carrier-imposed restrictions, allowing your Telstra Apple iPhone XS to work with other compatible networks. While seemingly convenient, it’s essential to understand the nuances before proceeding.

Dr.Fone’s SIM Unlock can bypass the carrier lock on your Apple iPhone XS, enabling it to operate with SIM cards from different networks.

### How Does Dr.Fone’s SIM Unlock Work?

The steps involved in using Dr.Fone’s SIM Unlock vary depending on your Apple iPhone XS and iOS version.. Generally, the process involves connecting your Apple iPhone XS to your computer, selecting the “SIM Unlock” function, and following the on-screen prompts. To be more specific, follow the steps below:

- **Step 1:** Download and install [Wondershare Dr.Fone](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/drfone-toolkit/) from the official website and launch it on your computer.


- **Step 2:** On the Dr.Fone homepage, go to **Toolbox > Screen Unlock > iOS**. Connect your Apple iPhone XS with the appropriate cable, too.

**Disclaimer:** It’s vital to note that unlocking methods, particularly with third-party tools, may not always be successful, especially for newer iPhone models and iOS versions. Also, using third-party unlocking tools can void your phone’s warranty, leaving you responsible for any future repairs not covered by the manufacturer.

## Method 3: Using Online Unlockers To Unlock Telstra iPhones

While venturing into the online realm, you might encounter websites offering remote unlocking services for a fee. These services claim to **unlock your Telstra phone** quickly and conveniently, often without contacting the carrier. However, approaching this method requires extreme caution due to potential risks and legal implications.

Before diving in:

- **Understand the risks.**Online unlocking services operate in a gray area, potentially violating your carrier’s terms and conditions. This could lead to legal trouble or void your phone’s warranty.
- **Beware of scams.**Unfortunately, not all online unlocking services are legitimate. Many are scams designed to steal your money or personal information.
- **Do your research.**If you choose to proceed, thoroughly research the service provider. Read reviews from other users, check their track record, and ensure they have a good reputation.

These services typically require you to provide your phone’s IMEI number and pay a fee. They then claim to use various methods, often software or network vulnerabilities, to unlock your phone remotely. However, the success rate and security of these methods are highly questionable. Thus, relying on Dr.Fone as an alternative unlocking method is recommended.

## Conclusion

**Unlocking Telstra iPhones** gives you network flexibility, but navigating the process requires a measured approach. Remember, while Telstra’s official methods offer a guaranteed and secure path to freedom, third-party tools like Wondershare Dr.Fone present a potential avenue for those seeking alternative solutions.

After all, Wondershare Dr.Fone remains a valuable tool for your broader phone needs. From data recovery to system repair, its diverse functionalities can enhance your mobile experience in various ways. You can use it as an all-in-one application for all your needs, from network unlocking to system repair.
