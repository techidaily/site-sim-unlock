## How to Unlock Apple iPhone XS with IMEI Code?

If you have a locked iPhone, we have different methods that entail how to unlock iPhone with IMEI code. Apart from this, we have two separate unlocking methods which usually confuse a good number of people. These methods are Sim Unlock and iCloud activation lock bypass. The difference between the two is that the Sim unlock method involves unlocking the sim lock while the iCloud activation revolves around unlocking the automatic iCloud activation security feature.  

If you want to know how to unlock iPhone with IMEI number and how to bypass iCloud lock, I have with me two different methods that will unlock your locked iPhone in a span of days as long as you follow the required steps.  

## Part 1: What is IMEI code? How to find IMEI Code on iPhone?

Each and every phone comes with a unique 15-digit code that differentiates it from other devices. This unique code acts as determinant or a tracking number when you happen to lose your phone. For those with iPhones, you can retrieve this unique number in different ways. The following are some of them.

**1.1 Dial \*#06#**

This is the primary method of checking your IMEI code on almost all devices. On your dial pad, dial \*#06# and press the call icon. Your unique code will be displayed immediately.

**1.2 The Sim Tray**

Another way of retrieving your IMEI code is by removing your Sim Card tray. In most devices especially iPhone 4, this number is usually located on the Sim tray.

## Part 1: What Should You Do Before Apple iPhone XS SIM Unlock?

Before unlocking your Apple iPhone XS from the carrier, you should fulfill the following criteria.

### 1\. No Due Before Unlocking

When iPhone users sign contracts with a giant cell phone company for a certain amount of time, they often get a discount on a device. Because of this, the Apple iPhone XS device comes with a controller lock so customers can only use it on their network.

So, if you've paid off your contract or bought your Apple iPhone XS without a subsidy, it's perfectly legal to unlock it. But if you're still paying off your contract, you still need to own the Apple iPhone XS fully, so you should confirm with your carrier before unlocking it.

### 2\. You Should Buy It for More Than the Time Limit in the Contract

You can leave without paying anything if your agreement with the company is over. If you signed a contract in exchange for a lower price upfront, you would have to wait until your contract ended (usually 24 months) or pay the remaining balance if you bought your phone on a payment plan.

### Examples: Requirements of Sim Unlock of T-Mobile/EE/AT&T

T-Mobile, EE, and AT&T have common requirements before you can unlock your Apple iPhone XS.

- It has to be legal. It means the Apple iPhone XS device has not been reported as lost, stolen, or linked to a crime.
- Your bank account shouldn't have any debts.
- If you signed a contract in exchange for a lower price upfront, you would have to wait until your contract was up (usually 24 months) or pay the remaining balance if you bought your phone on a payment plan.

Apart from the requirements mentioned above, each company has its way of unlocking.

**T-Mobile**

Following are the unlocking requirements of T-Mobile.

- The device had been connected to the T-Mobile network for at least 40 days before the request to unlock it was made.

- The phone's prepaid plan must have at least $50 worth of recharges paid for.
- If you meet the above requirements, you can call customer service at 611 from the Apple iPhone XS device you want to unlock to unlock an iPhone 11 or 12 that is locked to a T-Mobile network.
- When you call about tips, make sure you have ALL of the following:

1. The main account holder's phone number
2. Account Password
3. Account holder's SSN's last four digits
4. IMEI number. You can find this by navigating Settings > General > About or dialing \*#06#.

**EE**

![ee](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/12/unlock-iphone-x-3.jpg)

Following are the unlocking requirements of EE.

### A Quick Look at the Professional Phone Unlocking Tool: Wondershare Dr.Fone

[Wondershare Dr.Fone](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/drfone-toolkit/) is a comprehensive software suite catering to various smartphone needs, including data recovery, system repair, and device unlocking, which is relevant to our discussion.

Among Dr.Fone’s features lies the coveted “SIM Unlock” functionality. This tool aims to remove carrier-imposed restrictions, allowing your Telstra Apple iPhone XS to work with other compatible networks. While seemingly convenient, it’s essential to understand the nuances before proceeding.

Dr.Fone’s SIM Unlock can bypass the carrier lock on your Apple iPhone XS, enabling it to operate with SIM cards from different networks.

### How Does Dr.Fone’s SIM Unlock Work?

The steps involved in using Dr.Fone’s SIM Unlock vary depending on your Apple iPhone XS and iOS version.. Generally, the process involves connecting your Apple iPhone XS to your computer, selecting the “SIM Unlock” function, and following the on-screen prompts. To be more specific, follow the steps below:

**Disclaimer:** It’s vital to note that unlocking methods, particularly with third-party tools, may not always be successful, especially for newer iPhone models and iOS versions. Also, using third-party unlocking tools can void your phone’s warranty, leaving you responsible for any future repairs not covered by the manufacturer.

## Method 3: Using Online Unlockers To Unlock Telstra iPhones

While venturing into the online realm, you might encounter websites offering remote unlocking services for a fee. These services claim to **unlock your Telstra phone** quickly and conveniently, often without contacting the carrier. However, approaching this method requires extreme caution due to potential risks and legal implications.

Before diving in:

- **Understand the risks.**Online unlocking services operate in a gray area, potentially violating your carrier’s terms and conditions. This could lead to legal trouble or void your phone’s warranty.
- **Beware of scams.**Unfortunately, not all online unlocking services are legitimate. Many are scams designed to steal your money or personal information.
- **Do your research.**If you choose to proceed, thoroughly research the service provider. Read reviews from other users, check their track record, and ensure they have a good reputation.

These services typically require you to provide your phone’s IMEI number and pay a fee. They then claim to use various methods, often software or network vulnerabilities, to unlock your phone remotely. However, the success rate and security of these methods are highly questionable. Thus, relying on Dr.Fone as an alternative unlocking method is recommended.

## Conclusion

**Unlocking Telstra iPhones** gives you network flexibility, but navigating the process requires a measured approach. Remember, while Telstra’s official methods offer a guaranteed and secure path to freedom, third-party tools like Wondershare Dr.Fone present a potential avenue for those seeking alternative solutions.

After all, Wondershare Dr.Fone remains a valuable tool for your broader phone needs. From data recovery to system repair, its diverse functionalities can enhance your mobile experience in various ways. You can use it as an all-in-one application for all your needs, from network unlocking to system repair.
