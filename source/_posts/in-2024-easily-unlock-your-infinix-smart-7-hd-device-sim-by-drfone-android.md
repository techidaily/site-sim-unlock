## Part 1: What Does It Mean If Your Infinix Smart 7 HD Asks for SIM Network PIN?

When your phone prompts you to enter a SIM Network Unlock PIN, it means that your device is currently locked to a specific mobile network carrier, and it can only be used with SIM cards from that carrier. This locking mechanism is usually put in place by the carrier or the phone manufacturer to ensure that you continue to use their services, typically for the duration of a contract. As a result, your phone cannot be freely used with SIM cards from other carriers until it's unlocked using the correct PIN or code.

![sim locked](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/11/fix-network-locked-simcard-inserted-01.jpg)

## Part 2: Why Does Your Infinix Smart 7 HD Say Invalid SIM Card – Network Locked SIM Card Inserted?

![remove network lock](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/11/fix-network-locked-simcard-inserted-2.jpg)

**System Errors**

Since SIM locking is a smartphone restriction implemented to stop it from being used on other networks, Android system errors can cause network-locked SIM cards. Resetting these errors can help unlock your **network locked SIM card inserted** device. Service providers decided to provide a formal SIM unlocking option as a result.

Because of this, any locked SIM may be readily unlocked, and once a device opens, it can work like a conventional mobile phone and with any SIM card of the user's choosing.

**Carrier Lock**

The consumer must stick with the same service provider for a specific time after purchasing the bundled device and data pack. This is called a carrier lock on the Infinix Smart 7 HD device and is one of the most common errors in **network locked SIM card inserted** devices. During that time, the Infinix Smart 7 HD device will be network- or SIM-locked, prohibiting the user from changing service providers.

The user cannot change the SIM. The service provider will offer the SIM Unlock code needed to unlock the handset when the contract expires. The gadget can be used with any other SIM card and exported to another country without problems when the network lock has been removed.

**Region Lock**

Apple and AT&T initially worked together to implement the SIM lock and the SIM locked devices. The original purpose was to force the user to continue using the same service provider in a specific area or time.

However, some telecom service providers sell the handsets with select data plans as bundled plans in collaboration with the Infinix Smart 7 HD device manufacturers. As a result, the handset will cost less than it would otherwise. Sometimes, these offers are particular to a specific region, called a carrier lock.

**Firmware Problems**

Sometimes, the Infinix Smart 7 HD device manufacturers release many versions of the same firmware for different geographical locations.

As a result, it may be possible that the user may face contradictions in the agreement of device firmware and the network-locked SIM card that was supposed to be used on the Infinix Smart 7 HD device. Due to firmware problems, the users may also face a network-locked SIM card-inserted device.

## Part 4: Why is SIM Unlocking Important?

As previously stated, a SIM lock enables a service provider to stop a customer from using the smartphone with the SIM cards of another service provider. This guarantees that the Infinix Smart 7 HD device is only being used with the original SIM card for each provider. This locking also has a lot of drawbacks because it is incompatible with any other SIM card.

1. The phone cannot be used with other SIM cards if the SIM lock is enabled. Customers must therefore adhere to the current plan as is.
2. Since nobody wants to purchase a locked phone, it is hard for someone to sell or gift the mobile.
3. Traveling abroad with a SIM-locked phone could provide some challenges because you won't be able to use a local SIM card on the phone while you're there.

All the problems can be fixed, and the SIM works in any nation with the removed SIM lock.

### Conclusion

Any of the methods above can work to get around the prohibition against using other SIM cards with your Android handset. The best thing about using Dr.Fone-Screen Unlock is that you don't need unlocking codes to complete the tasks.

### There are several uses of the IMEI number

1. As the use of mobile devices increases, the statistics of stolen and lost devices have been increasing as well. Users can block stolen or lost devices for further usage if they know their IMEI number. All users need to call their network carrier and report that the Infinix Smart 7 HD device is stolen or lost. The carrier can block the specific device from running on their network and notify other carriers.
2. The 15-digit IMEI number indicates the origin and model of the Infinix Smart 7 HD device. The first eight digits indicate the Infinix Smart 7 HD device's origin and its model while the last six digits identify the Infinix Smart 7 HD device's manufacturer.
3. If you subscribe to a mobile tracking service, you can use the IMEI number to track the Infinix Smart 7 HD device---even if it uses a different SIM card.

### Pros and Cons of Changing Android IMEI

Like many other things out there, changing Android IMEI has both advantages and disadvantages. Here are some of them:

**Advantages**

1. Make your Android untraceable. By constantly changing your IMEI, you will throw off the tracks of people using it to stalk you!
2. Fix any invalid IMEI-related issues such as lost or invalid IMEI numbers. Once you change your IMEI, your Android device with the same benefits and features.
3. Obtaining a completely new device ID.
4. Changing the IMEI number to one that indicates it is a newer model, you will be able to enjoy new OS updates by resetting, repairing, and updating your Android device.
5. Have you ever yearned for that cheap BlackBerry plan your network carrier keeps on promoting? The 15-digit IMEI indicates the origin and model of your device. Therefore, by changing your Android's IMEI number to that of a BlackBerry's, you will be able to subscribe to a cheaper mobile plan.

**Disadvantages**

1. Before we begin, we need to make it clear that the process of changing IMEI without root can be illegal in some countries. We advise you to check the laws and regulations in your country before attempting to change your device’s IMEI number. As far as we know, it is legal in Africa and Asia, and illegal in Europe.
2. The IMEI number is hardcoded into your device. Therefore, changing your device’s IMEI number may void your device warranty and cause other issues such as network problems and software instability.
3. Legally, you have forfeited your ownership of your mobile device. When you purchase your device, the seller will jot down the original IMEI number on your receipt. So if you changed your IMEI and lost it, you may not be able to claim it. This is because authorities cannot see if it is truly yours. After all, the IMEI numbers no longer correlate with each other.

## Part 3: Does IMEI Change With SIM Card?

No, swapping or changing the SIM card does not alter the IMEI (International Mobile Equipment Identity). The IMEI persists unchanged throughout the Infinix Smart 7 HD device's lifetime, functioning as a distinctive identifier solely for that particular device.

The IMEI is a 15-digit code assigned to each mobile device. It's separate from the SIM card, which stores information related to the subscriber and the carrier network. The SIM card contains data specific to the subscriber. This includes contacts, text messages, and network-related information. But it does not alter or affect the IMEI of the Infinix Smart 7 HD device.

The IMEI remains the same even if you change SIM cards or switch between different carriers. It's essentially a static identifier tied to the Infinix Smart 7 HD device's hardware. It is used by mobile networks and authorities to identify and track devices on the network.

## Part 4: Does IMEI Change After Factory Reset?

No, performing a factory reset on your mobile device does not change its IMEI (International Mobile Equipment Identity). The IMEI is a unique identifier assigned to the hardware of the Infinix Smart 7 HD device. It remains constant throughout the life of the Infinix Smart 7 HD device, irrespective of any software changes or resets.

A factory reset wipes the data and settings on your device, returning it to its original factory state. This process erases user-installed apps, personal data, and settings. But it doesn’t affect the Infinix Smart 7 HD device's hardware identification, including the IMEI.

The IMEI is embedded into the hardware of the Infinix Smart 7 HD device. It is typically printed on the Infinix Smart 7 HD device's packaging or can be found by dialing \*#06# on the phone's keypad. It's a crucial identifier for mobile networks, and authorities use it to uniquely identify and track devices across networks. It remains unchanged even after a factory reset.
