## How to Unlock Apple iPhone 8 with IMEI Code?

If you have a locked iPhone, we have different methods that entail how to unlock iPhone with IMEI code. Apart from this, we have two separate unlocking methods which usually confuse a good number of people. These methods are Sim Unlock and iCloud activation lock bypass. The difference between the two is that the Sim unlock method involves unlocking the sim lock while the iCloud activation revolves around unlocking the automatic iCloud activation security feature.  

If you want to know how to unlock iPhone with IMEI number and how to bypass iCloud lock, I have with me two different methods that will unlock your locked iPhone in a span of days as long as you follow the required steps.  

## Part 1: What is IMEI code? How to find IMEI Code on iPhone?

Each and every phone comes with a unique 15-digit code that differentiates it from other devices. This unique code acts as determinant or a tracking number when you happen to lose your phone.

**1.1 Dial \*#06#**

This is the primary method of checking your IMEI code on almost all devices. On your dial pad, dial \*#06# and press the call icon. Your unique code will be displayed immediately.

Many people find it difficult to unlock their MetroPCS iPhone and resort to buying a new phone altogether to use it with another service provider. In this article, you will learn how to use the MetroPCS unlock phones feature with three different methods. So, let’s get started!

### 1\. Calling MetroPCS to Unlock Phones

The first and most straightforward method to carrier unlocks MetroPCS phone is to call the company. But before you do that, make sure whether your phone has GSM/LTE or CDMA technology. Check for the small slot on the side of your phone to see whether there’s a SIM.

If you have any problems during the sim unlocking process, you can follow [the Sim unlock guide](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/iphone-unlock/) in detail to carrier unlock the MetroPCS phone. This process involves several steps and might seem long, but it hardly takes 5 to 10 minutes. Also, it is the safest and most reliable way with a high success rate to unlock iPhone MetroPCS.

If you’re looking for a way to unlock your MetroPCS phone for free but without going through technical steps, you can use the Apple iPhone 8 device Unlock app.

### 3\. Unlock MetroPCS Phone Using an App

The Device Unlock app is automatically installed in MetroPCS-locked phones, so you can easily find it in the apps folder or the MetroPCS folder. However, this app is only compatible with Android devices.

So, if you have an Android phone, follow these steps to unlock it using the Apple iPhone 8 device Unlock app:

**Step 1**

Connect your phone to a Wi-Fi internet connection, and launch the Apple iPhone 8 device Unlock app.

![unlock iphone metropcs app](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/05/unlock-iphone-metropcs-app-02.jpg)

**Step 3**

Once your device has been unlocked, the app will ask you to restart your phone, after which the Apple iPhone 8 device will be permanently unlocked, and you can use any network's sim card on it.

### Troubleshooting Issues

It is possible that when you use the Apple iPhone 8 device Unlock app, some error messages might pop up. Here are the common errors and their solutions:

1. If you get the following errors:

- Data corrupted
- Server not responding
- No internet connection
- Failure to apply to unlock

Turn off your Wi-Fi, and move to a place that has strong signals. Now turn your Wi-Fi back on and try again.

2. If you get the “Data not recognized” errors, you’ll have to unroot your phone. For this, search for the unroot guide for your smartphone’s specific model and follow the instructions.

3. For the “System maintenance error,” wait for a few hours and then try again, as the system might be going through maintenance and won’t process the unlock.

### Q. How can I tell if My Apple iPhone 8 is eligible to unlock if it's MetroPCS?

MetroPCS has some eligibility requirements to unlock your Apple iPhone 8. The criteria to be eligible are:

1. You must have purchased your Apple iPhone 8 from MetroPCS.
2. The device to be unlocked must not be stolen, lost, or blocked.
3. The device must be activated for 180 days to be eligible to be unlocked.

If you fulfill these requirements, your phone is eligible to be unlocked.

### Q. What do I do if I unlock My Apple iPhone 8 and now my SIM card doesn't work?

If you get this error, it means that the SIM card you have inserted into the Apple iPhone 8 device is not supported by the activation policy assigned by the activation server. To solve this issue, you need a SIM from a supported carrier and request them to unlock the iPhone.

### Conclusion

If you own an iPhone locked by MetroPCS but want to use another carrier’s SIM on it, you will have to unlock your phone first. There are several ways to do so. You can either do it the official way by calling MetroPCS and requesting a MetroPCS unlock code, or you can do it easily by using a third-party unlock tool like Dr.Fone. Then there’s a third way that involves using a device unlock app.

While all 3 ways are easy, they require time and patience, except for Dr.Fone, which lets you unlock your Apple iPhone 8 within 5 minutes. So, save your time and money and go for a reliable and foolproof way to unlock iPhone MetroPCS, the Dr.Fone way!
