## Ways To Find Unlocking Codes For Samsung Galaxy S23 Phones

When you have a locked device, it is pretty much impossible to move from one network to another. This would cause problems if for instance you wanted to travel outside the country and want to switch to that country's carrier for the duration of your stay. Or maybe you just want to switch carriers because you don't like your current provider.

Whatever the reason, you should be able to unlock your device easily. But this has often proven difficult because of the fact that you need unlock codes. The problem is that many sites promise free unlocking codes for your device and many turn out to be fraudulent sites that use the word "free" in their advertising but actually require you to pay for the service. If you have been unsuccessfully searching for free unlocking codes for your device, look no further. This article compiles three of the best for Android and iPhone.

## Part 1: 3 Ways to Find Unlocking Codes for Android Devices

- **3\. Resale value**

An unlocked phone has a higher resale value than a carrier-locked phone. This is because an unlocked phone can be used with any carrier's SIM card, making it more attractive to buyers.

- **4\. No need to buy a new phone**

If you want to switch to a different carrier, you may be tempted to buy a new phone that is compatible with that carrier. However, by unlocking your phone's SIM card, you can use your existing phone with any carrier's SIM card, saving you the cost of buying a new phone.

Even though the name suggests this tool is meant for Nokia phones, the truth is that NokiaFree is a powerful utility that can unlock other brands of phones as well. The software can be downloaded for free, and it is always better to download the latest version from their website. The process of finding your [sim network unlock pin](https://drfone.wondershare.com/unlock/unlock-samsung-sim-network-unlock-pin.html) is so simple, and you'll wonder why you didn't try this utility earlier.

#### How It Works

All that is needed is the IMEI number from Your Samsung Galaxy S23 to generate an unlock code. Just type in \*#06# into your mobile. The IMEI code is then displayed. Copy the 15-digit IMEI code and enter it into the software. You'll get a list of unlocking codes. Try a maximum of four codes to unlock your mobile.

However, this software is totally free and requires only basic details to provide the unlock code.
