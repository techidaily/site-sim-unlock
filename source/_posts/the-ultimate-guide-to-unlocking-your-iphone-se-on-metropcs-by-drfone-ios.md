## The Ultimate Guide to Unlocking Your Apple iPhone SE on MetroPCS

If you own an iPhone that is MetroPCS-branded, the carrier will probably lock it, making it impossible to use a SIM from another carrier on the Apple iPhone SE device. Therefore, you will have to unlock iPhone MetroPCS for this purpose.

Many people find it difficult to unlock their MetroPCS iPhone and resort to buying a new phone altogether to use it with another service provider. In this article, you will learn how to use the MetroPCS unlock phones feature with three different methods. So, let’s get started!

### 1\. Calling MetroPCS to Unlock Phones

The first and most straightforward method to carrier unlocks MetroPCS phone is to call the company. But before you do that, make sure whether your phone has GSM/LTE or CDMA technology. Check for the small slot on the side of your phone to see whether there’s a SIM.

If your phone does not have a SIM, it uses CDMA technology. You will have to call your new carrier company and request them to unlock your phone in such a case. However, if you find a SIM card, your phone works on GSM or LTE and can easily be unlocked by contacting MetroPCS customer care.

Here’s how to do that:

**Step 1**

Call 1-888-863-8768 to reach the MetroPCS customer service, and request a MetroPCS network unlock code.

**Step 2**

They might ask you to provide your phone number, name on the MetroPCS account, email address, and PIN. Therefore, keep this information at hand.

**Step 3**

They will send you a confirmation email within 2 to 3 business days, containing the MetroPCS unlock code and instructions on how to use it.

**Step 4**

The instructions involve turning off your phone, inserting the SIM card of the new carrier, and entering the provided code when prompted. And that’s how you unlock your MetroPCS phone for free via the official method.

The downside of this method is again the time consumption. You have to call and wait for your turn, answer a bunch of questions, and wait for several days before receiving a confirmation email. If you want to save all this time, you can unlock iPhone MetroPCS for free using a more time-efficient method, i.e., using an unlock tool like [Dr.Fone – Sim Unlock](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/iphone-unlock/).

### 2\. Unlock iPhone MetroPCS with an Unlock Tool

If you’re in a hurry and can’t spare 2 to 3 days to unlock your phone, you can use an unlock tool like Dr.Fone that helps unlock your Apple iPhone SE in just 5 minutes. It is reliable, foolproof, and secure. And the best part about Dr.Fone is that it supports all iPhone models from XR to iPhone 13, so if you meet the “Sim not supported” issue on your MetroPCS iPhone 8 or 7, no worry at all. This high-success rate professional tool unlocks your phone without the fear of losing any data.

Then there’s a third way that involves using a device unlock app.

While all 3 ways are easy, they require time and patience, except for Dr.Fone, which lets you unlock your Apple iPhone SE within 5 minutes. So, save your time and money and go for a reliable and foolproof way to unlock iPhone MetroPCS, the Dr.Fone way!

## Contact Your Carrier to Unlock iPhone 8/8Plus

If your Apple iPhone SE is locked, then it must be for some reason. The carrier who has set this lock can provide the best solution.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### Check the unlock prerequisites

To check the unlock prerequisites, Go to Settings > General > About to find out if your Apple iPhone SE is locked. Your Apple iPhone SE is unlocked if it says "No SIM restrictions" next to "Carrier Lock."

### Contact the carrier for the unlock code

Large cell phone companies often offer discounted devices to customers who sign an agreement for set time frames. Because of this, the Apple iPhone SE device comes with a controller lock so customers can only use it on their network. If your contract with the company is over, you can get out of it for free. Before you can unlock your Apple iPhone SE, you must meet the following requirements:

First of all, it must be a legal device. It means the Apple iPhone SE device is not reported as lost, stolen. Then your bank account must not have any financial debts. If you signed a contract in exchange for a lower up-front cost, you'd have to wait until your contract ends (usually 24 months) or pay the remaining balance if you purchased your phone on a payment schedule.
