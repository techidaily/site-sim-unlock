If you already know that your carrier is AT&T, you can contact them directly and get your Apple iPhone 8 Plus unlocked as follows:

#### **Step 1:** Go to their Site and Contact them

## How To Unlock Apple iPhone 8 Plus: Official Method to Unlock Your Apple iPhone 8 Plus

Restriction on the use of a SIM card by a carrier often creates a lot of problems. The barrier that you can't use another company's SIM somehow makes you feel like you're not the only owner of the phone. But you don't need to worry anymore because you are in the right place to know about the way use to unlock your Apple iPhone 8 Plus.

This article is about the official way to get your Apple iPhone 8 Plus unlocked from your carrier. But we also have a solution if you want to avoid contacting your carrier.

## Part 1: What Should You Do Before Apple iPhone 8 Plus SIM Unlock?

Before unlocking your Apple iPhone 8 Plus from the carrier, you should fulfill the following criteria.

### 1\. No Due Before Unlocking

When iPhone users sign contracts with a giant cell phone company for a certain amount of time, they often get a discount on a device. Because of this, the Apple iPhone 8 Plus device comes with a controller lock so customers can only use it on their network.

So, if you've paid off your contract or bought your Apple iPhone 8 Plus without a subsidy, it's perfectly legal to unlock it. But if you're still paying off your contract, you still need to own the Apple iPhone 8 Plus fully, so you should confirm with your carrier before unlocking it.

### 2\. You Should Buy It for More Than the Time Limit in the Contract

You can leave without paying anything if your agreement with the company is over. If you signed a contract in exchange for a lower price upfront, you would have to wait until your contract ended (usually 24 months) or pay the remaining balance if you bought your phone on a payment plan.

### Examples: Requirements of Sim Unlock of T-Mobile/EE/AT&T

T-Mobile, EE, and AT&T have common requirements before you can unlock your Apple iPhone 8 Plus.

- If you meet the above requirements, you can call customer service at 611 from the Apple iPhone 8 Plus device you want to unlock to unlock an iPhone 11 or 12 that is locked to a T-Mobile network.
