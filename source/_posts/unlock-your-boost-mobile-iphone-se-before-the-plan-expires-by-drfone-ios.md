If you are currently not a Boost customer and have been a customer earlier or have never been a customer and have purchased from a previous owner, you can still get your phone unlocked, though the process becomes a little complicated and the following are the requirements.

- You would need a Boost mobile number or an account number that was last associated with the Apple iPhone SE device.
- In case you do not have the number, then you will have to get in touch with the previous owner and get these details.

And in case you do not meet either of the above two situations, **Boost mobile carrier unlock** on your device cannot be done and you will first need to use the Boost network for the required time and get yourself eligible for the unlocking process.

_**Tip**: Another important point to consider before buying a device from a third party is to check with the Boost Mobile if the phone is unlocked or if it is eligible. In case you come to know that your device cannot be unlocked, you will not have to worry about the eligibility criteria or requirements._

## All About Apple iPhone SE Unlock Chip You Need to Know

Have you purchased an iPhone from a cellular company or through a contract? So, it's clear that you aren't free to use your Apple iPhone SE.

## What is iPhone Unlock Chip?

iPhone unlock chip is a microchip that unlocks the iPhones and makes them able to run on any network worldwide. When you buy an iPhone, it is either locked (unable to accept carrier) or factory unlocked (can accept any carrier). These unlock chips can bypass the carrier locks in iPhones and enable locked devices to work with any SIM.

An unlock chip is an easy and cheap way to get an Apple iPhone SE to work with a different SIM card Using iPhone unlock chip enables the locked Apple iPhone SE to call and send SMS using the local network sim card, just like a factory-unlocked phone does.

### How does it work

An unlock chip is typically a slim SIM card, a memory interface chip that can be put in along with your regular SIM card. It goes on top of your Apple iPhone SE's normal SIM card and removes the network lock so you can use any sim.

Putting an iPhone Unlock Chip around your regular SIM card changes how your Apple iPhone SE and SIM card talk to each other. So, the unlock chip's controller fakes the IMSI number, which allows you to use other mobile networks.

Unfortunately, many iPhone unlock chips require a jailbroken iPhone before being used. Even if your Apple iPhone SE isn't jailbroken, you can still use an iPhone unlock chip to access some of its features.
