## Ways To Find Unlocking Codes For Tecno Pop 8 Phones

When you have a locked device, it is pretty much impossible to move from one network to another. This would cause problems if for instance you wanted to travel outside the country and want to switch to that country's carrier for the duration of your stay. Or maybe you just want to switch carriers because you don't like your current provider.

Whatever the reason, you should be able to unlock your device easily. But this has often proven difficult because of the fact that you need unlock codes. The problem is that many sites promise free unlocking codes for your device and many turn out to be fraudulent sites that use the word "free" in their advertising but actually require you to pay for the service. If you have been unsuccessfully searching for free unlocking codes for your device, look no further. This article compiles three of the best for Android and iPhone.

## Part 1: 3 Ways to Find Unlocking Codes for Android Devices

### 1\. Unlock it Free

Website URL: [http://www.unlockitfree.com/](http://www.unlockitfree.com/)

This site does exactly what it says it will do- unlock your device for free. It offer a great unlocking service especially for Nokia devices. It is also very easy to use. All you have to do once you're on the homepage is enter the model number of your device (this is typically the number or code that follows the name of the Tecno Pop 8 device) and then click "find"

![ways to find unlocking codes-Unlock it Free](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2016/06/14670152348544.jpg)

In the next window, you will be required to enter your IMEI number, phone model, country and provider. You can get your IMEI number by dialling \*#06# on your device.

Once you have entered all the details correctly click "Generate" and the website will give you seven different codes to unlock your device.

![ways to find unlocking codes-click ](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2016/06/14670152532630.jpg)

Use the first one. If it fails to work, try the last code. 80% of people unlock their devices with either the first or the last code. Of this doesn't work either, try 2 more. But don't enter more than 4 codes as this will disable your device.

### 2\. Trycktill

Website URL: [http://www.trycktill.com/](http://www.trycktill.com/)

### Method 1: Contacting Your Carrier’s Customer Service

The most straightforward approach is contacting your mobile carrier’s customer service department directly. Their representatives are trained to assist in such situations and can verify your identity before providing the PUK code. Be prepared to answer security questions and provide relevant account details to ensure a smooth process.

![customer service](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/02/unlock-sim-without-puk-code-02.jpg)

- **Verify your identity.**Answer the security questions or provide the requested account details to confirm that you’re the authorized user.
- **Receive your PUK code/new SIM card.** Once verified, the representative will provide you with your PUK code. Be sure to write it down in a secure location for future reference. They might offer you a replaced SIM card if no PUK codes exist.
- **Unlock your SIM card.**Enter the PUK code on your phone following the specific instructions provided by your carrier. This typically involves entering the PUK code followed by a new PIN.
