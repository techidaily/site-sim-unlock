## Part 1: What Should You Do Before Apple iPhone 11 SIM Unlock?

Before unlocking your Apple iPhone 11 from the carrier, you should fulfill the following criteria.

<a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2087407/7443" target="_top" id="2087407"><img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2087407" border="0" alt="" width="600" height="500"/></a><img height="0" width="0" src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2087407/7443" style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0" />
<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### 1\. No Due Before Unlocking

When iPhone users sign contracts with a giant cell phone company for a certain amount of time, they often get a discount on a device. Because of this, the Apple iPhone 11 device comes with a controller lock so customers can only use it on their network.

So, if you've paid off your contract or bought your Apple iPhone 11 without a subsidy, it's perfectly legal to unlock it. But if you're still paying off your contract, you still need to own the Apple iPhone 11 fully, so you should confirm with your carrier before unlocking it.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### 2\. You Should Buy It for More Than the Time Limit in the Contract

You can leave without paying anything if your agreement with the company is over. If you signed a contract in exchange for a lower price upfront, you would have to wait until your contract ended (usually 24 months) or pay the remaining balance if you bought your phone on a payment plan.

Here’s an overview of the options available:

Cricket Network Unlock Code Free From Cricket Wireless

It is the most straightforward approach, but it comes with some restrictions. You must meet Cricket’s unlock policy requirements. If you fulfill these conditions, you can request a **Cricket unlock code for free** online.

Early Unlocking for Military Personnel

Good news if you’re in the military. You can ask their customer support to unlock your Apple iPhone 11, even if you haven’t used the service for six months. Having a **Cricket device unlocked** earlier is a way to help you stay connected during deployments.

Third-Party iPhone Unlocking Tools

Not all devices can be unlocked by Cricket if you don’t qualify for their requirements. However, paid online services and third-party apps can open up your options. These tools can help you use your phone on any compatible carrier, even if you don’t meet **Cricket device unlock** requirements.

While this option can be faster, choosing a reputable service provider and understanding the associated risks is crucial. Ensure it is legal in your region and won’t harm your phone’s functionality.

Ready to **unlock Cricket iPhone**? But wait, are you sure you meet the eligibility criteria? Let’s find out in the next section.

## Part 2: What Are the Requirements To Unlock Cricket iPhone?

You might be here because you are considering using your Cricket iPhone on other carriers. Unlocking allows switching wireless networks or increasing resale value. But before that, you need to meet the following requirements to **unlock Cricket iPhones** using the official method:

- Active service: The Cricket iPhone must have been active with paid service for at least six months.
- Device Lock: The device must be locked to the Cricket network. You can check the lock status by contacting Cricket customer support.
- Device Status: Before you get the **Cricket network unlock code free**of charge, your phone cannot be reported lost, stolen, or involved in fraudulent activity.
- Account Status: Your Cricket account must be in good standing, meaning no outstanding balances or unpaid bills.

Exceptions for Active Military Personnel

If you’re in the military and can’t meet the six-month service rule, you can ask for a quick **device unlock from Cricket**. But there are still other requirements to fulfill, and you must show Cricket proof of your deployment. This proof can be military orders, deployment papers, or a letter from your commanding officer.

Eligibility checked? Great! Now, let’s continue and explore the different ways you can **unlock a Cricket iPhone**. We’ll start with online methods and then cover a section for military personnel.

If you think your Cricket phone meets the criteria, follow these steps below to receive a **Cricket network unlock code freely** available online.
