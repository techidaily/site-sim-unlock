It is important to note that not all phones are SIM locked. You can find out if yours is by checking the Samsung Galaxy S24+ device's documentation. If you see the words "unlocked" on the initial receipt then you know that the Samsung Galaxy S24+ device is not SIM locked.

### Q1: What is an Android Lock?

An Android lock is a security feature that allows you to protect your device from unauthorized access. There are various types of Android locks, such as pattern locks, PIN locks, and fingerprint locks.

### Q2: Why Would I Want to Remove an Android lock?

There are several reasons why you might want to remove an Android lock. For example, you may have forgotten your lock screen pattern, PIN, or password. Alternatively, you may have purchased a second-hand device with a locked screen and want to gain access to it.

### Q3: What is the Master Unlock Code for a Samsung?

A Master PIN code, also known as a [Samsung Unlock Code](https://drfone.wondershare.com/unlock/samsung-unlock-codes.html), is a unique numeric code that can be used to unlock a Samsung device. This code is typically provided by the manufacturer or carrier and is used to remove any restrictions or limitations on the Samsung Galaxy S24+ device. It allows the user to use the Samsung Galaxy S24+ device with any carrier or SIM card, giving them more flexibility and freedom. It is important to note that the Master PIN code is different from the Samsung Galaxy S24+ device's regular PIN or password, and it should be kept confidential to prevent unauthorized access to the Samsung Galaxy S24+ device.

### Q4: Can I Remove an Android Lock Without Losing My Data?

If your device is Samsung or LG, Dr.Fone could help unlock your screen without erasing your data. Please check if your tool model is involved in the [device information list](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/unlock-android-screen/).
