Most carriers need active accounts for specific days before unlocking devices. Sprint has 50 days, T-Mobile 40, and AT&T 60. Verizon has no minimum period if you need to factory reset your phone to use the new network and back up beforehand.

### Insert a new SIM card to unlock your device

- Turn off your device.
- SIM card out.

## How to Check iPhone SIM Lock Status?

Before you try any other solution, you should check the nature of the Lock on your Apple iPhone X. Once you know the problem, you can move on to the right solution.

### 1\. Contact your service provider

Well, this is not a quick solution. You must contact your service provider to determine the sim lock status. Generally, you have to submit a request to the company and the IMEI number. The company will later inform you about the Sim lock status of your Apple iPhone X through E-mail or any other channel.

### 2\. Check it via "Carrier Lock" in "Settings."

Navigate to Settings > General > About.

Apple has added a new Network Provider Lock section to iOS 14 that immediately tells you the Apple iPhone X device's status.

Scroll down to find the section called "Network Provider Lock." If the Apple iPhone X is unlocked, it should say "No SIM restrictions" on the screen. If you see something different, it means the Apple iPhone X is locked.
