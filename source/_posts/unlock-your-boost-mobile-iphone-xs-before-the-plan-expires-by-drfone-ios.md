## Unlock Your Boost Mobile Apple iPhone XS Before the Plan Expires

If you are using your Apple iPhone XS with the Boost mobile network, then it means that your device is locked with the carrier and can only work with the ones supported by Boost. So, now if you are willing to move to another carrier for a better installment plan, or any other reason, the need for **Boost mobile unlock** will arise.

To unlock your device, you have two options, you can either use the **free Boost mobile unlock code** that is the official way of unlocking the Apple iPhone XS device (though it requires several prerequisites), or can opt for a third-party tool.

In the following parts of the topic, we will take you through all the details needed for Boost mobile device unlock.

## Part1: What Will Get After unlocking Boost Mobile?

Before you go for the **Boost mobile device unlock**, the very first thing to know is why do you want to unlock your device and what will be its benefits. Some of the major scenarios that you can achieve by unlocking your Apple iPhone XS are listed below.

### Switching to other networks offering more lucrative and suitable deals

There is quite a possibility that during your Boost plan you may find a deal or an offer by another carrier that is more lucrative, pocket friendly, and meet all your requirements. In such situations, you would want to unlock your device and shift to another carrier to avail of the deal.

### Using a second-hand device having a locked carrier

If you have bought a second-hand device having the locked carrier or paid monthly contracts, you would need to first need to unlock the Apple iPhone XS device to use it. It might happen that the original owner of the phone might have a locked carrier plan on their device which they missed ending up before selling the phone. So, as a new buyer, you would need to unlock it to enable it with your choice of the carrier.

### An unlocked phone will fetch you better prices while selling it

If you are planning to sell your phone, then it is advisable to unlock its carrier for bargaining a better deal and pricing. A buyer would always want an iPhone where they can use their choice of network and carrier and thus if you unlock your phone, you can fetch better prices in comparison to the locked phone.

### Allows connecting to network overseas without activating roaming

If you use a locked carrier on your phone, you would need to activate roaming while traveling overseas and this would be quite pricey. Here unlocking proves to be quite beneficial as with the unlocked device, you can opt for the overseas carrier network and thus there will be no need for any roaming activation.

Step 1. Call the Boost customer service contact number.

Step 2. You will be provided with a **Boost mobile network unlock code**.

Step 3. You need to input the provided code and your device will be unlocked.

Note: For the BoostUP! For installment plan holders, the **Boost Mobile unlock Sim card** process will be done in a day while for the others it might take around 2 days.

A few points that need to be taken care of during the unlocking process are as follows:

- Ensure that your SIM card is in your phone else if you replace or remove the SIM card, your unlocking request might fail.
- Also, make sure that your device during the phase is turned on and is also connected with the Boost Mobile Network or to a WiFi network.

Unlocking phones for the Non-Boost Customers

If you are currently not a Boost customer and have been a customer earlier or have never been a customer and have purchased from a previous owner, you can still get your phone unlocked, though the process becomes a little complicated and the following are the requirements.

- You would need a Boost mobile number or an account number that was last associated with the Apple iPhone XS device.
- In case you do not have the number, then you will have to get in touch with the previous owner and get these details.

And in case you do not meet either of the above two situations, **Boost mobile carrier unlock** on your device cannot be done and you will first need to use the Boost network for the required time and get yourself eligible for the unlocking process.

_**Tip**: Another important point to consider before buying a device from a third party is to check with the Boost Mobile if the phone is unlocked or if it is eligible. In case you come to know that your device cannot be unlocked, you will not have to worry about the eligibility criteria or requirements._

This can be a problem when you want to change carriers. Some iPhones are generally easier to unlock than others, and the easiest way to unlock any iPhone is usually to use a paid online service. The issue is that these services can be very expensive.

##  Part 1: How to SIM Unlock Your Apple iPhone XS?

There are several ways to unlock your device. Let's look at a few of them.

### 1\. Contact your Carrier and Have them unlock the Apple iPhone XS device for you

This is probably the safest way to do it. If you have already completed payments on your Apple iPhone XS or you bought it outright, you can ask your carrier for the [sim network unlock pin](https://drfone.wondershare.com/unlock/unlock-samsung-sim-network-unlock-pin.html) to unlock your device. Depending on your carrier, you may have to pay for this service, and it also does take up to 7 days, sometimes more for them to get back to you.

### 2\. Software Unlocking

This is where you download a piece of [sim network unlock pin software](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/unlock-android-screen/) on to your device. This software makes changes to the Apple iPhone XS device, allowing you to make calls from any carrier. While this may sound straight-forward and easy, except it is highly risky and will not work for iPhone 4 and later models.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### 3\. Hardware Unlocking

This is where you alter the hardware of the Apple iPhone XS device to create an alternate path to deliver calls. Although this can be done, it also alters your device irreparably and probably also voids your warranty. Not to mention, you may pay more than $200 to have the Apple iPhone XS device unlocked in this way.

### 4\. IMEI unlocking

This is the best way to unlock your device and by far the easiest. This method uses your device's IMEI number to access the IMEI database and change the status of the Apple iPhone XS from locked to unlocked. There are very many services that you can use to IMEI unlock your device, and most of them will offer the service for a fee. But this is a great solution because there is no software to download, and you don't mess with the hardware in any way.
