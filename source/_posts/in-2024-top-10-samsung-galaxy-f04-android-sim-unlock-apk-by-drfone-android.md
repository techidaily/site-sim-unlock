- Provide easily available basic information to get your unlocking code.

**Cons**

- Requires an internet connection to function (web-based tool).
- The name suggests the tool is useful only for Nokia mobiles.

**Review**

The NokiaFree Android SIM unlock code generator is getting better all the time. You now have access to a tool that is easy to use, and quickly unlocks restrictions on a wide range of mobiles, and anywhere in the world. An added bonus is it comes to you totally free of cost. The download takes very little time, and this Android unlock code generator does not interfere with other functions.

### Tool 2: WorldUnlock Codes Calculator

As the name suggests, the [WorldUnlock Codes Calculator](https://www.allmobitools.com/worldunlock-codes-calculator-latest/) can unlock your phone in any location with just a few clicks. It's easy to find a reliable code generator, but you'd have to pay for receiving a code in variable amounts. In other words, there are no fixed charges to locate your phone unlock code from a dealer. However, this software is totally free and requires only basic details to provide the unlock code.
