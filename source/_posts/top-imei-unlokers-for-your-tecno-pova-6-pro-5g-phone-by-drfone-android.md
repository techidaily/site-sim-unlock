3. Once your customer service representative has determined if you have met all their requirements, they should give you the SIM network unlock PIN Tecno Pova 6 Pro 5G. Again, depending on your carrier, they might either give you the code over the phone, through email or via SMS. If you have the choice, always opt for email or SMS so that you are able to jot down the right number.
4. Once you have gotten the code, insert the new SIM card (from your new carrier). You will receive a prompt to enter your code. Make sure that you key in the right code---entering the wrong code will cause your phone to be locked (possibly forever).

## Part 5: The benefits of an unlocked Tecno Pova 6 Pro 5G

If you now know how to unlock Tecno Pova 6 Pro 5G but still do not know its advantages, we are here to help.

As indicated in the introduction, unlocked phone users can freely choose the plans they subscribed to---on any carriers, in any country. Therefore, if you travel frequently around the world, having an unlocked Tecno Pova 6 Pro 5G would be beneficial. Using a local SIM card is much cheaper than paying for exorbitant roaming charges.

You can also benefit from an unlocked Tecno Pova 6 Pro 5G if you are the kind of person who likes to take advantage of current offers provided by your local carriers. Prepaid plans are always changing in terms of offering so having the flexibility of changing carriers and prepaid plans can help you save money in the long run.

## Part 6: The downside of an unlocked Tecno Pova 6 Pro 5G

Are you thinking "Well, why can't I just buy an unlocked Tecno Pova 6 Pro 5G in the first place?" right about now? Well, you can but think of the amount of money it will cost you.

For example, in Australia, an unlocked Tecno Pova 6 Pro 5G will cost around $499 from any Tecno outlet but $0 for the Tecno Pova 6 Pro 5G device when you pair it with a 24-month postpaid plan. While this may look attractive now, you may be paying more for a locked Tecno Pova 6 Pro 5G in the long run.
