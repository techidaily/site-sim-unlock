Remember, each carrier has its policies and procedures regarding unlocking. Consult your carrier’s official website or contact customer support for specific instructions and eligibility requirements.

## Part 5: The benefits of an unlocked Vivo X Flip

If you now know how to unlock Vivo X Flip but still do not know its advantages, we are here to help.

As indicated in the introduction, unlocked phone users can freely choose the plans they subscribed to---on any carriers, in any country. Therefore, if you travel frequently around the world, having an unlocked Vivo X Flip would be beneficial. Using a local SIM card is much cheaper than paying for exorbitant roaming charges.

You can also benefit from an unlocked Vivo X Flip if you are the kind of person who likes to take advantage of current offers provided by your local carriers. Prepaid plans are always changing in terms of offering so having the flexibility of changing carriers and prepaid plans can help you save money in the long run.

## Part 6: The downside of an unlocked Vivo X Flip

Are you thinking "Well, why can't I just buy an unlocked Vivo X Flip in the first place?" right about now? Well, you can but think of the amount of money it will cost you.

For example, in Australia, an unlocked Vivo X Flip will cost around $499 from any Vivo outlet but $0 for the Vivo X Flip device when you pair it with a 24-month postpaid plan. While this may look attractive now, you may be paying more for a locked Vivo X Flip in the long run.

## Conclusion

Now that you know the three ways of unlocking your Vivo X Flip, all you need to do is find one that is most compatible with you. Just remember to think of everything through and carefully. Most importantly, if you have a locked device, always seek advice from your carrier to see if this is possible.
