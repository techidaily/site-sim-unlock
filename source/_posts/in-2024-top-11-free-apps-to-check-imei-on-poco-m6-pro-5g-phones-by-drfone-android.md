There are lots of websites that allow you to easily check your IMEI but in this world where we use our mobile devices more, most of us want the convenience of being able to perform this task on our devices.

For this reason, we saw it fit to compile a list of the best Android and iOS apps that allow you to easily do an IMEI check. Those apps are listed below.

### 1\. IMEI info

![imei info](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/05/imei-info.jpg)

The site [IMEI info](https://www.imei.info/) does just what the name suggest. It allows you to enter your IMEI (International Mobile Equipment Identity) number and immediately get information about your device. This unique 15-digit number is used to identify and track mobile devices, as well as to provide information about the Poco M6 Pro 5G device's brand, model, specifications, and other details.

It is easy to use and a great solution if you are just looking for a simple solution to find more information about your device using your IMEI number. Users can enter their device's IMEI number on the website to check its status, verify its authenticity, and access other useful information. This can be helpful in situations such as purchasing a used device or finding lost or stolen devices.

I highly recommend using [Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock (iOS)](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/iphone-unlock/) to remove SIM lock if you have the need. This software is user-friendly, effective, and reliable, ensuring that your device is unlocked without any issues._
