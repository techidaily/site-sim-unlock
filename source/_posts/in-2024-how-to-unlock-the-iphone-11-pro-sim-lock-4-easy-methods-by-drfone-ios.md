## What are the prerequisites for an Apple iPhone 11 Pro SIM lock?

(Verizon/AT&T/T-Mobile as example)

### How to unlock the Apple iPhone 11 Pro locked by Verizon

To prevent theft and other types of fraud, Verizon locks new devices to only work on the Verizon network. The company has different rules for unlocking prepaid and post-pay devices, as well as special rules for people in the military who are distributed.

"Unlocking" a device means turning off Software that would stop a customer from trying to use a device made for one carrier's network on another carrier's network. Due to different technologies, a Verizon Wireless device that has been unlocked may only work partially on another carrier's network.

![verizon](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/12/unlock-iphone-se-4.jpg)

**Verizon's Policy for unlocking Post-pay devices**

If you buy a phone from Verizon, it will be locked for 60 days after you buy it. If you buy a device from one of their authorized retailers, it will be locked for 60 days after it is activated.

After 60 days, the lock will be taken off itself unless the Apple iPhone 11 Pro device is found to be stolen or was bought through fraud. After 60 days, their phones are never locked again.

**Unlocking Verizon's Prepaid Device**

After activation, devices you buy from Verizon and some devices you buy from one of their authorized retailers are locked for 60 days. After 60 days, the lock will be taken off itself unless the Apple iPhone 11 Pro device is found to be stolen or was bought through fraud. After the first 60 days, their phones are locked, but after that, they never lock them again.

**Military Personnel Placement Unlocking Policy**

If you are in the military and a Verizon Wireless customer, in case, you get orders to move outside of the Verizon Coverage Area. The company will unlock your device and stop your service if you ask, even if it has only been 60 days since you bought it.

### How to unlock the Apple iPhone 11 Pro locked by AT&T

First, you should know that AT&T customers can only unlock a certain number of devices yearly. If a customer's account is in good shape, they can unlock up to five devices per account per year. You can find out how to unlock an AT&T device and if you meet the requirements on the AT&T support page.

### Contact your carrier to unlock it with the IMEI code

When a customer deals an agreement with a large cell phone company for a certain amount of time, they usually get a discount on a device. Because of this, the Apple iPhone 11 Pro device has a controller lock, so customers can only use it on their network. You can leave without paying anything if your contract with the company is over. Before you can unlock your Apple iPhone 11 Pro, you have to do the following:

First, it has to be legal. It means the Apple iPhone 11 Pro device has not been reported as lost, stolen, or linked to a crime.

Then your bank account shouldn't have any debts. If you signed a contract in exchange for a lower price upfront, you would have to wait until your contract was up (usually 24 months) or pay the remaining balance if you bought your phone on a payment plan. Each company has its way of unlocking.

With that your Apple iPhone 11 Pro is now completely unlock activated! You're free to use it as you please now.

In this article we've explained how to unlock T Mobile Apple iPhone 11 Pro using DoctorSIM - SIM Unlock Service, and how to unlock T Mobile iPhone 5s using the T Mobile carrier itself. While both of them are perfectly legitimate means of unlocking your Apple iPhone 11 Pros, I personally lean more towards the DoctorSIM solution as they don't have any pesky eligibility criteria, nor do they make you wait long. They are a 100% solution, especially considering they're a third-party tool which makes them less biased as they don't have an incentive to keep you from unlocking. Well, we hope this helped and hopefully now you have a T Mobile unlock iPhone!

## The Ultimate Guide to Unlocking Your Apple iPhone 11 Pro on MetroPCS

If you own an iPhone that is MetroPCS-branded, the carrier will probably lock it, making it impossible to use a SIM from another carrier on the Apple iPhone 11 Pro device. Therefore, you will have to unlock iPhone MetroPCS for this purpose.

Many people find it difficult to unlock their MetroPCS iPhone and resort to buying a new phone altogether to use it with another service provider. In this article, you will learn how to use the MetroPCS unlock phones feature with three different methods. So, let’s get started!

### 1\. Calling MetroPCS to Unlock Phones

The first and most straightforward method to carrier unlocks MetroPCS phone is to call the company. But before you do that, make sure whether your phone has GSM/LTE or CDMA technology. Check for the small slot on the side of your phone to see whether there’s a SIM.

If your phone does not have a SIM, it uses CDMA technology. You will have to call your new carrier company and request them to unlock your phone in such a case. However, if you find a SIM card, your phone works on GSM or LTE and can easily be unlocked by contacting MetroPCS customer care.

Here’s how to do that:

**Step 1**

Call 1-888-863-8768 to reach the MetroPCS customer service, and request a MetroPCS network unlock code.

**Step 2**

They might ask you to provide your phone number, name on the MetroPCS account, email address, and PIN. Therefore, keep this information at hand.

**Step 3**

They will send you a confirmation email within 2 to 3 business days, containing the MetroPCS unlock code and instructions on how to use it.

**Step 4**

The instructions involve turning off your phone, inserting the SIM card of the new carrier, and entering the provided code when prompted. And that’s how you unlock your MetroPCS phone for free via the official method.

The downside of this method is again the time consumption. You have to call and wait for your turn, answer a bunch of questions, and wait for several days before receiving a confirmation email. If you want to save all this time, you can unlock iPhone MetroPCS for free using a more time-efficient method, i.e., using an unlock tool like [Dr.Fone – Sim Unlock](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/iphone-unlock/).

### Q. How can I tell if My Apple iPhone 11 Pro is eligible to unlock if it's MetroPCS?

MetroPCS has some eligibility requirements to unlock your Apple iPhone 11 Pro. The criteria to be eligible are:

1. You must have purchased your Apple iPhone 11 Pro from MetroPCS.
2. The device to be unlocked must not be stolen, lost, or blocked.
3. The device must be activated for 180 days to be eligible to be unlocked.

If you fulfill these requirements, your phone is eligible to be unlocked.

### Q. What do I do if I unlock My Apple iPhone 11 Pro and now my SIM card doesn't work?

If you get this error, it means that the SIM card you have inserted into the Apple iPhone 11 Pro device is not supported by the activation policy assigned by the activation server. To solve this issue, you need a SIM from a supported carrier and request them to unlock the iPhone.

### Conclusion

If you own an iPhone locked by MetroPCS but want to use another carrier’s SIM on it, you will have to unlock your phone first. There are several ways to do so. You can either do it the official way by calling MetroPCS and requesting a MetroPCS unlock code, or you can do it easily by using a third-party unlock tool like Dr.Fone. Then there’s a third way that involves using a device unlock app.

While all 3 ways are easy, they require time and patience, except for Dr.Fone, which lets you unlock your Apple iPhone 11 Pro within 5 minutes. So, save your time and money and go for a reliable and foolproof way to unlock iPhone MetroPCS, the Dr.Fone way!
