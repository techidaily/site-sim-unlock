It is really irritating when you realize that Xiaomi Redmi A2+ phone is locked to a specific network. When you travel to another country, your phone becomes useless – you can’t use a foreign sim card. If your Xiaomi Redmi A2+ phone is locked to a network and want to switch to a different provider, you are out of luck.

Thankfully, there are a few easy ways to unlock your Xiaomi Redmi A2+ phone with free Xiaomi unlock codes. In this article, we review and explain 4 different websites that offer free unlock codes for Xiaomi Redmi A2+ phones. Read ahead and learn how you can use four Xiaomi unlock code websites.

## Part 1: SIM Unlock Service

SIM Unlock Service is one of the best and trust-worthy SIM unlock code generators available on the market. This is not a free option, but it is so effective that many users find it is worth the price. It saves you so much hassle that it is worth the small upfront fee. Doctorsim will permanently unlock your phone, enabling you to use your phone on all carriers around the world. Most importantly, using DoctorSim will not void your warranty.

### How to use DoctorSim SIM Unlock Service to unlock Xiaomi Redmi A2+ phones?

Step 1. Go to [DoctorSim's official website](https://www.doctorsim.com/libtrkafl.html?pc=43d47c30d945bcbd7d9527f4049f649a&refe=https://www.doctorsim.com/us-en/?scp&euro), so you know that you can trust it. Click on the ‘Select Your Xiaomi Redmi A2+’ button, and then select Xiaomi from the list of brands.

Once your order is processed, the system will send you your personalized unlock code and unlocking instructions. You can then follow the instructions to unlock your Xiaomi Redmi A2+ phone. Easy!

## Part 2: Unlockitfree.com for free Xiaomi unlock codes
