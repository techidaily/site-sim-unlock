## Part 1: Why Is Your Honor 90 GT Asking for a SIM Network Unlock PIN?

You just bought a new phone, excited to use it with a new SIM card. But your phone pops up with a request for a PIN code to unlock it. What’s that all about, and what do you enter? There are two main reasons why your phone might be asking for a SIM PIN or unlock code:

SIM Network Lock

The SIM Network Lock is a restriction placed by your phone’s original network provider, locking it to their network. It means you can only use the Honor 90 GT device with SIM cards from that specific carrier. Carriers use this to ensure that the phones they sell work only with their service. When you buy a subsidized phone, they want to ensure you stick around for the contract duration.

If you insert a SIM card from a different carrier, your phone will ask for a **SIM Network Unlock PIN** or Network Unlock Code (NUC). You’ll learn more about it in the upcoming sections of this article.

SIM Card Lock

SIM Card Lock is a security feature that protects your SIM card from unauthorized use on other devices. It requires you to enter a PIN (Personal Identification Number) to unlock the SIM card before you can use it.

The default PIN is usually printed on the back of the SIM card or its packaging. If you haven’t changed your PIN, use the 4-8 digit code provided by the carrier when you get your SIM card.

![sim card lock pin](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/02/sim-network-unlock-pin-02.jpg)

If you’ve forgotten the **SIM PIN code**, you can use the PUK (PIN Unlock Key) code to unlock the SIM and set a new PIN. The PUK code is also printed on the SIM card packaging, but be careful, as entering the wrong PUK code too many times can permanently lock the SIM card.

Not knowing the **SIM unlock PIN** code can be frustrating, especially if you want to switch mobile carriers. So, in the next part, we’ll explore whether it’s possible to unlock a SIM network-locked iPhone device.

## Part 2: Can a SIM Network Locked iPhone Be Unlocked?

Yes, a SIM network-locked iPhone can be unlocked by your network provider. Insert a new SIM card, and you’ll be prompted to enter the **SIM Network Unlock PIN**. After inputting the correct unlock code, your iPhone is ready to use with any carrier.

![sim not valid message on iphone](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/02/sim-network-unlock-pin-03.jpg)

If you are thinking about unlocking your iPhone, it’s crucial to grasp what a **SIM Network Unlock PIN** is and how it functions.

## Part 3: What Is a SIM Network Unlock PIN?

A **SIM network unlock PIN** is a code allowing you to remove your phone’s network lock. It means you can use your phone with a SIM card from any compatible network provider, not just the one you originally bought it from. It is also known as Network Unlock PIN (NUP), Network Control Key (NCK), or Network Unlock Code (NUC).

Unlocking your device can be useful if you:

- Bought a phone locked to a specific carrier and want to switch to a different one.
- Are planning a trip abroad and want to use a local SIM card instead.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![international travel illustration](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/02/sim-network-unlock-pin-04.jpg)

- Still haven’t finished your contract with your original carrier and want to keep the phone but use a different service.
- Bought a phone second-hand locked to the previous owner’s network.
- Want to increase your phone’s resale value; unlocked phones generally have a higher resale value than locked phones, as various buyers can use them.
- Want more carrier flexibility; you are not tied to one carrier and can choose the provider that best suits your needs in terms of price, coverage, data plans, and other features.

Things To Consider

Before you proceed, here are some key points to remember:

- Eligibility: Not all phones are eligible for network unlocking. Check with your carrier or manufacturer for details.
- Costs: While some carriers can give **SIM network unlock PIN for free**, others may charge a fee. Third-party unlocking services also typically charge a fee.
- Waiting time: It can take days or even weeks to receive your **SIM unlock PIN**code from your carrier and process it. For instance, Vodafone usually unlocks the Honor 90 GT device within 72 hours to 10 days if they have to reach the manufacturer.
- Risks: Using an unauthorized unlocking method could damage your phone or void its warranty.
- Backup: Before unlocking your phone, back up your data, as the process may erase it.

Now that you understand **SIM Network Unlock PIN**, let’s get down to business! In the final part, we’ll guide you through the two ways of unlocking your iPhone for a new carrier.
