All of these are ideal for helping you with IMEI checking. They can be great solutions and we hope that you are able to find the right one for your needs. Let us know how the one you pick works for you and if you encounter any problems while using any of the apps.

_**Tips:** If you have ever had your iPhone locked, you know how frustrating it can be. You need to get a new SIM card and pay the carrier a lot of money, but with [Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock (iOS)](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/iphone-unlock/) you can unlock your iPhone easily, quickly and safely for international use, and bypass the carrier SIM lock in many situations like "[SIM Not Support](https://drfone.wondershare.com/iphone-problems/iphone-sim-not-supported.html)", "SIM Not Valid", "SIM Locked" or "No Network Serves"._
