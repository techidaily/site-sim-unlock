### 4\. Check IMEI

Website URL: [http://www.imei.info/](http://www.imei.info/)

This one is another great site that will check Apple iPhone 8 IMEI quite easily. The setup of the site itself makes it very easy to check the Apple iPhone 8. The site does offer other services such as IMEI calculator and operator codes but it doesn't offer unlocking services. The reason why we think it is a great choice is simply because of how fast results came back. To use this service, all you need to do is enter the IMEI number and then click on "Check."

Wait a few seconds for the website to generate results.
