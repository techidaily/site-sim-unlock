It is important to note that not all phones are SIM locked. You can find out if yours is by checking the Realme 11 Pro+ device's documentation. If you see the words "unlocked" on the initial receipt then you know that the Realme 11 Pro+ device is not SIM locked.

For Smartphones that are not on contract, you have to wait 12 months from the date of purchase and ensure that your bill is paid before the carrier can give you the unlock code.

**_How to Unlock your Android Phone_**

To begin with, you need to confirm your IMEI number. Dial \*#06# on your device and the IMEI number will appear on the screen. Copy this number to a secure location or wrote it down somewhere.
