#### **Step 2:** Email confirmation

1\. You'll receive the unlock request number via email.

2\. You need to click on the provided link within 24 hours in order for your unlock request to be officially accepted.

#### **Step 3:** Response

1\. You should hear back from AT&T within 2 days.

2\. If your request has been successful, they'll send you further instructions about how to unlock your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max.

### Requirements

However, AT&T has the right to dismiss anyone's request based on several requirements and criteria, so your application may yet be either rejected or you may have to go through further steps. It is a good idea to go through their requirements before you fill their form.

1\. The obvious requirement is that your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max must be locked to AT&T, else you should go to the relevant carrier page.

2\. You iPhone couldn't have been reported as either lost or stolen.

3\. No record of it having been linked to any criminal or fraudulent activities.

4\. All termination fees have been paid in full, and all the other iPhone installment plans, etc, have been completed.

5\. After upgrading iPhone you must wait 14 days before you're eligible for unlock.

Finding out how to unlock AT&T iPhone can be harrowing if you don't know where to look, especially because performing the unlock can be so crucial for many people in order to access other carriers.

Both the options mentioned above offer a legitimate means by which you can AT&T unlock your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max, whether done without a SIM card or by contacting the AT&T carrier.

However, going by personal experience the DoctorSIM alternative offers a much smoother, efficient and quicker alternative to contacting the AT&T carriers. It is also more secure because if you are going via the carrier without a SIM card then you'll need to back up your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max, then delete and restore it as well (for security measures). This isn't just a time consuming process, but it can also prove to be risky. Furthermore, AT&T has a lot of checks and requisites in place which can keep your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max from being unlocked, and even if you do pass the requisites it's still a time-consuming process which may still be rejected as AT&T has final say. As such, going via DoctorSIM gives you complete agency and conveniently AT&T unlocks iPhone without any data loss, through a simple 3 step process.

### How To Request for Telstra Phone Unlock

To unlock your Telstra phone, follow the steps below using the said options. Both utilize Telstra’s official customer representative line, after all.

![my telstra app app store](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/02/how-to-unlock-telstra-02.jpg)

- **Step 1:** Find your IMEI number. This unique 17-digit code identifies your phone. Dial \*#06# on your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max, or locate it on the back of the phone (if applicable) or the original box.
- **Step 2:** Use the My Telstra app under the “Get Help” section, call 125 8887 from a Telstra phone, 13 22 00 from a non-Telstra phone, or +61 439 125 888 if you’re overseas.
- **Step 3:** A Telstra representative will guide you through the process, explain any applicable fees, and assist you with payment if you are still within the 2-year period.

Before proceeding, it’s important to back up your phone data, as unlocking might erase it. Once complete, your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max will be network-lock-free, ready to embrace the world beyond Telstra.

While this information is current, visiting Telstra’s website or contacting their customer service for the latest fee structure and any policy updates is advisable. Also, note that this method can **unlock Telstra phones** other than iPhones.

## Method 2: How To Unlock iPhones With a Third-Party Phone Tool \[Recommended\]

For those seeking a potentially faster route to **unlock Telstra iPhones** or those who wish to avoid opening fees, third-party phone unlocking tools like Wondershare Dr.Fone present an alternative option. However, it’s crucial to consider the potential trade-offs before venturing down this path.

Among Dr.Fone’s features lies the coveted “SIM Unlock” functionality. This tool aims to remove carrier-imposed restrictions, allowing your Telstra Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max to work with other compatible networks. While seemingly convenient, it’s essential to understand the nuances before proceeding.

Dr.Fone’s SIM Unlock can bypass the carrier lock on your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max, enabling it to operate with SIM cards from different networks.

### How Does Dr.Fone’s SIM Unlock Work?

The steps involved in using Dr.Fone’s SIM Unlock vary depending on your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max and iOS version.. Generally, the process involves connecting your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max to your computer, selecting the “SIM Unlock” function, and following the on-screen prompts. To be more specific, follow the steps below:

- **Step 1:** Download and install [Wondershare Dr.Fone](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/drfone-toolkit/) from the official website and launch it on your computer.


- **Step 2:** On the Dr.Fone homepage, go to **Toolbox > Screen Unlock > iOS**. Connect your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max with the appropriate cable, too.

![dr.fone homepage](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/drfone-home.png)

- **Step 3:** You’ll see several features on the Screen Unlock module. You can explore them, but for the purpose of this guide, click **Remove SIM Locked**.

![dr.fone screen unlock page](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/remove-iphone-sim-1.png)

- **Step 4:** Click **Start** when you see this page.
- **Step 5:** The program will detect your device details. Make sure that these are correct. Once done, click **Unlock Now**.

![dr.fone sim phone verify page](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/remove-iphone-sim-3.png)

- **Step 6:** Note that you’ll need a jailbroken Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max to **unlock Telstra phones**. Click **JailBreak Guide** or **Watch Video** to learn how.

![dr.fone sim jailbreak page](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/remove-iphone-sim-4.png)

- **Step 7:** You’ll see several instructions on the things you need to do before unlocking your device. Follow them and click **Continue**.

![dr.fone instructions sim operation](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/remove-iphone-sim-5.png)

- **Step 8:** Dr.Fone will prompt you once the process is complete. Click **Done** to conclude the unlocking method. Insert a new SIM to confirm if it was successful.

![dr.fone sim lock removal success](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/remove-iphone-sim-7.png)

**Disclaimer:** It’s vital to note that unlocking methods, particularly with third-party tools, may not always be successful, especially for newer iPhone models and iOS versions. Also, using third-party unlocking tools can void your phone’s warranty, leaving you responsible for any future repairs not covered by the manufacturer.

## Method 3: Using Online Unlockers To Unlock Telstra iPhones

While venturing into the online realm, you might encounter websites offering remote unlocking services for a fee. These services claim to **unlock your Telstra phone** quickly and conveniently, often without contacting the carrier. However, approaching this method requires extreme caution due to potential risks and legal implications.

Before diving in:

- **Understand the risks.**Online unlocking services operate in a gray area, potentially violating your carrier’s terms and conditions. This could lead to legal trouble or void your phone’s warranty.
- **Beware of scams.**Unfortunately, not all online unlocking services are legitimate. Many are scams designed to steal your money or personal information.
- **Do your research.**If you choose to proceed, thoroughly research the service provider. Read reviews from other users, check their track record, and ensure they have a good reputation.

These services typically require you to provide your phone’s IMEI number and pay a fee. They then claim to use various methods, often software or network vulnerabilities, to unlock your phone remotely. However, the success rate and security of these methods are highly questionable. Thus, relying on Dr.Fone as an alternative unlocking method is recommended.

## Conclusion

**Unlocking Telstra iPhones** gives you network flexibility, but navigating the process requires a measured approach. Remember, while Telstra’s official methods offer a guaranteed and secure path to freedom, third-party tools like Wondershare Dr.Fone present a potential avenue for those seeking alternative solutions.

After all, Wondershare Dr.Fone remains a valuable tool for your broader phone needs. From data recovery to system repair, its diverse functionalities can enhance your mobile experience in various ways. You can use it as an all-in-one application for all your needs, from network unlocking to system repair.
