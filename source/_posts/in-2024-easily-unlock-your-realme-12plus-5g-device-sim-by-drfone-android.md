## Part 5: The benefits of an unlocked Realme 12+ 5G

If you now know how to unlock Realme 12+ 5G but still do not know its advantages, we are here to help.

As indicated in the introduction, unlocked phone users can freely choose the plans they subscribed to---on any carriers, in any country. Therefore, if you travel frequently around the world, having an unlocked Realme 12+ 5G would be beneficial. Using a local SIM card is much cheaper than paying for exorbitant roaming charges.

You can also benefit from an unlocked Realme 12+ 5G if you are the kind of person who likes to take advantage of current offers provided by your local carriers. Prepaid plans are always changing in terms of offering so having the flexibility of changing carriers and prepaid plans can help you save money in the long run.

## Part 6: The downside of an unlocked Realme 12+ 5G

Are you thinking "Well, why can't I just buy an unlocked Realme 12+ 5G in the first place?" right about now? Well, you can but think of the amount of money it will cost you.

For example, in Australia, an unlocked Realme 12+ 5G will cost around $499 from any Realme outlet but $0 for the Realme 12+ 5G device when you pair it with a 24-month postpaid plan. While this may look attractive now, you may be paying more for a locked Realme 12+ 5G in the long run.

## Part 1: Asking the Carrier to Unlock

One of the best options is getting in touch with the carrier and asking them to unlock the SIM locked phone. For that to happen, it is important to first know whether the phone is SIM locked and then whether the phone can be unlocked and if you are eligible to unlock the phone. There is an eligibility clause in contract for Smartphones bought on contract and if a specific time period is not up yet, then a termination fee is required to be paid by the user to break the contract in order to be able to use any SIM on the Realme 12+ 5G device after getting the unlock code.

**_Pros_**

â¢ This is the best way to unlock carrier locked devices.

â¢ This is legal and everything happens based on the clause mentioned in the contract.

**_Cons  
_**

â¢ Sometimes, even the network providers or carrier refuse to unlock Smartphone

â¢ There is a certain time period which if not over yet, unlocking the phone would require termination fee.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
## Part 2: Professional Reputable Smartphone Unlock Service

If you have tried out contacting the carrier and there is no way the carrier is unlocking your phone, you can opt for professional unlock service which could be of help. But finding such a professional service is not an easy task. There are some sites and service providers which require the IMEI number of the phone to create unlock codes. IMEI number of the phone is given to the professional SIM unlock service post which, they generate a special character combination which can be used to get the cell phone out of network restrictions. So, the phone can be unlocked remotely by using the special remote unlock codes.

Sometimes, the professional Smartphone service providers even ask for the phone to be sent to them to get the phone unlocked.

**_Pros_**

â¢ This method could be opted as a last resort if there is no help from the carrier.

â¢ Professional and reputable Smartphone unlock service providers tend to serve the purpose as they are specialized in this task.

â¢ There are not many obligations involved.

**_Cons  
_**

â¢ This might attract legal actions against the user.

â¢ It is very difficult to find such professional Smartphone unlock service providers.

â¢ Reliability on such service providers is also another factor which requires attention.
