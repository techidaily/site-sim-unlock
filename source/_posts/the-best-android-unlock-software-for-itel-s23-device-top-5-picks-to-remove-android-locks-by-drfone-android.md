## Part 1: Difference between Unlocking, Rooting, and Jailbreaking

This part of the article shall differ from three very similar terms, Unlocking, Rooting, and Jailbreaking, to clear your confusion.

### Unlocking

<!-- affiliate ads begin -->
<a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2075471/7443" target="_top" id="2075471"><img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2075471" border="0" alt="" width="1200" height="600"/></a><img height="0" width="0" src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2075471/7443" style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0" />
<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![sim unlock](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/09/sim-unlock.jpg)

Unlocking a phone means making it compatible with other SIM carriers. An unlocked phone is not pinned to a single SIM carrier; rather, it lets you switch carriers. SIM Card lets your phone connect to a specific network, but it depends on your phone's hardware compatibility. If it's not compatible with a specific network, then nothing can change that.

To unlock your phone, you have to enter a specific code to remove the restrictions of the network. However, there are ways to unlock your phone without granting permission from the network.

### Rooting (for Android)

![androi root](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/09/root-android.jpg)

[Rooting a phone](https://drfone.wondershare.com/root/reasons-to-root-android.html) means gaining “root access” on another phone. **This process works for Android only.** However, it can also be used on some specific Linux-based devices. Root access allows you to do almost everything on the phone you’ve gained access to, like installing or uninstalling applications or changing the settings.

Root access is not all fun, and games as this process will lead you to the security architect of your operating system, which will be hard to deal with even if you're a professional. So, it’s important to be careful with this process, else you will have to bear the consequences.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### Jailbreaking (for iOS)

![iphone Jailbreak](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/09/iphone-jailbreak.jpg)

[Jailbreaking a device](https://drfone.wondershare.com/guide/how-to-jailbreak-ios-on-windows.html) means removing all the restrictions on that device that its manufacturer's applied. **This process works specifically for Apple devices.** It lets you bypass the limitations and restrictions, so you can modify the software your way and make changes to the default program. It is also considered free booting, and Apple or any other company does not approve of it.

In summary, unlocking is primarily about freeing a device from carrier restrictions, rooting is specific to Android devices and involves gaining administrative access, while jailbreaking is specific to iOS devices and involves bypassing Apple's restrictions for more customization. All these processes come with potential risks and may void warranties, so users should carefully consider the implications before proceeding.

It is advisable to always go for the safest method, unlocking your phone. Rooting and Jailbreaking are risky security exploitations that can cause serious problems.

## Part 2: Is it Legally Allowed to Unlock Your Itel S23?

Every country has its own rules and regulations. Similarly, laws regarding unlocking your phones are different in different countries. However, after sessions of deliberations and consultations, the US has declared it legal to unlock your phone.

In order to legally unlock your phone, you must make sure your phone service contracts, payments, and dues are cleared. You must be the sole owner of your phone. Once your phone is eligible and falls under the requirements, you will be given an “Unlock Code” to proceed further.

## Part 3: Free Ways to Perform Android SIM Efficiently

## Part 5: Tip to Avoid the SIM Lock Issue

In order to avoid the SIM Lock issue, it is advisable to use unlocked phones. This will save you from long-term hassle as you will have the freedom to switch carriers and SIM cards whenever you like.
