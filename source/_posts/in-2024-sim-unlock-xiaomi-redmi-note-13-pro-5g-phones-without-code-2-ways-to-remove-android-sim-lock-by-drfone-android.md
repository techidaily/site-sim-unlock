## Part 5: The benefits of an unlocked Xiaomi Redmi Note 13 Pro 5G

If you now know how to unlock Xiaomi Redmi Note 13 Pro 5G but still do not know its advantages, we are here to help.

As indicated in the introduction, unlocked phone users can freely choose the plans they subscribed to---on any carriers, in any country. Therefore, if you travel frequently around the world, having an unlocked Xiaomi Redmi Note 13 Pro 5G would be beneficial. Using a local SIM card is much cheaper than paying for exorbitant roaming charges.

You can also benefit from an unlocked Xiaomi Redmi Note 13 Pro 5G if you are the kind of person who likes to take advantage of current offers provided by your local carriers. Prepaid plans are always changing in terms of offering so having the flexibility of changing carriers and prepaid plans can help you save money in the long run.

## Part 6: The downside of an unlocked Xiaomi Redmi Note 13 Pro 5G

Are you thinking "Well, why can't I just buy an unlocked Xiaomi Redmi Note 13 Pro 5G in the first place?" right about now? Well, you can but think of the amount of money it will cost you.

For example, in Australia, an unlocked Xiaomi Redmi Note 13 Pro 5G will cost around $499 from any Xiaomi outlet but $0 for the Xiaomi Redmi Note 13 Pro 5G device when you pair it with a 24-month postpaid plan. While this may look attractive now, you may be paying more for a locked Xiaomi Redmi Note 13 Pro 5G in the long run.

## Conclusion
