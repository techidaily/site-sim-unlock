## The Ultimate Guide to Unlocking Your Apple iPhone 15 on MetroPCS

If you own an iPhone that is MetroPCS-branded, the carrier will probably lock it, making it impossible to use a SIM from another carrier on the Apple iPhone 15 device. Therefore, you will have to unlock iPhone MetroPCS for this purpose.

Many people find it difficult to unlock their MetroPCS iPhone and resort to buying a new phone altogether to use it with another service provider. In this article, you will learn how to use the MetroPCS unlock phones feature with three different methods. So, let’s get started!

### 1\. Calling MetroPCS to Unlock Phones

The first and most straightforward method to carrier unlocks MetroPCS phone is to call the company. But before you do that, make sure whether your phone has GSM/LTE or CDMA technology. Check for the small slot on the side of your phone to see whether there’s a SIM.

If your phone does not have a SIM, it uses CDMA technology. You will have to call your new carrier company and request them to unlock your phone in such a case. However, if you find a SIM card, your phone works on GSM or LTE and can easily be unlocked by contacting MetroPCS customer care.

Here’s how to do that:

**Step 1**

Call 1-888-863-8768 to reach the MetroPCS customer service, and request a MetroPCS network unlock code.

**Step 2**

They might ask you to provide your phone number, name on the MetroPCS account, email address, and PIN. Therefore, keep this information at hand.

**Step 3**

They will send you a confirmation email within 2 to 3 business days, containing the MetroPCS unlock code and instructions on how to use it.

**Step 4**

The instructions involve turning off your phone, inserting the SIM card of the new carrier, and entering the provided code when prompted. And that’s how you unlock your MetroPCS phone for free via the official method.

The downside of this method is again the time consumption. You have to call and wait for your turn, answer a bunch of questions, and wait for several days before receiving a confirmation email. If you want to save all this time, you can unlock iPhone MetroPCS for free using a more time-efficient method, i.e., using an unlock tool like [Dr.Fone – Sim Unlock](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/iphone-unlock/).

## Part 4: How to unlock Verizon iPhone via Verizon

This is an alternative means by which you can unlock Verizon iPhone 5. However, before we show you how to unlock Verizon iPhone, we should probably answer some frequently asked questions about this.

#### Can Verizon iPhones be unlocked?

The long and short of this is: YES, Verizon iPhones can be unlocked.

#### Will Verizon Unlock my Phone?

Now here's the kicker. Verizon is actually one of the most relaxed carriers out there and they don't generally lock their devices to begin with. However, YES, if your device is locked, Verizon does offer the service to unlock your phone if you contact them.

#### How to unlock Verizon iPhone via Verizon

As mentioned above, Verizon is surprisingly lax when it comes to locking phones, especially iPhones. In fact all Verizon 4G LTE devices are never locked to begin with, you can directly use them with any other carriers. So, if you want to shift Carriers, they just have a bunch of requirements that you need to meet first:

1\. If the phone was purchased on a 2 year contract then your contract needs to be complete with all 24 months paid for.

2\. If the purchase of the Apple iPhone 15 device was financed by Verizon Edge, or a two-year device payment plan, in that case you need to have paid off all overdue bills before you shift.

3\. The device shouldn't currently be reported as lost or stolen. Furthermore, if the Apple iPhone 15 device has ever been associated with any form of fraudulent activity then you aren't eligible.

4\. And if your phone still seems locked for none of the stated reasons you just contact them directly and they'll take care of it. There is no complicated means of doing this.

If you meet these requirements then you don't need to bother unlocking it, you can simply use another carrier.

If this seems too good to be true, or you have trouble believing us, then head on over to their Unlocking Policies and read it for yourself, just follow this link: [http://www.verizon.com/about/consumer-safety/device-unlocking-policy](http://www.verizon.com/about/consumer-safety/device-unlocking-policy)

#### **Step 1:** Retrieve IMEI Code

You can type #06# onto your Apple iPhone 15 keypad, and thus access the IMEI Code.

#### **Step 2:** Request Form

In the request form fill in the first 15 digits of the IMEI number, followed by your email address.

#### **Step 3:** Receive Unlock Status

Within the guaranteed period you'll receive the Unlock Status of your Verizon iPhone.

Verizon is one of the most relaxed carriers out there and they don't really lock your phones to begin with, but even so you have to serve out their contract period. This is the base requirement for unlocking any device from any carrier directly.

However, if you use a third party service like DoctorSIM - SIM Unlock Service then you don't have to bother about the requirements and don't have to bother verifying whether you're eligible, and you don't have to wait for 2 whole years before you can avail of your fundamental right to use whatever service you damn well please! DoctorSIM helps you take that agency onto your own hands and change your carrier whenever you want, and its an additional bonus that the process is ridiculously easy to follow, permanent, and doesn't lapse your warranty either.
