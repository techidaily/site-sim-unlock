## Network Locked SIM Card Inserted On Your Oppo A58 4G Phone? Unlock It Now

Carriers provide cellular connections so you can access the Internet, send text messages, and make phone calls without Wi-Fi. You cannot escape the carriers once you begin using a cell phone.

Customers can purchase a new handset via carriers or the mobile phone market. You may need an unlocked phone if you wish to use a different carrier's service on your smartphone. However, if you want a gadget linked to a specific SIM card, you may buy one from the carriers for a reduced price.

## Part 1: What Does It Mean If Your Oppo A58 4G Asks for SIM Network PIN?

When your phone prompts you to enter a SIM Network Unlock PIN, it means that your device is currently locked to a specific mobile network carrier, and it can only be used with SIM cards from that carrier. This locking mechanism is usually put in place by the carrier or the phone manufacturer to ensure that you continue to use their services, typically for the duration of a contract. As a result, your phone cannot be freely used with SIM cards from other carriers until it's unlocked using the correct PIN or code.

![remove network lock](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/11/fix-network-locked-simcard-inserted-2.jpg)

**System Errors**

Since SIM locking is a smartphone restriction implemented to stop it from being used on other networks, Android system errors can cause network-locked SIM cards. Resetting these errors can help unlock your **network locked SIM card inserted** device. Service providers decided to provide a formal SIM unlocking option as a result.

Because of this, any locked SIM may be readily unlocked, and once a device opens, it can work like a conventional mobile phone and with any SIM card of the user's choosing.

**Carrier Lock**

The consumer must stick with the same service provider for a specific time after purchasing the bundled device and data pack. This is called a carrier lock on the Oppo A58 4G device and is one of the most common errors in **network locked SIM card inserted** devices. During that time, the Oppo A58 4G device will be network- or SIM-locked, prohibiting the user from changing service providers.

The user cannot change the SIM. The service provider will offer the SIM Unlock code needed to unlock the handset when the contract expires. The gadget can be used with any other SIM card and exported to another country without problems when the network lock has been removed.

**Region Lock**

Apple and AT&T initially worked together to implement the SIM lock and the SIM locked devices. The original purpose was to force the user to continue using the same service provider in a specific area or time.

However, some telecom service providers sell the handsets with select data plans as bundled plans in collaboration with the Oppo A58 4G device manufacturers. As a result, the handset will cost less than it would otherwise. Sometimes, these offers are particular to a specific region, called a carrier lock.

**Firmware Problems**

Sometimes, the Oppo A58 4G device manufacturers release many versions of the same firmware for different geographical locations.

As a result, it may be possible that the user may face contradictions in the agreement of device firmware and the network-locked SIM card that was supposed to be used on the Oppo A58 4G device. Due to firmware problems, the users may also face a network-locked SIM card-inserted device.

## Part 3: How to Unlock Network Locked SIM Card Inserted?

Unlocking a network-locked SIM card may seem like a complex task. However, it can be a straightforward process if you follow the right steps. In this section, we will guide you through the process of unlocking your network-locked SIM card. We will discuss 3 different ways you can unlock a **network-locked SIM card inserted**:

### Method 1. Contact Network Carrier to Unlock Network Locked SIM

Contacting your network carrier is often the most recommended choice. It is a straightforward and reliable method to unlock your network-locked SIM card. Unlocking your network-locked SIM card through your carrier is a reliable and legal method. Before contacting your carrier, get information like your device's IMEI number and account details. There are several ways to get in touch with your network carrier's customer support.

You can call the customer support hotline, visit the website, or go to a physical store. The process usually involves receiving an unlock network code, which you need to use. Once you've entered the unlock code, your phone should display that it's now unlocked. Test it with the new SIM card to ensure that it can make calls, send texts, and access mobile data without any issues.

### Method 2. Use Online Unlock Service to Unlock Network Locked SIM

There are many online services available for unlocking a **network-locked SIM card**. In case you don't want to go through your network carrier, these can be a good alternative. These services employ the IMEI number of the Oppo A58 4G device to unlock smartphones.

One such service is [Canada Unlocking](https://canadaunlocking.com/), which offers to unlock your network-locked SIM card via email. Follow these steps to unlock a network-locked SIM card via online services:

**Step 1:** Use a web browser to access an online SIM card unlocking service like Canada Unlocking. On the main page, choose your network carrier or device brand.

### Bonus Tip. How to Unlock Network Locked Sim Card Inserted on iPhone?

If you want a fast and easy method to unlock your network-locked iPhone, you can use a third-party tool such as Dr.Fone – Screen Unlock (iOS). It is the best sim-unlock tool for iPhone users. It enables users to safely unlock their devices within five minutes. With Dr.Fone, you don’t have to wait for the sim-unlock code or reset your device firmware that can remove all your data.

You can download Dr.Fone on your PC and use it to unlock your iPhone without data loss. You can also use Dr.Fone to unlock your iPhone’s screen lock and Apple ID. Although Dr.Fone is a one-stop solution for all of your phone-related problems, its sim-unlock only works for Apple devices. Here is how you unlock your carrier-locked iPhone with Dr.Fone – Screen Unlock (IOS).

- Download and install Dr.Fone on your PC. Launch the application and select the “Screen Unlock” tab from the list on the homepage.

## Part 4: Why is SIM Unlocking Important?

As previously stated, a SIM lock enables a service provider to stop a customer from using the smartphone with the SIM cards of another service provider. This guarantees that the Oppo A58 4G device is only being used with the original SIM card for each provider. This locking also has a lot of drawbacks because it is incompatible with any other SIM card.

1. The phone cannot be used with other SIM cards if the SIM lock is enabled. Customers must therefore adhere to the current plan as is.
2. Since nobody wants to purchase a locked phone, it is hard for someone to sell or gift the mobile.
3. Traveling abroad with a SIM-locked phone could provide some challenges because you won't be able to use a local SIM card on the phone while you're there.

All the problems can be fixed, and the SIM works in any nation with the removed SIM lock.

### Conclusion

Any of the methods above can work to get around the prohibition against using other SIM cards with your Android handset. The best thing about using Dr.Fone-Screen Unlock is that you don't need unlocking codes to complete the tasks.
