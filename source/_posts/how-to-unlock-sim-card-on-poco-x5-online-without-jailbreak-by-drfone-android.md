## How to Unlock SIM Card on Poco X5 online without jailbreak

Isn't it so frustrating when you try to change your SIM or your network, but just can't because your phone is locked under contract? Phones are our life source in this global age, it's our tether to reality, to the world! But if you have a carrier locked phone, then that connection is basically under contract by an external agency! You can't change your networks, there are limitations on how you use your phone, and when you have to travel abroad you have no option other than paying the roaming charges. If you, say, have an iPhone 5c and have these frustrations, it's likely you're already wondering how to unlock the iPhone 5c.

Chances are that if you've had a carrier locked phone for a while, you might have already forgotten what cellular freedom feels like. But we're here to remind you. All you have to do is break that carrier-lock, and you're good to go. However, you should be careful when doing so, cause if you try using a jailbreaking technique, it could have major repercussions. So we're here to give you some valuable advice about how to unlock iPhone 5, iPhone 5c, or even Android phones.

## Part 1: Unlock SIM Card on Poco X5 via jailbreak

Before we get into telling you how to unlock iPhone 5, or the SIM Card on iPhone or Android, we should first tell you what Jailbreaking is. You might have heard of this term before, and I'm sure it sounded ominous to you. Jailbreak? It sounds awfully close to 'Prison break.' Well, considering the carrier lock is sort of like a prison for your cell, it is an accurate terminology. But Jailbreak isn't just about breaking the carrier lock. That might happen as a by-product, but the real purpose is to break free of the software restrictions which are generally applied to Apple devices. This might seem like a good option because, well, who doesn't want to break free of all of Apple's restrictions? But that always comes at several heavy risks.

### Threats of unlocking SIM via Jailbreak

#### 1\. Not Permanent

This has got to be one of the biggest reasons for not jailbreaking your phone. It is not at all permanent! In fact, the moment you update your system, your jailbreak is lost and if you've started using a different SIM it will no longer function, and you're gonna have to go back to using that Carrier you tried so hard to escape from! It's really not worth the effort. Of course, you could stop updating altogether, but then that will bring us to…

![Unlock SIM Card on iPhone and Android via jailbreak](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2016/10/14771444107532.jpg)

#### 2\. Risky

If you don't update your iOS, or Mac or iPad or any device at all, in this day and age, you're basically just asking to be hacked. That is not to excuse those who do the hacking and plant malware on your system, but if you leave your front door open in a shitty neighborhood, well then you only have yourself to blame once you get robbed!

#### 3\. Warranty

Jailbreaking has now become kind-of-legal, in a very tenuous sense, but that doesn't mean Apple wholeheartedly welcomes jailbreaking. If you do so, you will never again be able to avail of the warranty on your phone. And with the kind of major bucks you have to shell out for those iPhones, you best keep that warranty intact.

#### 4\. Lack of Apps

Many top-notch and crucial app companies and organizations simply refuse to make their applications usable in jailbreak phones, as they are extremely risky and prone to hacking. As a result, you would have to rely on a bunch of non-professional apps made by amateurs, which is more likely to put your phone in harm's way.

#### 5\. Bricking

This basically means your whole system may crash and stop functioning. As a result, you're gonna' have to restore the whole thing and try to salvage whatever information you can. Now those who do jailbreak regularly will give you all kinds of excuses like it happens only rarely or that you can retrieve your data simply from the cloud, et al. But do you really want to divest all your time and energy trying to fight off malware, backing up all your data, etc, especially when there is a much more convenient option just around the corner?

Didn't think so.

## Part 1: Official Ways To Unlock SIM Cards With a Lost PUK Code

Locking your SIM card with a forgotten PIN can be a frustrating experience, especially when your trusty PUK code seems to have vanished. While unauthorized methods exist to unlock your SIM card, venturing down that path can lead to complications and potential security risks. This guide prioritizes safe and official methods, ensuring a smooth and secure unlocking process with the help of your mobile carrier.

Firstly, remember that the PUK code typically arrives alongside your SIM card in its original packaging. Keeping this information safe alongside your other crucial documents is always helpful. However, if memory betrays you and the packaging is nowhere to be found, this part will show you **how to unlock SIM cards without PUK codes** with the help of your carrier.

### Method 1: Contacting Your Carrier’s Customer Service

Be prepared to answer security questions and provide relevant account details to ensure a smooth process.

- **Verify your identity.**Answer the security questions or provide the requested account details to confirm that you’re the authorized user.
- **Receive your PUK code/new SIM card.** Once verified, the representative will provide you with your PUK code. Be sure to write it down in a secure location for future reference. They might offer you a replaced SIM card if no PUK codes exist.
- **Unlock your SIM card.**Enter the PUK code on your phone following the specific instructions provided by your carrier. This typically involves entering the PUK code followed by a new PIN.

- **Step 2:** Different carriers have varying website layouts, so refer to their specific instructions or search features to find the dedicated section for retrieving PUK codes.
- **Step 3:** Similar to contacting customer service, you might need to verify your account ownership through security questions or other verification methods.
- **Step 4:** Once verified, your PUK code should be displayed on the screen or sent to your registered email address.

Remember, these steps are general guidelines, and specific procedures may vary depending on your carrier. Consult your carrier’s website or contact customer service for the most accurate and up-to-date information.
