## Three Ways to Sim Unlock Nokia 105 Classic

You probably purchased your Nokia 105 Classic for a significant discount but are now stuck with the same network for a couple of years. You loved the Nokia 105 Classic device but your network provider does not have any plans that exactly suit your needs. To release your device from your current network's clutches, you will need to unlock your phone.

There are three ways you can do it and this post will go through each method so that you can find one that you are most comfortable with. Do note that if your contract has ended with your network provider, this "How to unlock Nokia 105 Classic" post can be skipped as you can just ask them to unlock your phone or purchase a [sim network unlock pin](https://drfone.wondershare.com/unlock/unlock-samsung-sim-network-unlock-pin.html) for a minimal price.

## Part 1: Nokia 105 Classic Unlock Code

This is probably the easiest, no-fuss method to [sim unlock](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/unlock-android-screen/) Nokia 105 Classic. Follow these steps carefully to successfully perform Nokia 105 Classic unlock code.

Do take note that this process may not work with your carrier. Therefore, always check if this is the right way to obtain the necessary code:

HOWEVER, if your first instinct is to head to Google Play to look for SIM unlock tools, heed these cautions.

## Part 5: The benefits of an unlocked Nokia 105 Classic

If you now know how to unlock Nokia 105 Classic but still do not know its advantages, we are here to help.

As indicated in the introduction, unlocked phone users can freely choose the plans they subscribed to---on any carriers, in any country. Therefore, if you travel frequently around the world, having an unlocked Nokia 105 Classic would be beneficial. Using a local SIM card is much cheaper than paying for exorbitant roaming charges.

You can also benefit from an unlocked Nokia 105 Classic if you are the kind of person who likes to take advantage of current offers provided by your local carriers. Prepaid plans are always changing in terms of offering so having the flexibility of changing carriers and prepaid plans can help you save money in the long run.

## Part 6: The downside of an unlocked Nokia 105 Classic

Are you thinking "Well, why can't I just buy an unlocked Nokia 105 Classic in the first place?" right about now? Well, you can but think of the amount of money it will cost you.

For example, in Australia, an unlocked Nokia 105 Classic will cost around $499 from any Nokia outlet but $0 for the Nokia 105 Classic device when you pair it with a 24-month postpaid plan. While this may look attractive now, you may be paying more for a locked Nokia 105 Classic in the long run.

## Conclusion

Now that you know the three ways of unlocking your Nokia 105 Classic, all you need to do is find one that is most compatible with you. Just remember to think of everything through and carefully. Most importantly, if you have a locked device, always seek advice from your carrier to see if this is possible.
