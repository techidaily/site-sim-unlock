## Part 2: The Best Infinix Hot 40 SIM Unlock Code Generator

To safely and successfully sim unlock your Infinix Hot 40, it is important to find a trustworthy [sim network unlock pin software](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/unlock-android-screen/). Here I am going you present to you DoctorSIM - SIM Unlock Service. It definitely is one of the best sim unlocking code generators in the market. It helps you permanently sim unlock your phone so you can use it on any carrier provider you want in the world.

### How to use SIM Unlock Service

Step 1. Visit Doctor - SIM Unlock Service official website, click on the Select Your Infinix Hot 40 button, and then select Infinix among all the phone brands.

Step 2. On the new window, fill in your phone IMEI number, model, your contact email, and other required information. Once your order is processed, the system will then send you the unlock code and instructions. You can follow the instruction to unlock your phone easily.

## Part 3: Infinix Hot 40 Unlock Carrier

If your Infinix Hot 40 is hard locked, this is your best bet in getting your device unlocked. Actually, it is the safest method among all three:

1. Get a new SIM card from a new carrier.
2. Call your carrier's customer service line and ask what are the requirements to qualify you to get your Infinix Hot 40 unlocked. If you have honored your contract, there should not be any problems. However, do ask your carrier if there are any additional requirements. Do note that there may be fees involved.
3. Once your customer service representative has determined if you have met all their requirements, they should give you the SIM network unlock PIN Infinix Hot 40. Again, depending on your carrier, they might either give you the code over the phone, through email or via SMS. If you have the choice, always opt for email or SMS so that you are able to jot down the right number.
4. Once you have gotten the code, insert the new SIM card (from your new carrier). You will receive a prompt to enter your code. Make sure that you key in the right code---entering the wrong code will cause your phone to be locked (possibly forever).

## Part 5: The benefits of an unlocked Infinix Hot 40

If you now know how to unlock Infinix Hot 40 but still do not know its advantages, we are here to help.

As indicated in the introduction, unlocked phone users can freely choose the plans they subscribed to---on any carriers, in any country. Therefore, if you travel frequently around the world, having an unlocked Infinix Hot 40 would be beneficial. Using a local SIM card is much cheaper than paying for exorbitant roaming charges.

You can also benefit from an unlocked Infinix Hot 40 if you are the kind of person who likes to take advantage of current offers provided by your local carriers.

## Part 6: The downside of an unlocked Infinix Hot 40

Are you thinking "Well, why can't I just buy an unlocked Infinix Hot 40 in the first place?" right about now? Well, you can but think of the amount of money it will cost you.

For example, in Australia, an unlocked Infinix Hot 40 will cost around $499 from any Infinix outlet but $0 for the Infinix Hot 40 device when you pair it with a 24-month postpaid plan. While this may look attractive now, you may be paying more for a locked Infinix Hot 40 in the long run.
