## Three Ways to Sim Unlock Honor 80 Pro Straight Screen Edition

You probably purchased your Honor 80 Pro Straight Screen Edition for a significant discount but are now stuck with the same network for a couple of years. You loved the Honor 80 Pro Straight Screen Edition device but your network provider does not have any plans that exactly suit your needs. To release your device from your current network's clutches, you will need to unlock your phone.

There are three ways you can do it and this post will go through each method so that you can find one that you are most comfortable with.

1. Get a new SIM card from a new carrier.

## Part 5: The benefits of an unlocked Honor 80 Pro Straight Screen Edition

If you now know how to unlock Honor 80 Pro Straight Screen Edition but still do not know its advantages, we are here to help.

As indicated in the introduction, unlocked phone users can freely choose the plans they subscribed to---on any carriers, in any country. Therefore, if you travel frequently around the world, having an unlocked Honor 80 Pro Straight Screen Edition would be beneficial. Using a local SIM card is much cheaper than paying for exorbitant roaming charges.

You can also benefit from an unlocked Honor 80 Pro Straight Screen Edition if you are the kind of person who likes to take advantage of current offers provided by your local carriers. Prepaid plans are always changing in terms of offering so having the flexibility of changing carriers and prepaid plans can help you save money in the long run.

## Part 6: The downside of an unlocked Honor 80 Pro Straight Screen Edition

Are you thinking "Well, why can't I just buy an unlocked Honor 80 Pro Straight Screen Edition in the first place?" right about now? Well, you can but think of the amount of money it will cost you.

For example, in Australia, an unlocked Honor 80 Pro Straight Screen Edition will cost around $499 from any Honor outlet but $0 for the Honor 80 Pro Straight Screen Edition device when you pair it with a 24-month postpaid plan. While this may look attractive now, you may be paying more for a locked Honor 80 Pro Straight Screen Edition in the long run.
