## 4 Best Methods to Unlock Apple iPhone 6s

Following are three methods to unlock Apple iPhone 6s

### Method 1: Contact your carrier for unlock code

When a customer signs a contract with a big cell phone company for a certain amount of time, they often get a discount on a device. Because of this, the Apple iPhone 6s device comes with a controller lock so customers can only use it on their network.

You can leave without paying anything if your agreement with the company is over. You must meet the following requirements before you can unlock your Apple iPhone 6s:

![sim unlock pin](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/12/how-to-unlock-iphone-11-12-4.jpg)

- First, the Apple iPhone 6s device must be legal. It means the Apple iPhone 6s device has not been reported as lost, stolen, or connected to a crime.
- Then you shouldn't have any debts in your bank account.
- If you signed a contract in exchange for a lower price upfront, you would have to wait until your contract ended (usually 24 months) or pay the remaining balance if you bought your phone on a payment plan.

Note: the unlocking process is different for each company.

**How to unlock the Apple iPhone 6s locked by AT&T**

First, you need to know that AT&T limits how many devices a customer can unlock in a given year. Customers can unlock up to five devices per year if their account is in great condition.

**AT&T Unlocking security question**

- The full name of the person whose name is on the account
- Last four digits of the account holder's social security number
- AT&T passcode of the registered account owner if they have an online account.
- The IMEI number of the Apple iPhone 6s is 11/12. The serial number of the Apple iPhone 6s device is called the IMEI number. You can find it on the original packaging, under the battery, and on the back of some models, by dialing #06 or navigating to Settings > General > About.

**How to unlock the Apple iPhone 6s locked by T-Mobile**

T-Mobile has set several standards that should be matched to complete an unlock request.

- The device must be completely paid off, and the account must be in great condition.
- In the past 12 months, less than two SIM unlock codes for each line have been asked for.
- The device had used the T-Mobile network for at least 40 days before it was asked to be unlocked.
- If you have a service contract and have made a payment for at least 18 consecutive months, or if you paid a relocation fee. There are a few special cases that Customer Service can explain in more detail if required.
- The phone must have at least $50 worth of recharges paid for on prepaid plans.
- If you meet the above prerequisites, you can unlock an Apple iPhone 6s carrier locked by a T-Mobile device by calling customer service at 611 from the Apple iPhone 6s device you want to unlock.
- Make sure you have ALL of the following information on tips when you call:

1. The main account holder's phone number
2. Account Password
3. Account holder's SSN's last four digits
4. IMEI number. You can find this by navigating Settings > General > About or dialing \*#06#.

**AppleiPhoneUnlock**

This website says that it can help you unlock your Apple iPhone 6s or iPad. Please prepare your IMEI code and confirm the Apple iPhone 6s device model.

##  Part 1: How to SIM Unlock Your Apple iPhone 6s?

There are several ways to unlock your device. Let's look at a few of them.

### 1\. Contact your Carrier and Have them unlock the Apple iPhone 6s device for you

This is probably the safest way to do it. If you have already completed payments on your Apple iPhone 6s or you bought it outright, you can ask your carrier for the [sim network unlock pin](https://drfone.wondershare.com/unlock/unlock-samsung-sim-network-unlock-pin.html) to unlock your device. Depending on your carrier, you may have to pay for this service, and it also does take up to 7 days, sometimes more for them to get back to you.

### 2\. Software Unlocking

This is where you download a piece of [sim network unlock pin software](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/unlock-android-screen/) on to your device. This software makes changes to the Apple iPhone 6s device, allowing you to make calls from any carrier. While this may sound straight-forward and easy, except it is highly risky and will not work for iPhone 4 and later models.

### 3\. Hardware Unlocking

This is where you alter the hardware of the Apple iPhone 6s device to create an alternate path to deliver calls. Although this can be done, it also alters your device irreparably and probably also voids your warranty. Not to mention, you may pay more than $200 to have the Apple iPhone 6s device unlocked in this way.

This is the best way to unlock your device and by far the easiest. This method uses your device's IMEI number to access the IMEI database and change the status of the Apple iPhone 6s from locked to unlocked. There are very many services that you can use to IMEI unlock your device, and most of them will offer the service for a fee. But this is a great solution because there is no software to download, and you don't mess with the hardware in any way.
