This can be a problem when you want to change carriers. Some iPhones are generally easier to unlock than others, and the easiest way to unlock any iPhone is usually to use a paid online service. The issue is that these services can be very expensive.

Many people may wonder whether it is legal to unlock the iPhone. Actually, it is perfectly legal to unlock your Apple iPhone XS Max if you have completed payments on the contract, or you bought the Apple iPhone XS Max device outright. If however, you are still in the process of paying for your contract, you don't fully own the phone and so you should contact the carrier before unlocking it.

##  Part 1: How to SIM Unlock Your Apple iPhone XS Max?

There are several ways to unlock your device. Let's look at a few of them.

### 1\. Contact your Carrier and Have them unlock the Apple iPhone XS Max device for you

This is probably the safest way to do it. If you have already completed payments on your Apple iPhone XS Max or you bought it outright, you can ask your carrier for the [sim network unlock pin](https://drfone.wondershare.com/unlock/unlock-samsung-sim-network-unlock-pin.html) to unlock your device. Depending on your carrier, you may have to pay for this service, and it also does take up to 7 days, sometimes more for them to get back to you.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### 2\. Software Unlocking

This is where you download a piece of [sim network unlock pin software](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/unlock-android-screen/) on to your device. This software makes changes to the Apple iPhone XS Max device, allowing you to make calls from any carrier. While this may sound straight-forward and easy, except it is highly risky and will not work for iPhone 4 and later models.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### 3\. Hardware Unlocking

This is where you alter the hardware of the Apple iPhone XS Max device to create an alternate path to deliver calls. Although this can be done, it also alters your device irreparably and probably also voids your warranty. Not to mention, you may pay more than $200 to have the Apple iPhone XS Max device unlocked in this way.

### 4\. IMEI unlocking

This is the best way to unlock your device and by far the easiest. This method uses your device's IMEI number to access the IMEI database and change the status of the Apple iPhone XS Max from locked to unlocked. There are very many services that you can use to IMEI unlock your device, and most of them will offer the service for a fee. But this is a great solution because there is no software to download, and you don't mess with the hardware in any way.

## Part 2: The Best SIM Unlock Service - Dr.Fone

A SIM unlock PIN is an effective way to remove your SIM lock effectively. However, it may not work sometimes.

For instance, some network providers require only the original owner of the phone can get the code. So, if you have a second-hand contract iPhone, you can't find the unlock PIN. If your Apple iPhone XS Max is X/8(Plus)/7(Plus)/SE/6S(Plus)/6(Plus)/5S, luckily, I will introduce an amazing software to help unlock your SIM card permanently. That is [Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock (iOS)](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/iphone-unlock/).

## How to Unlock Apple iPhone XS Max with IMEI Code?

If you have a locked iPhone, we have different methods that entail how to unlock iPhone with IMEI code. Apart from this, we have two separate unlocking methods which usually confuse a good number of people. These methods are Sim Unlock and iCloud activation lock bypass. The difference between the two is that the Sim unlock method involves unlocking the sim lock while the iCloud activation revolves around unlocking the automatic iCloud activation security feature.  

If you want to know how to unlock iPhone with IMEI number and how to bypass iCloud lock, I have with me two different methods that will unlock your locked iPhone in a span of days as long as you follow the required steps.  

## Part 1: What is IMEI code? How to find IMEI Code on iPhone?

Each and every phone comes with a unique 15-digit code that differentiates it from other devices. This unique code acts as determinant or a tracking number when you happen to lose your phone. For those with iPhones, you can retrieve this unique number in different ways. The following are some of them.

**1.1 Dial \*#06#**

This is the primary method of checking your IMEI code on almost all devices. On your dial pad, dial \*#06# and press the call icon. Your unique code will be displayed immediately.

**1.2 The Sim Tray**

Another way of retrieving your IMEI code is by removing your Sim Card tray. In most devices especially iPhone 4, this number is usually located on the Sim tray.

**1.3 The Back of the Phone**

## The Ultimate Guide to Unlocking Your Apple iPhone XS Max on MetroPCS

### 1\. Calling MetroPCS to Unlock Phones

The first and most straightforward method to carrier unlocks MetroPCS phone is to call the company. But before you do that, make sure whether your phone has GSM/LTE or CDMA technology. Check for the small slot on the side of your phone to see whether there’s a SIM.

If your phone does not have a SIM, it uses CDMA technology. You will have to call your new carrier company and request them to unlock your phone in such a case. However, if you find a SIM card, your phone works on GSM or LTE and can easily be unlocked by contacting MetroPCS customer care.

Here’s how to do that:

**Step 1**

Call 1-888-863-8768 to reach the MetroPCS customer service, and request a MetroPCS network unlock code.

**Step 2**

They might ask you to provide your phone number, name on the MetroPCS account, email address, and PIN. Therefore, keep this information at hand.

**Step 3**

They will send you a confirmation email within 2 to 3 business days, containing the MetroPCS unlock code and instructions on how to use it.

**Step 4**

The instructions involve turning off your phone, inserting the SIM card of the new carrier, and entering the provided code when prompted. And that’s how you unlock your MetroPCS phone for free via the official method.

The downside of this method is again the time consumption. You have to call and wait for your turn, answer a bunch of questions, and wait for several days before receiving a confirmation email. If you want to save all this time, you can unlock iPhone MetroPCS for free using a more time-efficient method, i.e., using an unlock tool like [Dr.Fone – Sim Unlock](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/iphone-unlock/).

If you have any problems during the sim unlocking process, you can follow [the Sim unlock guide](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/iphone-unlock/) in detail to carrier unlock the MetroPCS phone. This process involves several steps and might seem long, but it hardly takes 5 to 10 minutes. Also, it is the safest and most reliable way with a high success rate to unlock iPhone MetroPCS.

If you’re looking for a way to unlock your MetroPCS phone for free but without going through technical steps, you can use the Apple iPhone XS Max device Unlock app.

### 3\. Unlock MetroPCS Phone Using an App

The Device Unlock app is automatically installed in MetroPCS-locked phones, so you can easily find it in the apps folder or the MetroPCS folder. However, this app is only compatible with Android devices.

So, if you have an Android phone, follow these steps to unlock it using the Apple iPhone XS Max device Unlock app:

**Step 1**

Connect your phone to a Wi-Fi internet connection, and launch the Apple iPhone XS Max device Unlock app.

**Step 3**

Once your device has been unlocked, the app will ask you to restart your phone, after which the Apple iPhone XS Max device will be permanently unlocked, and you can use any network's sim card on it.

### Troubleshooting Issues

It is possible that when you use the Apple iPhone XS Max device Unlock app, some error messages might pop up. Here are the common errors and their solutions:

1. If you get the following errors:

- Data corrupted
- Server not responding
- No internet connection
- Failure to apply to unlock

Turn off your Wi-Fi, and move to a place that has strong signals. Now turn your Wi-Fi back on and try again.

2. If you get the “Data not recognized” errors, you’ll have to unroot your phone. For this, search for the unroot guide for your smartphone’s specific model and follow the instructions.

3. For the “System maintenance error,” wait for a few hours and then try again, as the system might be going through maintenance and won’t process the unlock.

## FAQs on MetroPCS Unlock Phone

Here are some frequently asked questions by our customers:

### Q. What is the MetroPCS unlock code?

The company provides a MetroPCS unlock code, which is used to unlock your MetroPCS-locked iPhone. Upon requesting the code, you will receive it via email and instructions on how to use it. All you have to do is follow those instructions and enter the MetroPCS unlock code when prompted to unlock your Apple iPhone XS Max and use it with other carriers.

### Q. How can I tell if My Apple iPhone XS Max is eligible to unlock if it's MetroPCS?

MetroPCS has some eligibility requirements to unlock your Apple iPhone XS Max. The criteria to be eligible are:

1. You must have purchased your Apple iPhone XS Max from MetroPCS.
2. The device to be unlocked must not be stolen, lost, or blocked.
3. The device must be activated for 180 days to be eligible to be unlocked.

If you fulfill these requirements, your phone is eligible to be unlocked.

### Q. What do I do if I unlock My Apple iPhone XS Max and now my SIM card doesn't work?

If you get this error, it means that the SIM card you have inserted into the Apple iPhone XS Max device is not supported by the activation policy assigned by the activation server. To solve this issue, you need a SIM from a supported carrier and request them to unlock the iPhone.

### Conclusion

If you own an iPhone locked by MetroPCS but want to use another carrier’s SIM on it, you will have to unlock your phone first. There are several ways to do so. You can either do it the official way by calling MetroPCS and requesting a MetroPCS unlock code, or you can do it easily by using a third-party unlock tool like Dr.Fone. Then there’s a third way that involves using a device unlock app.

While all 3 ways are easy, they require time and patience, except for Dr.Fone, which lets you unlock your Apple iPhone XS Max within 5 minutes. So, save your time and money and go for a reliable and foolproof way to unlock iPhone MetroPCS, the Dr.Fone way!
