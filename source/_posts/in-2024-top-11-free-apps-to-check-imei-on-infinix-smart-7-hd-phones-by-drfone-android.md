### Q3: What is the Master Unlock Code for a Samsung?

A Master PIN code, also known as a [Samsung Unlock Code](https://drfone.wondershare.com/unlock/samsung-unlock-codes.html), is a unique numeric code that can be used to unlock a Samsung device. This code is typically provided by the manufacturer or carrier and is used to remove any restrictions or limitations on the Infinix Smart 7 HD device. It allows the user to use the Infinix Smart 7 HD device with any carrier or SIM card, giving them more flexibility and freedom. It is important to note that the Master PIN code is different from the Infinix Smart 7 HD device's regular PIN or password, and it should be kept confidential to prevent unauthorized access to the Infinix Smart 7 HD device.

### Q4: Can I Remove an Android Lock Without Losing My Data?

If your device is Samsung or LG, Dr.Fone could help unlock your screen without erasing your data. Please check if your tool model is involved in the [device information list](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/unlock-android-screen/).
