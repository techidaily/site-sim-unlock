## Tutorial to Change Lava Yuva 3 IMEI without Root: A Comprehensive Guide

As an Android device user, you may have come across a situation where you need to change your device IMEI number. The International Mobile Equipment Identity (IMEI) is a unique 15-digit number assigned to every mobile device, such as smartphones and tablets. This number serves as an identifier, helping to distinguish your device from millions of others. One of the main reasons people want to change their Android IMEI number is to unblock a device that has been blacklisted by their network provider. Other reasons include accessing certain network features and services or maintaining anonymity.

Changing your Android IMEI without root access may seem like a daunting task, but this comprehensive guide will walk you through the process step-by-step. Before proceeding, please note that altering your device's IMEI number can be illegal in some countries, and may void your warranty. Proceed with caution and at your own risk. Get to know **how to change IMEI number** now!

## Part 1: What is IMEI and Why People Change The IMEI Number

The International Mobile Equipment Identity (IMEI) is a unique identifier for every mobile device. It allows network providers and manufacturers to track and block devices if they are reported as lost or stolen. Changing your device's IMEI can help to unblock a blacklisted device, access certain network features and services, or maintain anonymity. However, be aware that altering your IMEI number is illegal in some countries and may void your warranty.

![imei number](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/05/imei-number.jpg)

### There are several uses of the IMEI number

1. As the use of mobile devices increases, the statistics of stolen and lost devices have been increasing as well. Users can block stolen or lost devices for further usage if they know their IMEI number. All users need to call their network carrier and report that the Lava Yuva 3 device is stolen or lost. The carrier can block the specific device from running on their network and notify other carriers.
2. The 15-digit IMEI number indicates the origin and model of the Lava Yuva 3 device. The first eight digits indicate the Lava Yuva 3 device's origin and its model while the last six digits identify the Lava Yuva 3 device's manufacturer.
3. If you subscribe to a mobile tracking service, you can use the IMEI number to track the Lava Yuva 3 device---even if it uses a different SIM card.

### Pros and Cons of Changing Android IMEI

Like many other things out there, changing Android IMEI has both advantages and disadvantages. Here are some of them:

**Advantages**

1. Make your Android untraceable. By constantly changing your IMEI, you will throw off the tracks of people using it to stalk you!
2. Fix any invalid IMEI-related issues such as lost or invalid IMEI numbers. Once you change your IMEI, your Android device with the same benefits and features.
3. Obtaining a completely new device ID.
4. Changing the IMEI number to one that indicates it is a newer model, you will be able to enjoy new OS updates by resetting, repairing, and updating your Android device.
5. Have you ever yearned for that cheap BlackBerry plan your network carrier keeps on promoting? The 15-digit IMEI indicates the origin and model of your device. Therefore, by changing your Android's IMEI number to that of a BlackBerry's, you will be able to subscribe to a cheaper mobile plan.

**Disadvantages**

1. Before we begin, we need to make it clear that the process of changing IMEI without root can be illegal in some countries. We advise you to check the laws and regulations in your country before attempting to change your device’s IMEI number. As far as we know, it is legal in Africa and Asia, and illegal in Europe.
2. The IMEI number is hardcoded into your device. Therefore, changing your device’s IMEI number may void your device warranty and cause other issues such as network problems and software instability.
3. Legally, you have forfeited your ownership of your mobile device. When you purchase your device, the seller will jot down the original IMEI number on your receipt. So if you changed your IMEI and lost it, you may not be able to claim it. This is because authorities cannot see if it is truly yours. After all, the IMEI numbers no longer correlate with each other.

### Method 1: Locate IMEI through the Settings App

### Method 4: Find IMEI on a Removable Battery (for older devices)

For older Android devices with removable batteries, you can find the IMEI number printed on a sticker underneath the battery. To locate it, follow these steps:

## Part 3: Does IMEI Change With SIM Card?

No, swapping or changing the SIM card does not alter the IMEI (International Mobile Equipment Identity). The IMEI persists unchanged throughout the Lava Yuva 3 device's lifetime, functioning as a distinctive identifier solely for that particular device.

The IMEI is a 15-digit code assigned to each mobile device. It's separate from the SIM card, which stores information related to the subscriber and the carrier network. The SIM card contains data specific to the subscriber. This includes contacts, text messages, and network-related information. But it does not alter or affect the IMEI of the Lava Yuva 3 device.

The IMEI remains the same even if you change SIM cards or switch between different carriers. It's essentially a static identifier tied to the Lava Yuva 3 device's hardware. It is used by mobile networks and authorities to identify and track devices on the network.

## Part 4: Does IMEI Change After Factory Reset?

No, performing a factory reset on your mobile device does not change its IMEI (International Mobile Equipment Identity). The IMEI is a unique identifier assigned to the hardware of the Lava Yuva 3 device. It remains constant throughout the life of the Lava Yuva 3 device, irrespective of any software changes or resets.

A factory reset wipes the data and settings on your device, returning it to its original factory state. This process erases user-installed apps, personal data, and settings. But it doesn’t affect the Lava Yuva 3 device's hardware identification, including the IMEI.

The IMEI is embedded into the hardware of the Lava Yuva 3 device. It is typically printed on the Lava Yuva 3 device's packaging or can be found by dialing \*#06# on the phone's keypad. It's a crucial identifier for mobile networks, and authorities use it to uniquely identify and track devices across networks. It remains unchanged even after a factory reset.

## Part 1: Official Ways To Unlock SIM Cards With a Lost PUK Code

It helps you permanently sim unlock your phone so you can use it on any carrier provider you want in the world.

### How to use SIM Unlock Service

Step 1. Visit Doctor - SIM Unlock Service official website, click on the Select Your Lava Yuva 3 button, and then select Lava among all the phone brands.

Step 2. On the new window, fill in your phone IMEI number, model, your contact email, and other required information. Once your order is processed, the system will then send you the unlock code and instructions. You can follow the instruction to unlock your phone easily.

## Part 3: Lava Yuva 3 Unlock Carrier

If your Lava Yuva 3 is hard locked, this is your best bet in getting your device unlocked. Actually, it is the safest method among all three:

1. Get a new SIM card from a new carrier.
2. Call your carrier's customer service line and ask what are the requirements to qualify you to get your Lava Yuva 3 unlocked. If you have honored your contract, there should not be any problems. However, do ask your carrier if there are any additional requirements. Do note that there may be fees involved.
3. Once your customer service representative has determined if you have met all their requirements, they should give you the SIM network unlock PIN Lava Yuva 3. Again, depending on your carrier, they might either give you the code over the phone, through email or via SMS. If you have the choice, always opt for email or SMS so that you are able to jot down the right number.
4. Once you have gotten the code, insert the new SIM card (from your new carrier). You will receive a prompt to enter your code. Make sure that you key in the right code---entering the wrong code will cause your phone to be locked (possibly forever).

## Part 4: Lava Yuva 3 Unlock App/Software

There are some of us out there who are just not confident with doing things ourselves or trusting our own carrier.

HOWEVER, if your first instinct is to head to Google Play to look for SIM unlock tools, heed these cautions. There are currently many apps that claim that they can unlock your phone but it is just a scam. You should also avoid torrent files available online. These apps and software are usually laced with Trojans and other types of malware. So do sort through the reviews so that you will not fall into a malicious trap.

One that we can attest to is  **[MyMobileUnlocking.com](http://mymobileunlocking.com/)**; it is fast and affordable. Here is how you can unlock your Lava Yuva 3:

- Choose your Country from the dropdown menu and click the  **Confirm country** button.

## Part 5: The benefits of an unlocked Lava Yuva 3

If you now know how to unlock Lava Yuva 3 but still do not know its advantages, we are here to help.

As indicated in the introduction, unlocked phone users can freely choose the plans they subscribed to---on any carriers, in any country. Therefore, if you travel frequently around the world, having an unlocked Lava Yuva 3 would be beneficial. Using a local SIM card is much cheaper than paying for exorbitant roaming charges.

You can also benefit from an unlocked Lava Yuva 3 if you are the kind of person who likes to take advantage of current offers provided by your local carriers. Prepaid plans are always changing in terms of offering so having the flexibility of changing carriers and prepaid plans can help you save money in the long run.

## Part 6: The downside of an unlocked Lava Yuva 3

Are you thinking "Well, why can't I just buy an unlocked Lava Yuva 3 in the first place?" right about now? Well, you can but think of the amount of money it will cost you.

For example, in Australia, an unlocked Lava Yuva 3 will cost around $499 from any Lava outlet but $0 for the Lava Yuva 3 device when you pair it with a 24-month postpaid plan. While this may look attractive now, you may be paying more for a locked Lava Yuva 3 in the long run.

## Conclusion

Now that you know the three ways of unlocking your Lava Yuva 3, all you need to do is find one that is most compatible with you. Just remember to think of everything through and carefully. Most importantly, if you have a locked device, always seek advice from your carrier to see if this is possible.
