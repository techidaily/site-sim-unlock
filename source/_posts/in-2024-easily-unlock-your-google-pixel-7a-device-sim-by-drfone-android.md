4. Once you have gotten the code, insert the new SIM card (from your new carrier). You will receive a prompt to enter your code. Make sure that you key in the right code---entering the wrong code will cause your phone to be locked (possibly forever).

## Part 5: The benefits of an unlocked Google Pixel 7a

If you now know how to unlock Google Pixel 7a but still do not know its advantages, we are here to help.

As indicated in the introduction, unlocked phone users can freely choose the plans they subscribed to---on any carriers, in any country. Therefore, if you travel frequently around the world, having an unlocked Google Pixel 7a would be beneficial. Using a local SIM card is much cheaper than paying for exorbitant roaming charges.

You can also benefit from an unlocked Google Pixel 7a if you are the kind of person who likes to take advantage of current offers provided by your local carriers. Prepaid plans are always changing in terms of offering so having the flexibility of changing carriers and prepaid plans can help you save money in the long run.

## Part 6: The downside of an unlocked Google Pixel 7a

Are you thinking "Well, why can't I just buy an unlocked Google Pixel 7a in the first place?" right about now? Well, you can but think of the amount of money it will cost you.

For example, in Australia, an unlocked Google Pixel 7a will cost around $499 from any Google outlet but $0 for the Google Pixel 7a device when you pair it with a 24-month postpaid plan. While this may look attractive now, you may be paying more for a locked Google Pixel 7a in the long run.

## Conclusion

Now that you know the three ways of unlocking your Google Pixel 7a, all you need to do is find one that is most compatible with you. Just remember to think of everything through and carefully. Most importantly, if you have a locked device, always seek advice from your carrier to see if this is possible.
