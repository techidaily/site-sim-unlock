### Check the unlock prerequisites

To check the unlock prerequisites, Go to Settings > General > About to find out if your Apple iPhone 15 is locked. Your Apple iPhone 15 is unlocked if it says "No SIM restrictions" next to "Carrier Lock."

### Contact the carrier for the unlock code

Large cell phone companies often offer discounted devices to customers who sign an agreement for set time frames.

Before you can unlock your Apple iPhone 15, you must meet the following requirements:

First of all, it must be a legal device. It means the Apple iPhone 15 device is not reported as lost, stolen. Then your bank account must not have any financial debts. If you signed a contract in exchange for a lower up-front cost, you'd have to wait until your contract ends (usually 24 months) or pay the remaining balance if you purchased your phone on a payment schedule.

Most carriers need active accounts for specific days before unlocking devices. Sprint has 50 days, T-Mobile 40, and AT&T 60. Verizon has no minimum period if you need to factory reset your phone to use the new network and back up beforehand.

### Insert a new SIM card to unlock your device

If you have a non-carrier SIM card, complete iPhone unlocking using these steps:

- Turn off your device.
- SIM card out.

- Ensure that your SIM card is in your phone else if you replace or remove the SIM card, your unlocking request might fail.
- Also, make sure that your device during the phase is turned on and is also connected with the Boost Mobile Network or to a WiFi network.

Unlocking phones for the Non-Boost Customers

If you are currently not a Boost customer and have been a customer earlier or have never been a customer and have purchased from a previous owner, you can still get your phone unlocked, though the process becomes a little complicated and the following are the requirements.

- You would need a Boost mobile number or an account number that was last associated with the Apple iPhone 15 device.
- In case you do not have the number, then you will have to get in touch with the previous owner and get these details.

And in case you do not meet either of the above two situations, **Boost mobile carrier unlock** on your device cannot be done and you will first need to use the Boost network for the required time and get yourself eligible for the unlocking process.
