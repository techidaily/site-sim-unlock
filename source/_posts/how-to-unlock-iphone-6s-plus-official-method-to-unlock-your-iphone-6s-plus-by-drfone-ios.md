### 1\. No Due Before Unlocking

When iPhone users sign contracts with a giant cell phone company for a certain amount of time, they often get a discount on a device. Because of this, the Apple iPhone 6s Plus device comes with a controller lock so customers can only use it on their network.

So, if you've paid off your contract or bought your Apple iPhone 6s Plus without a subsidy, it's perfectly legal to unlock it. But if you're still paying off your contract, you still need to own the Apple iPhone 6s Plus fully, so you should confirm with your carrier before unlocking it.

### 2\. You Should Buy It for More Than the Time Limit in the Contract

You can leave without paying anything if your agreement with the company is over. If you signed a contract in exchange for a lower price upfront, you would have to wait until your contract ended (usually 24 months) or pay the remaining balance if you bought your phone on a payment plan.

### Examples: Requirements of Sim Unlock of T-Mobile/EE/AT&T

T-Mobile, EE, and AT&T have common requirements before you can unlock your Apple iPhone 6s Plus.

- It has to be legal. It means the Apple iPhone 6s Plus device has not been reported as lost, stolen, or linked to a crime.
- Your bank account shouldn't have any debts.
- If you signed a contract in exchange for a lower price upfront, you would have to wait until your contract was up (usually 24 months) or pay the remaining balance if you bought your phone on a payment plan.

Apart from the requirements mentioned above, each company has its way of unlocking.

**T-Mobile**

1. The main account holder's phone number

## Part 1: Can Cricket Locked Apple iPhone 6s Plus Be Unlocked?

If you want to remove the carrier lock from your Apple iPhone 6s Plus, request **Cricket customer support for the network unlock code for free**. They’ll give it to you if they have it or can get it from the manufacturer. But first, make sure you meet the unlock requirements. The process depends on various factors, including your account status and the phone’s activation period.

![cricket wireless online support](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/02/unlock-cricket-iphone-02.jpg)

If you are wondering whether there are other ways to do it aside from reaching out to their customer support, read on.

Different Ways To Unlock Cricket iPhone

Here’s an overview of the options available:

Cricket Network Unlock Code Free From Cricket Wireless

It is the most straightforward approach, but it comes with some restrictions. You must meet Cricket’s unlock policy requirements. If you fulfill these conditions, you can request a **Cricket unlock code for free** online.

Early Unlocking for Military Personnel

Good news if you’re in the military. You can ask their customer support to unlock your Apple iPhone 6s Plus, even if you haven’t used the service for six months. Having a **Cricket device unlocked** earlier is a way to help you stay connected during deployments.

Third-Party iPhone Unlocking Tools

Not all devices can be unlocked by Cricket if you don’t qualify for their requirements. However, paid online services and third-party apps can open up your options. These tools can help you use your phone on any compatible carrier, even if you don’t meet **Cricket device unlock** requirements.

While this option can be faster, choosing a reputable service provider and understanding the associated risks is crucial. Ensure it is legal in your region and won’t harm your phone’s functionality.

Ready to **unlock Cricket iPhone**? But wait, are you sure you meet the eligibility criteria? Let’s find out in the next section.

## Part 2: What Are the Requirements To Unlock Cricket iPhone?

You might be here because you are considering using your Cricket iPhone on other carriers. Unlocking allows switching wireless networks or increasing resale value. But before that, you need to meet the following requirements to **unlock Cricket iPhones** using the official method:

- Active service: The Cricket iPhone must have been active with paid service for at least six months.
- Device Lock: The device must be locked to the Cricket network. You can check the lock status by contacting Cricket customer support.
- Device Status: Before you get the **Cricket network unlock code free**of charge, your phone cannot be reported lost, stolen, or involved in fraudulent activity.
- Account Status: Your Cricket account must be in good standing, meaning no outstanding balances or unpaid bills.

Exceptions for Active Military Personnel

If you’re in the military and can’t meet the six-month service rule, you can ask for a quick **device unlock from Cricket**. But there are still other requirements to fulfill, and you must show Cricket proof of your deployment. This proof can be military orders, deployment papers, or a letter from your commanding officer.
