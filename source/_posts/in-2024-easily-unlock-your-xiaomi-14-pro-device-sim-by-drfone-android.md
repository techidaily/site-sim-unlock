You probably purchased your Xiaomi 14 Pro for a significant discount but are now stuck with the same network for a couple of years. You loved the Xiaomi 14 Pro device but your network provider does not have any plans that exactly suit your needs. To release your device from your current network's clutches, you will need to unlock your phone.

## Part 1: Xiaomi 14 Pro Unlock Code

This is probably the easiest, no-fuss method to [sim unlock](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/unlock-android-screen/) Xiaomi 14 Pro. Follow these steps carefully to successfully perform Xiaomi 14 Pro unlock code.

1. Get a new SIM card from a new carrier.
2. Call your carrier's customer service line and ask what are the requirements to qualify you to get your Xiaomi 14 Pro unlocked. If you have honored your contract, there should not be any problems. However, do ask your carrier if there are any additional requirements. Do note that there may be fees involved.

## Part 5: The benefits of an unlocked Xiaomi 14 Pro

If you now know how to unlock Xiaomi 14 Pro but still do not know its advantages, we are here to help.

As indicated in the introduction, unlocked phone users can freely choose the plans they subscribed to---on any carriers, in any country. Therefore, if you travel frequently around the world, having an unlocked Xiaomi 14 Pro would be beneficial. Using a local SIM card is much cheaper than paying for exorbitant roaming charges.

You can also benefit from an unlocked Xiaomi 14 Pro if you are the kind of person who likes to take advantage of current offers provided by your local carriers. Prepaid plans are always changing in terms of offering so having the flexibility of changing carriers and prepaid plans can help you save money in the long run.

## Part 6: The downside of an unlocked Xiaomi 14 Pro

Are you thinking "Well, why can't I just buy an unlocked Xiaomi 14 Pro in the first place?" right about now? Well, you can but think of the amount of money it will cost you.

For example, in Australia, an unlocked Xiaomi 14 Pro will cost around $499 from any Xiaomi outlet but $0 for the Xiaomi 14 Pro device when you pair it with a 24-month postpaid plan. While this may look attractive now, you may be paying more for a locked Xiaomi 14 Pro in the long run.
