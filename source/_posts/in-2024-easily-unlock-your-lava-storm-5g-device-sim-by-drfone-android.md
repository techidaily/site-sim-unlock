Their representatives are trained to assist in such situations and can verify your identity before providing the PUK code. Be prepared to answer security questions and provide relevant account details to ensure a smooth process.

![customer service](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/02/unlock-sim-without-puk-code-02.jpg)

Here’s what you’ll need:

- **Verify your identity.**Answer the security questions or provide the requested account details to confirm that you’re the authorized user.
- **Receive your PUK code/new SIM card.** Once verified, the representative will provide you with your PUK code. Be sure to write it down in a secure location for future reference. They might offer you a replaced SIM card if no PUK codes exist.
- **Unlock your SIM card.**Enter the PUK code on your phone following the specific instructions provided by your carrier. This typically involves entering the PUK code followed by a new PIN.

### 9\. Mobile Unlocking app

Another really reliable Android app that unlocks your device's SIM. This one has been around for quite a while and with a few bug fixes it has grown to become a very reliable app. There is just one constant complaint that we've noted with the app- most people say the unlocking service is too expensive. It has however been used by a lot of people and can unlock just about any device as long as you have the IMEI number.
