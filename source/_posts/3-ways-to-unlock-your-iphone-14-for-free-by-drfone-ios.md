## The Ultimate Guide to Unlocking Your Apple iPhone 14 on MetroPCS

If you own an iPhone that is MetroPCS-branded, the carrier will probably lock it, making it impossible to use a SIM from another carrier on the Apple iPhone 14 device. Therefore, you will have to unlock iPhone MetroPCS for this purpose.

Many people find it difficult to unlock their MetroPCS iPhone and resort to buying a new phone altogether to use it with another service provider. In this article, you will learn how to use the MetroPCS unlock phones feature with three different methods. So, let’s get started!

### 1\. Calling MetroPCS to Unlock Phones

The first and most straightforward method to carrier unlocks MetroPCS phone is to call the company. But before you do that, make sure whether your phone has GSM/LTE or CDMA technology. Check for the small slot on the side of your phone to see whether there’s a SIM.

If your phone does not have a SIM, it uses CDMA technology. You will have to call your new carrier company and request them to unlock your phone in such a case. However, if you find a SIM card, your phone works on GSM or LTE and can easily be unlocked by contacting MetroPCS customer care.

Here’s how to do that:

**Step 1**

Call 1-888-863-8768 to reach the MetroPCS customer service, and request a MetroPCS network unlock code.

**Step 2**

They might ask you to provide your phone number, name on the MetroPCS account, email address, and PIN. Therefore, keep this information at hand.

**Step 3**

They will send you a confirmation email within 2 to 3 business days, containing the MetroPCS unlock code and instructions on how to use it.

**Step 4**

The instructions involve turning off your phone, inserting the SIM card of the new carrier, and entering the provided code when prompted. And that’s how you unlock your MetroPCS phone for free via the official method.

The downside of this method is again the time consumption. You have to call and wait for your turn, answer a bunch of questions, and wait for several days before receiving a confirmation email. If you want to save all this time, you can unlock iPhone MetroPCS for free using a more time-efficient method, i.e., using an unlock tool like [Dr.Fone – Sim Unlock](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/iphone-unlock/).

### 2\. Unlock iPhone MetroPCS with an Unlock Tool

It is reliable, foolproof, and secure.

**Step 3**

Once your device has been unlocked, the app will ask you to restart your phone, after which the Apple iPhone 14 device will be permanently unlocked, and you can use any network's sim card on it.

### Troubleshooting Issues

It is possible that when you use the Apple iPhone 14 device Unlock app, some error messages might pop up. Here are the common errors and their solutions:

1. If you get the following errors:

- Data corrupted
- Server not responding
- No internet connection
- Failure to apply to unlock

Turn off your Wi-Fi, and move to a place that has strong signals. Now turn your Wi-Fi back on and try again.

2. If you get the “Data not recognized” errors, you’ll have to unroot your phone. For this, search for the unroot guide for your smartphone’s specific model and follow the instructions.

3. For the “System maintenance error,” wait for a few hours and then try again, as the system might be going through maintenance and won’t process the unlock.

## FAQs on MetroPCS Unlock Phone

Here are some frequently asked questions by our customers:

### Q. What is the MetroPCS unlock code?

The company provides a MetroPCS unlock code, which is used to unlock your MetroPCS-locked iPhone. Upon requesting the code, you will receive it via email and instructions on how to use it. All you have to do is follow those instructions and enter the MetroPCS unlock code when prompted to unlock your Apple iPhone 14 and use it with other carriers.

### Q. How can I tell if My Apple iPhone 14 is eligible to unlock if it's MetroPCS?

MetroPCS has some eligibility requirements to unlock your Apple iPhone 14. The criteria to be eligible are:

1. You must have purchased your Apple iPhone 14 from MetroPCS.
2. The device to be unlocked must not be stolen, lost, or blocked.
3. The device must be activated for 180 days to be eligible to be unlocked.

If you fulfill these requirements, your phone is eligible to be unlocked.

### Q. What do I do if I unlock My Apple iPhone 14 and now my SIM card doesn't work?

If you get this error, it means that the SIM card you have inserted into the Apple iPhone 14 device is not supported by the activation policy assigned by the activation server. To solve this issue, you need a SIM from a supported carrier and request them to unlock the iPhone.

### Conclusion

If you own an iPhone locked by MetroPCS but want to use another carrier’s SIM on it, you will have to unlock your phone first. There are several ways to do so. You can either do it the official way by calling MetroPCS and requesting a MetroPCS unlock code, or you can do it easily by using a third-party unlock tool like Dr.Fone. Then there’s a third way that involves using a device unlock app.

While all 3 ways are easy, they require time and patience, except for Dr.Fone, which lets you unlock your Apple iPhone 14 within 5 minutes. So, save your time and money and go for a reliable and foolproof way to unlock iPhone MetroPCS, the Dr.Fone way!
