## Part 3. Benefits of Using Android SIM Unlock Code Generator

There are several benefits of using Android SIM unlock code generator. Some of these benefits are:

- **1\. Freedom to choose your carrier**

When your phone is carrier locked, you are limited to using only the carrier that the phone is locked to. This can be a problem if you travel frequently or want to switch to a different carrier. By unlocking your phone's SIM card, you will be able to use any carrier's SIM card, giving you the freedom to choose the carrier that best suits your needs.

- **2\. Cost savings**

By unlocking your phone's SIM card, you can save money on roaming charges when traveling. Instead of paying expensive roaming charges, you can simply purchase a local SIM card and use it in your unlocked phone. This can save you a lot of money in the long run.

- **3\. Resale value**

An unlocked phone has a higher resale value than a carrier-locked phone. This is because an unlocked phone can be used with any carrier's SIM card, making it more attractive to buyers.

- **4\. No need to buy a new phone**

If you want to switch to a different carrier, you may be tempted to buy a new phone that is compatible with that carrier. However, by unlocking your phone's SIM card, you can use your existing phone with any carrier's SIM card, saving you the cost of buying a new phone.

### 2\. IMEI Analyzer

![imei analyzer logo](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/05/imei-analyzer-logo.jpg)

Aside from just allowing you to check whether the IMEI number provided is valid, [IMEI Analyzer](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.vndnguyen.imeianalyze&hl=en) will also provide you with data about your device based on the IMEI (International Mobile Equipment Identity) number . It also has an additional feature that calculates the IMEI number when you enter only 15 digits. It also analyses the IMEI number providing you with different information about the number itself such as the Serial Number (SNR), Type Allocation Code (TAC), Reporting body identifier, Final Assembly Code, and Check Digit.

By using an IMEI Analyzer, users can validate the IMEI number, check if the Realme 12 5G device is blacklisted or stolen, and obtain information about the Realme 12 5G device's brand, model, and specifications. This can be particularly useful when buying a used mobile device or trying to recover a lost or stolen one. Some IMEI analyzers may also provide additional features such as warranty status checks, carrier information, and SIM lock status.
