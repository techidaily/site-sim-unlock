In today's world, smartphones have become an essential part of our lives. They offer a lot of convenience, but sometimes they can be a bit of a hassle. One of the biggest headaches that smartphone users face is carrier locking. This is when your phone is locked to a specific carrier, and you are unable to use it with any other carrier's SIM card.

If you've tried Googling for solutions, you'll realize it may take a long time to find a reliable solution. In effect, what you're looking for is an Android [SIM unlock](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/unlock-android-screen/) code generator to provide you with a free unlock code. Some free solutions may have hidden costs, so you must be careful in choosing the right Android [sim network to unlock pin software](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/unlock-android-screen/). Here are seven free Android unlock code generators to consider.

## Part 1. What is Android SIM Unlock Code Generator?

## Part 2. How Does Android SIM Unlock Code Generator Work?

To use the Android SIM unlock code generator, you will need to download and install the software on your computer. Once installed, you will need to connect your Android phone to the computer using a USB cable. The software will then detect your phone and check if it is eligible for unlocking.

If your phone is eligible for unlocking, the software will generate an unlock code. You will then need to enter this code into your phone's keypad to unlock the SIM card. Once the SIM card is unlocked, you will be able to use your phone with any carrier's SIM card.

## Part 3. Benefits of Using Android SIM Unlock Code Generator

There are several benefits of using Android SIM unlock code generator. Some of these benefits are:

- **1\. Freedom to choose your carrier**

When your phone is carrier locked, you are limited to using only the carrier that the phone is locked to. This can be a problem if you travel frequently or want to switch to a different carrier. By unlocking your phone's SIM card, you will be able to use any carrier's SIM card, giving you the freedom to choose the carrier that best suits your needs.

- **2\. Cost savings**

By unlocking your phone's SIM card, you can save money on roaming charges when traveling. Instead of paying expensive roaming charges, you can simply purchase a local SIM card and use it in your unlocked phone. This can save you a lot of money in the long run.

- **3\. Resale value**

An unlocked phone has a higher resale value than a carrier-locked phone. This is because an unlocked phone can be used with any carrier's SIM card, making it more attractive to buyers.

- **4\. No need to buy a new phone**

If you want to switch to a different carrier, you may be tempted to buy a new phone that is compatible with that carrier. However, by unlocking your phone's SIM card, you can use your existing phone with any carrier's SIM card, saving you the cost of buying a new phone.

## Part 1: Asking the Carrier to Unlock

One of the best options is getting in touch with the carrier and asking them to unlock the SIM locked phone. For that to happen, it is important to first know whether the phone is SIM locked and then whether the phone can be unlocked and if you are eligible to unlock the phone. There is an eligibility clause in contract for Smartphones bought on contract and if a specific time period is not up yet, then a termination fee is required to be paid by the user to break the contract in order to be able to use any SIM on the OnePlus Nord CE 3 5G device after getting the unlock code.

**_Pros_**

• This is the best way to unlock carrier locked devices.

• This is legal and everything happens based on the clause mentioned in the contract.

**_Cons  
_**

• Sometimes, even the network providers or carrier refuse to unlock Smartphone

• There is a certain time period which if not over yet, unlocking the phone would require termination fee.

## Part 2: Professional Reputable Smartphone Unlock Service

If you have tried out contacting the carrier and there is no way the carrier is unlocking your phone, you can opt for professional unlock service which could be of help. But finding such a professional service is not an easy task. There are some sites and service providers which require the IMEI number of the phone to create unlock codes. IMEI number of the phone is given to the professional SIM unlock service post which, they generate a special character combination which can be used to get the cell phone out of network restrictions. So, the phone can be unlocked remotely by using the special remote unlock codes.

Sometimes, the professional Smartphone service providers even ask for the phone to be sent to them to get the phone unlocked.

**_Pros_**

• This method could be opted as a last resort if there is no help from the carrier.

• Professional and reputable Smartphone unlock service providers tend to serve the purpose as they are specialized in this task.

• There are not many obligations involved.

**_Cons  
_**

• This might attract legal actions against the user.

• It is very difficult to find such professional Smartphone unlock service providers.

• Reliability on such service providers is also another factor which requires attention.

## Part 3: Unlock Android to Use Any SIM via Doctor SIM

Compared to connecting with your network provider, choosing an unlocking software may be a quicker and easier way. [Doctor SIM](https://www.doctorsim.com/gb-en/?scp) could be a good option. Let me introduce more about it.

**_Pros_**

- Providing more than 6 million unlocks securely in 15 years.
- Providing permanent remote service.
- Promising a refund if the unlock fails.

**_Cons_**

- Sometimes it may need even seven days.
- A 100% success rate cannot be guaranteed.

## Conclusion

There are many different methods to SIM unlock your Android device, however, they all have some disadvantages. Doctor SIM. provides fast and amazing solution for iPhone SIM lock. And we are trying hard to launch Android version. Stay tuned!
