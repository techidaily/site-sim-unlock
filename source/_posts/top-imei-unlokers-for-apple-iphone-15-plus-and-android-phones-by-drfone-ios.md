## 4 Best Methods to Unlock Apple iPhone 15 Plus

Following are three methods to unlock Apple iPhone 15 Plus

### Method 1: Contact your carrier for unlock code

When a customer signs a contract with a big cell phone company for a certain amount of time, they often get a discount on a device. Because of this, the Apple iPhone 15 Plus device comes with a controller lock so customers can only use it on their network.

You can leave without paying anything if your agreement with the company is over. You must meet the following requirements before you can unlock your Apple iPhone 15 Plus:

![sim unlock pin](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/12/how-to-unlock-iphone-11-12-4.jpg)

- First, the Apple iPhone 15 Plus device must be legal. It means the Apple iPhone 15 Plus device has not been reported as lost, stolen, or connected to a crime.
- Then you shouldn't have any debts in your bank account.
- If you signed a contract in exchange for a lower price upfront, you would have to wait until your contract ended (usually 24 months) or pay the remaining balance if you bought your phone on a payment plan.

Note: the unlocking process is different for each company.

**How to unlock the Apple iPhone 15 Plus locked by AT&T**

First, you need to know that AT&T limits how many devices a customer can unlock in a given year. Customers can unlock up to five devices per year if their account is in great condition.

**AT&T Unlocking security question**

- Last four digits of the account holder's social security number
- AT&T passcode of the registered account owner if they have an online account.
- The IMEI number of the Apple iPhone 15 Plus is 11/12. The serial number of the Apple iPhone 15 Plus device is called the IMEI number. You can find it on the original packaging, under the battery, and on the back of some models, by dialing #06 or navigating to Settings > General > About.

**How to unlock the Apple iPhone 15 Plus locked by T-Mobile**

T-Mobile has set several standards that should be matched to complete an unlock request.

- The phone must have at least $50 worth of recharges paid for on prepaid plans.
- If you meet the above prerequisites, you can unlock an Apple iPhone 15 Plus carrier locked by a T-Mobile device by calling customer service at 611 from the Apple iPhone 15 Plus device you want to unlock.
- Make sure you have ALL of the following information on tips when you call:

1. The main account holder's phone number
