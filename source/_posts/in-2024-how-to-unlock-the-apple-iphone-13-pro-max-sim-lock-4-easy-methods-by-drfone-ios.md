### How to unlock the Apple iPhone 13 Pro Max locked by Verizon

To prevent theft and other types of fraud, Verizon locks new devices to only work on the Verizon network. The company has different rules for unlocking prepaid and post-pay devices, as well as special rules for people in the military who are distributed.

"Unlocking" a device means turning off Software that would stop a customer from trying to use a device made for one carrier's network on another carrier's network. Due to different technologies, a Verizon Wireless device that has been unlocked may only work partially on another carrier's network.

If you buy a phone from Verizon, it will be locked for 60 days after you buy it. If you buy a device from one of their authorized retailers, it will be locked for 60 days after it is activated.

After 60 days, the lock will be taken off itself unless the Apple iPhone 13 Pro Max device is found to be stolen or was bought through fraud. After 60 days, their phones are never locked again.

After activation, devices you buy from Verizon and some devices you buy from one of their authorized retailers are locked for 60 days. After 60 days, the lock will be taken off itself unless the Apple iPhone 13 Pro Max device is found to be stolen or was bought through fraud. After the first 60 days, their phones are locked, but after that, they never lock them again.

**Military Personnel Placement Unlocking Policy**

If you are in the military and a Verizon Wireless customer, in case, you get orders to move outside of the Verizon Coverage Area. The company will unlock your device and stop your service if you ask, even if it has only been 60 days since you bought it.

## Part 3: How to unlock T Mobile iPhone via T Mobile carrier

If you want to unlock, say for example, a T Mobile iPhone 5s without a third-party tool, but by contacting the carrier directly, you can do that as well though that process would have a lot more restrictions and take a lot longer. Requesting carriers to T Mobile unlock iPhone 5s is becoming more and more of an outdated concept in the face of far easier third-party softwares. However, contacting the carriers directly is also a legitimate means. So read on to find out how to unlock T Mobile iPhone 5s via T Mobile carrier.

### How to unlock T Mobile iPhone 5s via T Mobile carrier

#### **Step 1:** Eligibility

When you try to unlock T Mobile iPhone 5s directly through the carrier you are faced with a lot of restrictions and verification processes. Hence, to keep yourself from wasting your own time, you should go and read their page on eligibility to make sure you pass the test. Follow this link: support.t-mobile.com/docs/DOC-1588.

#### **Step 2:** Contact

Next you simply need to go to their Customer Care page and file a request for the unlock code. Follow the following link to contact them: <https://support.t-mobile.com/community/contact-us>. However you should bear in mind that they can reject any application at all.

With that your Apple iPhone 13 Pro Max is now completely unlock activated! You're free to use it as you please now.

In this article we've explained how to unlock T Mobile Apple iPhone 13 Pro Max using DoctorSIM - SIM Unlock Service, and how to unlock T Mobile iPhone 5s using the T Mobile carrier itself. While both of them are perfectly legitimate means of unlocking your Apple iPhone 13 Pro Maxs, I personally lean more towards the DoctorSIM solution as they don't have any pesky eligibility criteria, nor do they make you wait long. They are a 100% solution, especially considering they're a third-party tool which makes them less biased as they don't have an incentive to keep you from unlocking. Well, we hope this helped and hopefully now you have a T Mobile unlock iPhone!
