### Method 1: Contacting Your Carrier’s Customer Service

The most straightforward approach is contacting your mobile carrier’s customer service department directly. Their representatives are trained to assist in such situations and can verify your identity before providing the PUK code. Be prepared to answer security questions and provide relevant account details to ensure a smooth process.

![customer service](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/02/unlock-sim-without-puk-code-02.jpg)

Here’s what you’ll need:

- **Ready your information.** Prepare your account number, phone number, and any other relevant details your carrier might require for verification.
- **Find the best contact option for you.** Most carriers offer multiple options like phone calls, online chat, or visiting a physical store. Opt for the method that best suits your preference and availability.
- **Prepare a written report of what happened.** Clearly state that you’ve locked your SIM card by entering an incorrect PIN and have lost your PUK code.
- **Verify your identity.**Answer the security questions or provide the requested account details to confirm that you’re the authorized user.
- **Receive your PUK code/new SIM card.** Once verified, the representative will provide you with your PUK code. Be sure to write it down in a secure location for future reference. They might offer you a replaced SIM card if no PUK codes exist.
- **Unlock your SIM card.**Enter the PUK code on your phone following the specific instructions provided by your carrier. This typically involves entering the PUK code followed by a new PIN.

### Method 2: Retrieving the PUK Code Through Your Carrier’s Website

Many mobile carriers offer self-service options on their websites, allowing you to manage your account and access information independently. If your carrier provides this functionality, you can retrieve your PUK code online without contacting customer service. This way, you’ll learn **how to unlock SIM cards without PUK numbers**.

Here’s how it might work:

- **Step 1:** Navigate to the secure section of your account using your login credentials. For example, this is what you can see from the JIO website:

![jio website](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/02/unlock-sim-without-puk-code-03.jpg)

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
- **Step 2:** Different carriers have varying website layouts, so refer to their specific instructions or search features to find the dedicated section for retrieving PUK codes.
- **Step 3:** Similar to contacting customer service, you might need to verify your account ownership through security questions or other verification methods.
- **Step 4:** Once verified, your PUK code should be displayed on the screen or sent to your registered email address.

Remember, these steps are general guidelines, and specific procedures may vary depending on your carrier. Consult your carrier’s website or contact customer service for the most accurate and up-to-date information.

By following these official routes, you can safely and securely bypass the PUK code hurdle and regain access to your vital mobile services. Stay tuned for Part 2, where you’ll explore alternative unlocking methods for those who prefer a different approach.

## Part 2: Unlocking SIM Cards With the Help of a Third-Party Tool

While official methods through your carrier are always recommended, some situations might arise where you’ll need to learn **how to unlock SIM cards without PUK** **codes.** Third-party tools like [Wondershare Dr.Fone](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/drfone-toolkit/) offer an alternative approach in such cases.

## Android Unlock Code: Sim Unlock Your Honor 90 Phone and Remove Locked Screen

When you buy a phone, your matter of concern is whether to buy a locked phone or an unlocked Phone. Locked phones may look much safer to you, but they are very inconvenient when it comes to normal use. These phones are bound to one carrier only, which is their biggest disadvantage. At the same time, unlocked phones save you from this hassle.

If you’ve bought a locked phone and facing problems, you need not worry as there are multiple ways to unlock your phone. For that, this article has provided the solution to your issue in the most intelligible way.

## Part 1: Difference between Unlocking, Rooting, and Jailbreaking

This part of the article shall differ from three very similar terms, Unlocking, Rooting, and Jailbreaking, to clear your confusion.

### Unlocking

![sim unlock](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/09/sim-unlock.jpg)

Unlocking a phone means making it compatible with other SIM carriers. An unlocked phone is not pinned to a single SIM carrier; rather, it lets you switch carriers. SIM Card lets your phone connect to a specific network, but it depends on your phone's hardware compatibility. If it's not compatible with a specific network, then nothing can change that.

To unlock your phone, you have to enter a specific code to remove the restrictions of the network. However, there are ways to unlock your phone without granting permission from the network.

### Rooting (for Android)

![androi root](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/09/root-android.jpg)

[Rooting a phone](https://drfone.wondershare.com/root/reasons-to-root-android.html) means gaining “root access” on another phone. **This process works for Android only.** However, it can also be used on some specific Linux-based devices. Root access allows you to do almost everything on the phone you’ve gained access to, like installing or uninstalling applications or changing the settings.

Root access is not all fun, and games as this process will lead you to the security architect of your operating system, which will be hard to deal with even if you're a professional. So, it’s important to be careful with this process, else you will have to bear the consequences.

### Jailbreaking (for iOS)

![iphone Jailbreak](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/09/iphone-jailbreak.jpg)

[Jailbreaking a device](https://drfone.wondershare.com/guide/how-to-jailbreak-ios-on-windows.html) means removing all the restrictions on that device that its manufacturer's applied. **This process works specifically for Apple devices.** It lets you bypass the limitations and restrictions, so you can modify the software your way and make changes to the default program. It is also considered free booting, and Apple or any other company does not approve of it.

In summary, unlocking is primarily about freeing a device from carrier restrictions, rooting is specific to Android devices and involves gaining administrative access, while jailbreaking is specific to iOS devices and involves bypassing Apple's restrictions for more customization. All these processes come with potential risks and may void warranties, so users should carefully consider the implications before proceeding.

It is advisable to always go for the safest method, unlocking your phone. Rooting and Jailbreaking are risky security exploitations that can cause serious problems.

## Part 2: Is it Legally Allowed to Unlock Your Honor 90?

Every country has its own rules and regulations. Similarly, laws regarding unlocking your phones are different in different countries. However, after sessions of deliberations and consultations, the US has declared it legal to unlock your phone.

In order to legally unlock your phone, you must make sure your phone service contracts, payments, and dues are cleared. You must be the sole owner of your phone. Once your phone is eligible and falls under the requirements, you will be given an “Unlock Code” to proceed further.

## Part 5: Tip to Avoid the SIM Lock Issue

In order to avoid the SIM Lock issue, it is advisable to use unlocked phones. This will save you from long-term hassle as you will have the freedom to switch carriers and SIM cards whenever you like. On the other hand, if we talk about locked phones, they’re expensive and a headache to deal with because of the requirements and problems they come with.

If you're concerned about a dual-SIM phone, then you can have one SIM pinned to a good quality carrier. The other SIM can be temporary and cheap. This is an amazing option for you if you're traveling, as you'll have the flexibility to change carriers for the temporary SIM no matter wherever you are.

## Conclusion

As a crux, an unlocked phone is a better choice than a locked phone. We would personally advise you to go for unlocked phones as this will save your time and money. You will have much more freedom and flexibility for changing between SIM and SIM carriers. Whereas on the locked phones, you will be bound to one SIM. So, the next time you decide to buy a phone, give this article a read again.
