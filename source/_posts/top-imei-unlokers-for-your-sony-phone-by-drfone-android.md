### 2\. Unlock Base

Website URL: [https://www.unlockbase.com/wholesale-phone-unlocking](https://www.unlockbase.com/wholesale-phone-unlocking)

This service will unlock almost all devices, both Android and iPhone. It is also very fast and reliable. But perhaps the best feature of this service is that you can be aware of just how much you will have to spend to unlock your device long before you place the order.

To use the service, simply go to the main home page and check on the table provided how long it will take for your device to be unlocked and how much you have to pay. If you are happy with both estimates. Choose to unlock from the main menu and then proceed to select your device.

Once you have selected the Sony Xperia 5 V device, enter the IMEI code, your email address, your country, and the network you are on. Then click on "Proceed to check out". Make payment and then wait for the assigned time for the [sim network unlock pin](https://drfone.wondershare.com/unlock/unlock-samsung-sim-network-unlock-pin.html) to be sent to the email address you provided.

### 3\. iPhone IMEI

Website URL: [https://iphoneimei.net/](https://appleiphoneunlock.uk/network/Special%20Services/Activation%20Lock?aff=wondershare)

This one is perhaps the easiest to use. It offers two services, one to check your iPhone's IMEI and the other to use the IMEI number to unlock the iPhone.

To use the service, select the “Unlock iPhone” on the homepage. Then select the model and the network the iPhone is locked to. Click “Unlock” to

continue.  You will be sent to a checkout page where you can pay the amount. The codes will be sent to the email address you provided at checkout.

### 4\. Doctor SIM

This is another website that can easily unlock just about any device model. It also offers an IMEI checker service as well as a lot of other helpful information about phone unlocking IMEI numbers and other issues related to devising unlocking.

To use it, click on "Unlock your Phone" in the main menu and select your device from the drop-down menu. You should see the amount you have to pay to unlock the Sony Xperia 5 V device. Click on "Unlock your phone now" to continue.

In the next window, select your country and network provider and enter the phone's IMEI number and other information. Choose a payment method and then continue to check out. You will receive the codes at the email address you provided.

### 5\. Mobile Unlocked

Website URL: [https://www.mobileunlocked.com/](https://www.mobileunlocked.com/)

This is another service that will also provide you with phone unlock codes at a price. Just like the others, we have seen it is very easy to use and supports all devices.

To use it, select the “Unlock” option from the main menu and then choose your device's model from the drop-down menu.  Next, provide your device's details and then proceed to pay for the service and provide your name, email address, and IMEI number.

Once you click on “unlock now” all you have to do is wait the stipulated time for the codes to be sent to you.

### 6\. Cell Unlocker

Website URL: [http://www.cellunlocker.net/](http://www.cellunlocker.net/)

This service will also offer to unlock services at a price. The service unlocks all devices, including the iPhone, and they pride themselves on providing excellent service in the shortest period.  They also offer a 100% guarantee that they offer this service at the lowest price in the market.

To use this service, select "Unlock your Device" from the main menu and then select your device model from the list provided. There is a lot of information to read through, but when you scroll down a bit, you should be able to enter the Sony Xperia 5 V device's information and then click on "look for code"

You will be directed to a payment page where you can make your payment.  The codes will be sent to you in a few days.
