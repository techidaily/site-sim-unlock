It enables you to input the ICCID code and access a wider range of carrier options. This method is particularly useful if you're looking for a seamless and reliable way to configure your Apple iPhone 14 Pro's network settings. Below, we have gone through the steps of using an R-SIM to input the ICCID code:

- **Step 1:** Begin by inserting the R-SIM card into your Apple iPhone 14 Pro's SIM card tray. Ensure it is properly positioned and securely placed. For R-SIM versions starting from 14 and above, there's no need to manually dial a code. Upon inserting the R-SIM card, the Apple iPhone 14 Pro device will automatically prompt you with a menu.
- **Step 2:** However, for earlier versions, open the Call app on your Apple iPhone 14 Pro. Dial 50057672\*00# and initiate the call. This action will trigger the appearance of the R-SIM menu. Once the R-SIM menu is visible, select the option labeled "Edit ICCID."

## Part 1: What Should You Do Before Apple iPhone 14 Pro SIM Unlock?

Before unlocking your Apple iPhone 14 Pro from the carrier, you should fulfill the following criteria.

### 1\. No Due Before Unlocking

When iPhone users sign contracts with a giant cell phone company for a certain amount of time, they often get a discount on a device. Because of this, the Apple iPhone 14 Pro device comes with a controller lock so customers can only use it on their network.

So, if you've paid off your contract or bought your Apple iPhone 14 Pro without a subsidy, it's perfectly legal to unlock it. But if you're still paying off your contract, you still need to own the Apple iPhone 14 Pro fully, so you should confirm with your carrier before unlocking it.

### 2\. You Should Buy It for More Than the Time Limit in the Contract

You can leave without paying anything if your agreement with the company is over. If you signed a contract in exchange for a lower price upfront, you would have to wait until your contract ended (usually 24 months) or pay the remaining balance if you bought your phone on a payment plan.

### Examples: Requirements of Sim Unlock of T-Mobile/EE/AT&T

T-Mobile, EE, and AT&T have common requirements before you can unlock your Apple iPhone 14 Pro.

- It has to be legal. It means the Apple iPhone 14 Pro device has not been reported as lost, stolen, or linked to a crime.
- Your bank account shouldn't have any debts.
- If you signed a contract in exchange for a lower price upfront, you would have to wait until your contract was up (usually 24 months) or pay the remaining balance if you bought your phone on a payment plan.

Apart from the requirements mentioned above, each company has its way of unlocking.

**T-Mobile**
