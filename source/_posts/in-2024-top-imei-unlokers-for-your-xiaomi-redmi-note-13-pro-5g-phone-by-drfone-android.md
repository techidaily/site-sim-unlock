## Part 6: The downside of an unlocked Xiaomi Redmi Note 13 Pro 5G

Are you thinking "Well, why can't I just buy an unlocked Xiaomi Redmi Note 13 Pro 5G in the first place?" right about now? Well, you can but think of the amount of money it will cost you.

For example, in Australia, an unlocked Xiaomi Redmi Note 13 Pro 5G will cost around $499 from any Xiaomi outlet but $0 for the Xiaomi Redmi Note 13 Pro 5G device when you pair it with a 24-month postpaid plan. While this may look attractive now, you may be paying more for a locked Xiaomi Redmi Note 13 Pro 5G in the long run.

## Conclusion

Now that you know the three ways of unlocking your Xiaomi Redmi Note 13 Pro 5G, all you need to do is find one that is most compatible with you. Just remember to think of everything through and carefully. Most importantly, if you have a locked device, always seek advice from your carrier to see if this is possible.
