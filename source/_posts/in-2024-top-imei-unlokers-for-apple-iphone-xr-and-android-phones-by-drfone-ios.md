This is an alternative means by which you can AT&T unlock iPhone. It is a tad more cumbersome and may take a little more time, but is another legitimate means you could opt for should you wish to do so. This is done by directly getting in contact with your Carrier. If you already know that your carrier is AT&T, you can contact them directly and get your Apple iPhone XR unlocked as follows:

#### **Step 1:** Go to their Site and Contact them

1\. Go to [https://www.att.com/deviceunlock/?#/](https://www.att.com/deviceunlock/?#/) first. This is the official location whereby you can contact them.

2\. The page will list out certain eligibility requirements. You have to read and agree to them before clicking 'Continue.'

![unlock att iphone via att carrier](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2016/10/14769325349486.jpg)

3\. Next, you have to fill up the Request Form, including details about your Wireless number.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![fill the form to unlock iphone att](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2016/10/14769326985388.jpg)

#### **Step 2:** Email confirmation

1\. You'll receive the unlock request number via email.

2\. You need to click on the provided link within 24 hours in order for your unlock request to be officially accepted.

#### **Step 3:** Response

1\. You should hear back from AT&T within 2 days.

2\. If your request has been successful, they'll send you further instructions about how to unlock your Apple iPhone XR.

### Requirements

However, AT&T has the right to dismiss anyone's request based on several requirements and criteria, so your application may yet be either rejected or you may have to go through further steps. It is a good idea to go through their requirements before you fill their form.

1\. The obvious requirement is that your Apple iPhone XR must be locked to AT&T, else you should go to the relevant carrier page.

2\. You iPhone couldn't have been reported as either lost or stolen.

3\. No record of it having been linked to any criminal or fraudulent activities.

4\. All termination fees have been paid in full, and all the other iPhone installment plans, etc, have been completed.

5\. After upgrading iPhone you must wait 14 days before you're eligible for unlock.

Finding out how to unlock AT&T iPhone can be harrowing if you don't know where to look, especially because performing the unlock can be so crucial for many people in order to access other carriers.

Both the options mentioned above offer a legitimate means by which you can AT&T unlock your Apple iPhone XR, whether done without a SIM card or by contacting the AT&T carrier.

However, going by personal experience the DoctorSIM alternative offers a much smoother, efficient and quicker alternative to contacting the AT&T carriers. It is also more secure because if you are going via the carrier without a SIM card then you'll need to back up your Apple iPhone XR, then delete and restore it as well (for security measures). This isn't just a time consuming process, but it can also prove to be risky. Furthermore, AT&T has a lot of checks and requisites in place which can keep your Apple iPhone XR from being unlocked, and even if you do pass the requisites it's still a time-consuming process which may still be rejected as AT&T has final say. As such, going via DoctorSIM gives you complete agency and conveniently AT&T unlocks iPhone without any data loss, through a simple 3 step process.

## The Ultimate Guide to Unlocking Your Apple iPhone XR on MetroPCS

If you own an iPhone that is MetroPCS-branded, the carrier will probably lock it, making it impossible to use a SIM from another carrier on the Apple iPhone XR device. Therefore, you will have to unlock iPhone MetroPCS for this purpose.

Many people find it difficult to unlock their MetroPCS iPhone and resort to buying a new phone altogether to use it with another service provider. In this article, you will learn how to use the MetroPCS unlock phones feature with three different methods. So, let’s get started!

### 1\. Calling MetroPCS to Unlock Phones

The first and most straightforward method to carrier unlocks MetroPCS phone is to call the company. But before you do that, make sure whether your phone has GSM/LTE or CDMA technology. Check for the small slot on the side of your phone to see whether there’s a SIM.

If your phone does not have a SIM, it uses CDMA technology. You will have to call your new carrier company and request them to unlock your phone in such a case. However, if you find a SIM card, your phone works on GSM or LTE and can easily be unlocked by contacting MetroPCS customer care.

Here’s how to do that:

**Step 1**

Call 1-888-863-8768 to reach the MetroPCS customer service, and request a MetroPCS network unlock code.

**Step 2**

They might ask you to provide your phone number, name on the MetroPCS account, email address, and PIN. Therefore, keep this information at hand.

**Step 3**

**Step 4**

The instructions involve turning off your phone, inserting the SIM card of the new carrier, and entering the provided code when prompted. And that’s how you unlock your MetroPCS phone for free via the official method.

The downside of this method is again the time consumption. You have to call and wait for your turn, answer a bunch of questions, and wait for several days before receiving a confirmation email. If you want to save all this time, you can unlock iPhone MetroPCS for free using a more time-efficient method, i.e., using an unlock tool like [Dr.Fone – Sim Unlock](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/iphone-unlock/).

If you have any problems during the sim unlocking process, you can follow [the Sim unlock guide](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/iphone-unlock/) in detail to carrier unlock the MetroPCS phone. This process involves several steps and might seem long, but it hardly takes 5 to 10 minutes. Also, it is the safest and most reliable way with a high success rate to unlock iPhone MetroPCS.

If you’re looking for a way to unlock your MetroPCS phone for free but without going through technical steps, you can use the Apple iPhone XR device Unlock app.

### 3\. Unlock MetroPCS Phone Using an App

The Device Unlock app is automatically installed in MetroPCS-locked phones, so you can easily find it in the apps folder or the MetroPCS folder. However, this app is only compatible with Android devices.

So, if you have an Android phone, follow these steps to unlock it using the Apple iPhone XR device Unlock app:

**Step 1**

Connect your phone to a Wi-Fi internet connection, and launch the Apple iPhone XR device Unlock app.

### Troubleshooting Issues

It is possible that when you use the Apple iPhone XR device Unlock app, some error messages might pop up. Here are the common errors and their solutions:

1. If you get the following errors:

- Data corrupted
- Server not responding
- No internet connection
- Failure to apply to unlock

Turn off your Wi-Fi, and move to a place that has strong signals. Now turn your Wi-Fi back on and try again.

2. If you get the “Data not recognized” errors, you’ll have to unroot your phone. For this, search for the unroot guide for your smartphone’s specific model and follow the instructions.

3. For the “System maintenance error,” wait for a few hours and then try again, as the system might be going through maintenance and won’t process the unlock.

## FAQs on MetroPCS Unlock Phone

Here are some frequently asked questions by our customers:

### Q. What is the MetroPCS unlock code?

The company provides a MetroPCS unlock code, which is used to unlock your MetroPCS-locked iPhone. Upon requesting the code, you will receive it via email and instructions on how to use it. All you have to do is follow those instructions and enter the MetroPCS unlock code when prompted to unlock your Apple iPhone XR and use it with other carriers.

### Q. How can I tell if My Apple iPhone XR is eligible to unlock if it's MetroPCS?

MetroPCS has some eligibility requirements to unlock your Apple iPhone XR. The criteria to be eligible are:

1. You must have purchased your Apple iPhone XR from MetroPCS.
2. The device to be unlocked must not be stolen, lost, or blocked.
3. The device must be activated for 180 days to be eligible to be unlocked.

If you fulfill these requirements, your phone is eligible to be unlocked.

### Q. What do I do if I unlock My Apple iPhone XR and now my SIM card doesn't work?

If you get this error, it means that the SIM card you have inserted into the Apple iPhone XR device is not supported by the activation policy assigned by the activation server. To solve this issue, you need a SIM from a supported carrier and request them to unlock the iPhone.

### Conclusion

If you own an iPhone locked by MetroPCS but want to use another carrier’s SIM on it, you will have to unlock your phone first. There are several ways to do so. You can either do it the official way by calling MetroPCS and requesting a MetroPCS unlock code, or you can do it easily by using a third-party unlock tool like Dr.Fone. Then there’s a third way that involves using a device unlock app.

While all 3 ways are easy, they require time and patience, except for Dr.Fone, which lets you unlock your Apple iPhone XR within 5 minutes. So, save your time and money and go for a reliable and foolproof way to unlock iPhone MetroPCS, the Dr.Fone way!
