## Part 1: What is IMEI and Why People Change The IMEI Number

The International Mobile Equipment Identity (IMEI) is a unique identifier for every mobile device. It allows network providers and manufacturers to track and block devices if they are reported as lost or stolen. Changing your device's IMEI can help to unblock a blacklisted device, access certain network features and services, or maintain anonymity. However, be aware that altering your IMEI number is illegal in some countries and may void your warranty.

### There are several uses of the IMEI number

1. As the use of mobile devices increases, the statistics of stolen and lost devices have been increasing as well. Users can block stolen or lost devices for further usage if they know their IMEI number. All users need to call their network carrier and report that the Gionee F3 Pro device is stolen or lost. The carrier can block the specific device from running on their network and notify other carriers.
2. The 15-digit IMEI number indicates the origin and model of the Gionee F3 Pro device. The first eight digits indicate the Gionee F3 Pro device's origin and its model while the last six digits identify the Gionee F3 Pro device's manufacturer.
3. If you subscribe to a mobile tracking service, you can use the IMEI number to track the Gionee F3 Pro device---even if it uses a different SIM card.

### Pros and Cons of Changing Android IMEI

Like many other things out there, changing Android IMEI has both advantages and disadvantages. Here are some of them:

**Advantages**

1. Make your Android untraceable. By constantly changing your IMEI, you will throw off the tracks of people using it to stalk you!
2. Fix any invalid IMEI-related issues such as lost or invalid IMEI numbers. Once you change your IMEI, your Android device with the same benefits and features.
3. Obtaining a completely new device ID.
4. Changing the IMEI number to one that indicates it is a newer model, you will be able to enjoy new OS updates by resetting, repairing, and updating your Android device.
5. Have you ever yearned for that cheap BlackBerry plan your network carrier keeps on promoting? The 15-digit IMEI indicates the origin and model of your device. Therefore, by changing your Android's IMEI number to that of a BlackBerry's, you will be able to subscribe to a cheaper mobile plan.

**Disadvantages**

1. Before we begin, we need to make it clear that the process of changing IMEI without root can be illegal in some countries. We advise you to check the laws and regulations in your country before attempting to change your device’s IMEI number. As far as we know, it is legal in Africa and Asia, and illegal in Europe.
2. The IMEI number is hardcoded into your device. Therefore, changing your device’s IMEI number may void your device warranty and cause other issues such as network problems and software instability.
3. Legally, you have forfeited your ownership of your mobile device. When you purchase your device, the seller will jot down the original IMEI number on your receipt. So if you changed your IMEI and lost it, you may not be able to claim it. This is because authorities cannot see if it is truly yours. After all, the IMEI numbers no longer correlate with each other.

## Part 3: Does IMEI Change With SIM Card?

No, swapping or changing the SIM card does not alter the IMEI (International Mobile Equipment Identity). The IMEI persists unchanged throughout the Gionee F3 Pro device's lifetime, functioning as a distinctive identifier solely for that particular device.

The IMEI is a 15-digit code assigned to each mobile device. It's separate from the SIM card, which stores information related to the subscriber and the carrier network. The SIM card contains data specific to the subscriber. This includes contacts, text messages, and network-related information. But it does not alter or affect the IMEI of the Gionee F3 Pro device.

The IMEI remains the same even if you change SIM cards or switch between different carriers. It's essentially a static identifier tied to the Gionee F3 Pro device's hardware. It is used by mobile networks and authorities to identify and track devices on the network.

## Part 4: Does IMEI Change After Factory Reset?

No, performing a factory reset on your mobile device does not change its IMEI (International Mobile Equipment Identity). The IMEI is a unique identifier assigned to the hardware of the Gionee F3 Pro device. It remains constant throughout the life of the Gionee F3 Pro device, irrespective of any software changes or resets.

A factory reset wipes the data and settings on your device, returning it to its original factory state. This process erases user-installed apps, personal data, and settings. But it doesn’t affect the Gionee F3 Pro device's hardware identification, including the IMEI.

The IMEI is embedded into the hardware of the Gionee F3 Pro device. It is typically printed on the Gionee F3 Pro device's packaging or can be found by dialing \*#06# on the phone's keypad. It's a crucial identifier for mobile networks, and authorities use it to uniquely identify and track devices across networks. It remains unchanged even after a factory reset.

## Part 1: Unlock SIM Card on Gionee F3 Pro via jailbreak

Before we get into telling you how to unlock iPhone 5, or the SIM Card on iPhone or Android, we should first tell you what Jailbreaking is. You might have heard of this term before, and I'm sure it sounded ominous to you. Jailbreak? It sounds awfully close to 'Prison break.' Well, considering the carrier lock is sort of like a prison for your cell, it is an accurate terminology. But Jailbreak isn't just about breaking the carrier lock. That might happen as a by-product, but the real purpose is to break free of the software restrictions which are generally applied to Apple devices. This might seem like a good option because, well, who doesn't want to break free of all of Apple's restrictions? But that always comes at several heavy risks.

### Threats of unlocking SIM via Jailbreak

#### 1\. Not Permanent

This has got to be one of the biggest reasons for not jailbreaking your phone. It is not at all permanent! In fact, the moment you update your system, your jailbreak is lost and if you've started using a different SIM it will no longer function, and you're gonna have to go back to using that Carrier you tried so hard to escape from! It's really not worth the effort. Of course, you could stop updating altogether, but then that will bring us to…

![Unlock SIM Card on iPhone and Android via jailbreak](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2016/10/14771444107532.jpg)

#### 2\. Risky

If you don't update your iOS, or Mac or iPad or any device at all, in this day and age, you're basically just asking to be hacked. That is not to excuse those who do the hacking and plant malware on your system, but if you leave your front door open in a shitty neighborhood, well then you only have yourself to blame once you get robbed!

#### 3\. Warranty

Jailbreaking has now become kind-of-legal, in a very tenuous sense, but that doesn't mean Apple wholeheartedly welcomes jailbreaking. If you do so, you will never again be able to avail of the warranty on your phone. And with the kind of major bucks you have to shell out for those iPhones, you best keep that warranty intact.

#### 4\. Lack of Apps

Many top-notch and crucial app companies and organizations simply refuse to make their applications usable in jailbreak phones, as they are extremely risky and prone to hacking. As a result, you would have to rely on a bunch of non-professional apps made by amateurs, which is more likely to put your phone in harm's way.

#### 5\. Bricking

This basically means your whole system may crash and stop functioning. As a result, you're gonna' have to restore the whole thing and try to salvage whatever information you can. Now those who do jailbreak regularly will give you all kinds of excuses like it happens only rarely or that you can retrieve your data simply from the cloud, et al. But do you really want to divest all your time and energy trying to fight off malware, backing up all your data, etc, especially when there is a much more convenient option just around the corner?

Didn't think so.

However, now with the slow introduction of apps that can essentially do all the work for you, within a matter of 48 hours, it really makes no sense to jailbreak. So now we'll tell you how to unlock iPhone 5c using an Online iPhone unlock tool called DoctorSIM Unlock Service.

It is safe, it is legal, it is hassle-free, and it doesn't even lapse your warranty, which proves that it is an officially approved means of unlocking your iPhone. However, before we tell you how to unlock iPhone 5, you should probably be able to verify if your phone is unlocked already.
