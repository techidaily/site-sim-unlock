## Part 1: Asking the Carrier to Unlock

One of the best options is getting in touch with the carrier and asking them to unlock the SIM locked phone. For that to happen, it is important to first know whether the phone is SIM locked and then whether the phone can be unlocked and if you are eligible to unlock the phone. There is an eligibility clause in contract for Smartphones bought on contract and if a specific time period is not up yet, then a termination fee is required to be paid by the user to break the contract in order to be able to use any SIM on the Vivo S18 Pro device after getting the unlock code.

**_Cons  
_**

• Sometimes, even the network providers or carrier refuse to unlock Smartphone

### Q3: What is the Master Unlock Code for a Samsung?
