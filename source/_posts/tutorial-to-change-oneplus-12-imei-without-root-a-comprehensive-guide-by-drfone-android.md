## Tutorial to Change OnePlus 12 IMEI without Root: A Comprehensive Guide

As an Android device user, you may have come across a situation where you need to change your device IMEI number. The International Mobile Equipment Identity (IMEI) is a unique 15-digit number assigned to every mobile device, such as smartphones and tablets. This number serves as an identifier, helping to distinguish your device from millions of others. One of the main reasons people want to change their Android IMEI number is to unblock a device that has been blacklisted by their network provider. Other reasons include accessing certain network features and services or maintaining anonymity.

Changing your Android IMEI without root access may seem like a daunting task, but this comprehensive guide will walk you through the process step-by-step. Before proceeding, please note that altering your device's IMEI number can be illegal in some countries, and may void your warranty. Proceed with caution and at your own risk. Get to know **how to change IMEI number** now!

## Part 1: What is IMEI and Why People Change The IMEI Number

The International Mobile Equipment Identity (IMEI) is a unique identifier for every mobile device. It allows network providers and manufacturers to track and block devices if they are reported as lost or stolen. Changing your device's IMEI can help to unblock a blacklisted device, access certain network features and services, or maintain anonymity. However, be aware that altering your IMEI number is illegal in some countries and may void your warranty.

![imei number](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/05/imei-number.jpg)

### There are several uses of the IMEI number

1. As the use of mobile devices increases, the statistics of stolen and lost devices have been increasing as well. Users can block stolen or lost devices for further usage if they know their IMEI number. All users need to call their network carrier and report that the OnePlus 12 device is stolen or lost. The carrier can block the specific device from running on their network and notify other carriers.
2. The 15-digit IMEI number indicates the origin and model of the OnePlus 12 device. The first eight digits indicate the OnePlus 12 device's origin and its model while the last six digits identify the OnePlus 12 device's manufacturer.
3. If you subscribe to a mobile tracking service, you can use the IMEI number to track the OnePlus 12 device---even if it uses a different SIM card.

### Pros and Cons of Changing Android IMEI

Like many other things out there, changing Android IMEI has both advantages and disadvantages. Here are some of them:

**Advantages**

1. Make your Android untraceable. By constantly changing your IMEI, you will throw off the tracks of people using it to stalk you!
2. Fix any invalid IMEI-related issues such as lost or invalid IMEI numbers. Once you change your IMEI, your Android device with the same benefits and features.
3. Obtaining a completely new device ID.
4. Changing the IMEI number to one that indicates it is a newer model, you will be able to enjoy new OS updates by resetting, repairing, and updating your Android device.
5. Have you ever yearned for that cheap BlackBerry plan your network carrier keeps on promoting? The 15-digit IMEI indicates the origin and model of your device. Therefore, by changing your Android's IMEI number to that of a BlackBerry's, you will be able to subscribe to a cheaper mobile plan.

**Disadvantages**

1. Before we begin, we need to make it clear that the process of changing IMEI without root can be illegal in some countries. We advise you to check the laws and regulations in your country before attempting to change your device’s IMEI number. As far as we know, it is legal in Africa and Asia, and illegal in Europe.
2. The IMEI number is hardcoded into your device. Therefore, changing your device’s IMEI number may void your device warranty and cause other issues such as network problems and software instability.
3. Legally, you have forfeited your ownership of your mobile device. When you purchase your device, the seller will jot down the original IMEI number on your receipt. So if you changed your IMEI and lost it, you may not be able to claim it. This is because authorities cannot see if it is truly yours. After all, the IMEI numbers no longer correlate with each other.

## Part 2: How to Find the IMEI on an Android? (5 Ways)

In this part, we will walk you through the various methods on how to find the IMEI on your Android device.

### Method 1: Locate IMEI through the Settings App

One of the easiest ways to find the IMEI number on your Android device is through the Settings app. Follow these simple steps:

![find imei number through settiings](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/05/locate-imei-through-the-settings-app.jpg)

- **Step 1:** Open the "Settings" app on your Android device.

- **Step 3:** Tap on "Status" or "IMEI information".
- **Step 4:** You will see your IMEI number displayed on the screen. Note this down or take a screenshot for reference.

### Method 2: Use the Dialer App

Another quick method to find the IMEI number is by using the dialer app on your Android smartphone. Here's how:

![find imei number 06](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/05/06-imei-number.jpg)

- **Step 1:** Open the "Phone" app or "Dialer" app on your Android device.
- **Step 2:** Dial \*#06# on the keypad.
- **Step 3:** The IMEI number will be displayed on the screen. Note it down or take a screenshot for reference.

### Method 3: Check the OnePlus 12 device Packaging or Receipt

If you still have the original packaging or receipt for your Android device, you may find the IMEI number printed on it. Look for a label or sticker on the box that contains the OnePlus 12 device's details, including the IMEI number.

### Method 4: Find IMEI on a Removable Battery (for older devices)

For older Android devices with removable batteries, you can find the IMEI number printed on a sticker underneath the battery. To locate it, follow these steps:

![find imei number 06](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/05/find-imei-on-a-removable-battery.jpg)

### Method 5: Check the SIM Card Tray

Some Android devices have the IMEI number printed on the SIM card tray. To check if your device has this feature:

![check- -sim card tray](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/05/check-device-sim-card-tray.jpg)

- **Step 1:** Power off your Android device.
- **Step 2:** Use the SIM card removal tool (or a paperclip) to eject the SIM card tray.
- **Step 3:** Look for the IMEI number printed on the tray.
- **Step 4:** Note it down or take a photo for reference.

## Part 3: Does IMEI Change With SIM Card?

No, swapping or changing the SIM card does not alter the IMEI (International Mobile Equipment Identity). The IMEI persists unchanged throughout the OnePlus 12 device's lifetime, functioning as a distinctive identifier solely for that particular device.

The IMEI is a 15-digit code assigned to each mobile device. It's separate from the SIM card, which stores information related to the subscriber and the carrier network. The SIM card contains data specific to the subscriber. This includes contacts, text messages, and network-related information. But it does not alter or affect the IMEI of the OnePlus 12 device.

The IMEI remains the same even if you change SIM cards or switch between different carriers. It's essentially a static identifier tied to the OnePlus 12 device's hardware. It is used by mobile networks and authorities to identify and track devices on the network.

## Part 4: Does IMEI Change After Factory Reset?

No, performing a factory reset on your mobile device does not change its IMEI (International Mobile Equipment Identity). The IMEI is a unique identifier assigned to the hardware of the OnePlus 12 device. It remains constant throughout the life of the OnePlus 12 device, irrespective of any software changes or resets.

A factory reset wipes the data and settings on your device, returning it to its original factory state. This process erases user-installed apps, personal data, and settings. But it doesn’t affect the OnePlus 12 device's hardware identification, including the IMEI.

The IMEI is embedded into the hardware of the OnePlus 12 device. It is typically printed on the OnePlus 12 device's packaging or can be found by dialing \*#06# on the phone's keypad. It's a crucial identifier for mobile networks, and authorities use it to uniquely identify and track devices across networks. It remains unchanged even after a factory reset.
