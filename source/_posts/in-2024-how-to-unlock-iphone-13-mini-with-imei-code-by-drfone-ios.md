## Part 1: What is IMEI code? How to find IMEI Code on iPhone?

Each and every phone comes with a unique 15-digit code that differentiates it from other devices. This unique code acts as determinant or a tracking number when you happen to lose your phone. For those with iPhones, you can retrieve this unique number in different ways. The following are some of them.

**1.1 Dial \*#06#**

This is the primary method of checking your IMEI code on almost all devices. On your dial pad, dial \*#06# and press the call icon. Your unique code will be displayed immediately.

When a customer deals an agreement with a large cell phone company for a certain amount of time, they usually get a discount on a device.

### 1\. Contact your service provider

Well, this is not a quick solution. You must contact your service provider to determine the sim lock status. Generally, you have to submit a request to the company and the IMEI number. The company will later inform you about the Sim lock status of your Apple iPhone 13 mini through E-mail or any other channel.

![carrier lock](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/12/unlock-iphone-online-7.jpg)

Apple has added a new Network Provider Lock section to iOS 14 that immediately tells you the Apple iPhone 13 mini device's status.

Scroll down to find the section called "Network Provider Lock." If the Apple iPhone 13 mini is unlocked, it should say "No SIM restrictions" on the screen. If you see something different, it means the Apple iPhone 13 mini is locked.

### 3\. Check it via your IMEI code

If you know the IMEI number of your Apple iPhone 13 mini, you can get one of those online IMEI-checking tools to see if the phone it belongs to is locked. Most of these services ask for money, which is a problem but generally, they ask for a very minimal amount.

### Conclusion

So, these were the ways to unlock your Apple iPhone 13 mini online. Knowing about online unlocking services, you must have realized that you should trust them sparingly. Instead, you should go for a real solution. Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock is the best way to unlock iPhones locked to a carrier (iOS). If you don't want to contact your carrier, Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock can open any SIM-lock. This software works with iOS 12.0 to iOS 14.8.1 on iPhone 5S to iPhone X.
