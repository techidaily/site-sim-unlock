![customer service](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/02/unlock-sim-without-puk-code-02.jpg)

Here’s what you’ll need:

- **Ready your information.** Prepare your account number, phone number, and any other relevant details your carrier might require for verification.
- **Find the best contact option for you.** Most carriers offer multiple options like phone calls, online chat, or visiting a physical store. Opt for the method that best suits your preference and availability.
- **Prepare a written report of what happened.** Clearly state that you’ve locked your SIM card by entering an incorrect PIN and have lost your PUK code.
- **Verify your identity.**Answer the security questions or provide the requested account details to confirm that you’re the authorized user.
- **Receive your PUK code/new SIM card.** Once verified, the representative will provide you with your PUK code. Be sure to write it down in a secure location for future reference. They might offer you a replaced SIM card if no PUK codes exist.

### Method 2: Retrieving the PUK Code Through Your Carrier’s Website

If your carrier provides this functionality, you can retrieve your PUK code online without contacting customer service. This way, you’ll learn **how to unlock SIM cards without PUK numbers**.

Here’s how it might work:

- **Step 1:** Navigate to the secure section of your account using your login credentials. For example, this is what you can see from the JIO website:

- **Step 3:** Similar to contacting customer service, you might need to verify your account ownership through security questions or other verification methods.
- **Step 4:** Once verified, your PUK code should be displayed on the screen or sent to your registered email address.

Remember, these steps are general guidelines, and specific procedures may vary depending on your carrier. Consult your carrier’s website or contact customer service for the most accurate and up-to-date information.

There are lots of issues you may face when you try to unlock your device. The following are just some of the troubleshooting actions you can take if you encounter these problems.

**_Unlocking Code Fails to work_**

This is another service that will also provide you with phone unlock codes at a price. Just like the others, we have seen it is very easy to use and supports all devices.

To use it, select the “Unlock” option from the main menu and then choose your device's model from the drop-down menu.  Next, provide your device's details and then proceed to pay for the service and provide your name, email address, and IMEI number.

Once you click on “unlock now” all you have to do is wait the stipulated time for the codes to be sent to you.
