## Part 5: The benefits of an unlocked Xiaomi 14 Ultra

If you now know how to unlock Xiaomi 14 Ultra but still do not know its advantages, we are here to help.

As indicated in the introduction, unlocked phone users can freely choose the plans they subscribed to---on any carriers, in any country. Therefore, if you travel frequently around the world, having an unlocked Xiaomi 14 Ultra would be beneficial. Using a local SIM card is much cheaper than paying for exorbitant roaming charges.

You can also benefit from an unlocked Xiaomi 14 Ultra if you are the kind of person who likes to take advantage of current offers provided by your local carriers. Prepaid plans are always changing in terms of offering so having the flexibility of changing carriers and prepaid plans can help you save money in the long run.

## Part 6: The downside of an unlocked Xiaomi 14 Ultra

Are you thinking "Well, why can't I just buy an unlocked Xiaomi 14 Ultra in the first place?" right about now? Well, you can but think of the amount of money it will cost you.

For example, in Australia, an unlocked Xiaomi 14 Ultra will cost around $499 from any Xiaomi outlet but $0 for the Xiaomi 14 Ultra device when you pair it with a 24-month postpaid plan. While this may look attractive now, you may be paying more for a locked Xiaomi 14 Ultra in the long run.

Most importantly, if you have a locked device, always seek advice from your carrier to see if this is possible.
