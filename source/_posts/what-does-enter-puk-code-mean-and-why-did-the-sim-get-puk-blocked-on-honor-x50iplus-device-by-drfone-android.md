## What Does 'Enter PUK Code' Mean And Why Did The Sim Get PUK Blocked On Honor X50i+ Device

If your SIM card is disabled, you probably entered the incorrect PIN code too frequently. Your SIM locks itself after three to five wrong inputs, on average. Although it might be annoying, doing these guards against unauthorized access to your phone and personal data. If your cell phone is lost or stolen, PUK blocked will prevent prospective hackers from making calls.

Your mobile phone display can say ‚ÄúPIN blocked‚Äù or "Enter PUK code." PUK stands for PIN Unblocking Key in the PUK code. The PUK code is seldom given to you when you receive your membership in the US. Contact Your Honor X50i+ provider's customer support if you don't know your PUK code.

## Part 1: Why Was My Sim Card Blocked?

### 1\. 3 times incorrect Pin entered

Sometimes when you forget your pin and keep on entering the wrong one, you can get PUK Blocked. You can utilize three to five chances, and your sim gets blocked when you enter the incorrect pin in all of these attempts.

### 2\. Wrong PUK code entered

Sims are frequently blocked; therefore, if you have your PUK, keep it in a secure location separate from your phone. This is because it is the key to unlocking your SIM.¬†The SIM will be permanently disabled, and you will have to buy a new SIM card if you input the wrong PUK ten times in a row.

## Part 2: What To Do When I Blocked My Sim Card?

Your SIM card has been disabled to protect your security if you enter three wrong PINs and your phone shows "SIM card banned" or "Enter PUK code".

You must input a PUK (PIN Unlock Key) code to unlock your SIM card.

Go to your phone's settings to customize your PIN code after using a PUK code to unlock your SIM card. Pick a PIN that is simple to remember.

If your PUK code was delivered to you by email:

You got an email with multiple codes, including PUK1, PIN2, and PUK2.

![go to settings and customize to unblock sim](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/10/how-to-unlock-puk-blocked-sim-card-1.jpg)

If your PIN is locked, use PUK1 to unlock it.

Only a few phones employ PIN2 and PUK2 codes to restrict access to certain SIM card functionalities.

PIN2: The default code for your SIM card; If this code has been altered, use the PUK2 code to restore it.

PUK2: Your PIN2's unlock code if it has been blocked.

### 1\. Get it from sim card packaging

The packing box is the best and easiest place to look for the PUK code to unlock your SIM card.

You probably have memories of the flat plastic package you got when you bought a SIM card. Your PUK and default SIM pin code should be written on the package.

![find the pin code on flat plastic package](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/10/how-to-unlock-puk-blocked-sim-card-3.jpg)

Please look around your home for the package and look on the back for the key. On some older packaging, it could be sealed behind a scratchable region, whereas on other, more recent ones, you might find it unsealed.

In either case, the correct PUK has 8 numbers and should be simple to enter to unlock your SIM card.

### 2\. Have it from carrier website

In all honesty, I doubt I'll ever be able to locate my SIM card package again, and I imagine most people feel the same way.

But happily, a lot of cell companies let you access your account on their app or website to check your SIM card PUK. Please log in to the appropriate website or app, then go to your profile to see whether anything about "PUK" is available there.

![go to career website and check your sim card puk](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/10/how-to-unlock-puk-blocked-sim-card-5.jpg)

It shouldn't be an issue if you were utilizing or signed in to the platform before your SIM was disabled. However, if not, you might not be able to access anything since you could be asked to input an OTP to verify your identity.

Please remove the SIM card and try again if you can't access your phone to utilize the app or website because of the SIM lock. After receiving the PUK code, you can re-insert the SIM and input it.

### 3\. Contact your carrier

It's time to call customer support, which should be simpler for most individuals if none of the above options work for you. For example, your mobile service provider created your SIM card. Therefore, they have all the information you would require. Before they divulge anything to you, though, they should be able to verify your identity.

Use a different phone to call your customer service number and describe the issue. And following a series of inquiries, they should offer your PUK number as identification.

However, customer service won't release the code if you can't back yourself up. And at that point, there's probably nothing further you can do. Therefore, make sure you have some information, such as your name, address, date of birth, etc., before you call them.

### Unlocking

Unlocking a phone means making it compatible with other SIM carriers. An unlocked phone is not pinned to a single SIM carrier; rather, it lets you switch carriers. SIM Card lets your phone connect to a specific network, but it depends on your phone's hardware compatibility. If it's not compatible with a specific network, then nothing can change that.

To unlock your phone, you have to enter a specific code to remove the restrictions of the network. However, there are ways to unlock your phone without granting permission from the network.

### Rooting (for Android)

![androi root](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/09/root-android.jpg)

[Rooting a phone](https://drfone.wondershare.com/root/reasons-to-root-android.html) means gaining ‚Äúroot access‚Äù on another phone. **This process works for Android only.** However, it can also be used on some specific Linux-based devices. Root access allows you to do almost everything on the phone you‚Äôve gained access to, like installing or uninstalling applications or changing the settings.

Root access is not all fun, and games as this process will lead you to the security architect of your operating system, which will be hard to deal with even if you're a professional. So, it‚Äôs important to be careful with this process, else you will have to bear the consequences.

### Jailbreaking (for iOS)

![iphone Jailbreak](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/09/iphone-jailbreak.jpg)

[Jailbreaking a device](https://drfone.wondershare.com/guide/how-to-jailbreak-ios-on-windows.html) means removing all the restrictions on that device that its manufacturer's applied. **This process works specifically for Apple devices.** It lets you bypass the limitations and restrictions, so you can modify the software your way and make changes to the default program. It is also considered free booting, and Apple or any other company does not approve of it.

In summary, unlocking is primarily about freeing a device from carrier restrictions, rooting is specific to Android devices and involves gaining administrative access, while jailbreaking is specific to iOS devices and involves bypassing Apple's restrictions for more customization. All these processes come with potential risks and may void warranties, so users should carefully consider the implications before proceeding.

It is advisable to always go for the safest method, unlocking your phone. Rooting and Jailbreaking are risky security exploitations that can cause serious problems.

## Part 2: Is it Legally Allowed to Unlock Your Honor X50i+?

Every country has its own rules and regulations. Similarly, laws regarding unlocking your phones are different in different countries. However, after sessions of deliberations and consultations, the US has declared it legal to unlock your phone.

In order to legally unlock your phone, you must make sure your phone service contracts, payments, and dues are cleared. You must be the sole owner of your phone. Once your phone is eligible and falls under the requirements, you will be given an ‚ÄúUnlock Code‚Äù to proceed further.

## Part 5: Tip to Avoid the SIM Lock Issue

In order to avoid the SIM Lock issue, it is advisable to use unlocked phones. This will save you from long-term hassle as you will have the freedom to switch carriers and SIM cards whenever you like. On the other hand, if we talk about locked phones, they‚Äôre expensive and a headache to deal with because of the requirements and problems they come with.

If you're concerned about a dual-SIM phone, then you can have one SIM pinned to a good quality carrier. The other SIM can be temporary and cheap. This is an amazing option for you if you're traveling, as you'll have the flexibility to change carriers for the temporary SIM no matter wherever you are.

## Conclusion

As a crux, an unlocked phone is a better choice than a locked phone. We would personally advise you to go for unlocked phones as this will save your time and money. You will have much more freedom and flexibility for changing between SIM and SIM carriers. Whereas on the locked phones, you will be bound to one SIM. So, the next time you decide to buy a phone, give this article a read again.
