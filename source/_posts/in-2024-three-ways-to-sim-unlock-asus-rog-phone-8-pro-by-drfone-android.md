## Three Ways to Sim Unlock Asus ROG Phone 8 Pro

You probably purchased your Asus ROG Phone 8 Pro for a significant discount but are now stuck with the same network for a couple of years. You loved the Asus ROG Phone 8 Pro device but your network provider does not have any plans that exactly suit your needs. To release your device from your current network's clutches, you will need to unlock your phone.

There are three ways you can do it and this post will go through each method so that you can find one that you are most comfortable with. Do note that if your contract has ended with your network provider, this "How to unlock Asus ROG Phone 8 Pro" post can be skipped as you can just ask them to unlock your phone or purchase a [sim network unlock pin](https://drfone.wondershare.com/unlock/unlock-samsung-sim-network-unlock-pin.html) for a minimal price.

## Part 1: Asus ROG Phone 8 Pro Unlock Code

This is probably the easiest, no-fuss method to [sim unlock](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/unlock-android-screen/) Asus ROG Phone 8 Pro. Follow these steps carefully to successfully perform Asus ROG Phone 8 Pro unlock code.

You can also benefit from an unlocked Asus ROG Phone 8 Pro if you are the kind of person who likes to take advantage of current offers provided by your local carriers.

Are you thinking "Well, why can't I just buy an unlocked Asus ROG Phone 8 Pro in the first place?" right about now? Well, you can but think of the amount of money it will cost you.
