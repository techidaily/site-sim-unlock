## Part 6: The downside of an unlocked Gionee F3 Pro

Are you thinking "Well, why can't I just buy an unlocked Gionee F3 Pro in the first place?" right about now? Well, you can but think of the amount of money it will cost you.

For example, in Australia, an unlocked Gionee F3 Pro will cost around $499 from any Gionee outlet but $0 for the Gionee F3 Pro device when you pair it with a 24-month postpaid plan. While this may look attractive now, you may be paying more for a locked Gionee F3 Pro in the long run.

## Conclusion

Now that you know the three ways of unlocking your Gionee F3 Pro, all you need to do is find one that is most compatible with you. Just remember to think of everything through and carefully. Most importantly, if you have a locked device, always seek advice from your carrier to see if this is possible.
