## How Do I SIM Unlock My Apple iPhone 11 Pro?

If your Apple iPhone 11 Pro is locked to a particular carrier, it can be very frustrating. This is because your device will only be able to work with a SIM card from that provider and no other. This can be a problem when you want to change carriers. Some iPhones are generally easier to unlock than others, and the easiest way to unlock any iPhone is usually to use a paid online service. The issue is that these services can be very expensive.

In this article, we are going to look at how you can [sim unlock](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/unlock-android-screen/) your Apple iPhone 11 Pro. It is however important to note that if you purchased your device in the last one year, it is already unlocked.

Many people may wonder whether it is legal to unlock the iPhone. Actually, it is perfectly legal to unlock your Apple iPhone 11 Pro if you have completed payments on the contract, or you bought the Apple iPhone 11 Pro device outright. If however, you are still in the process of paying for your contract, you don't fully own the phone and so you should contact the carrier before unlocking it.

But if your Apple iPhone 11 Pro has [bad ESN](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/iphone-unlock/) or been blacklisted by the carrier, you can check the new post here to check what to do if you have a [blacklisted iPhone](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/iphone-unlock/).

##  Part 1: How to SIM Unlock Your Apple iPhone 11 Pro?

There are several ways to unlock your device. Let's look at a few of them.

### 1\. Contact your Carrier and Have them unlock the Apple iPhone 11 Pro device for you

This is probably the safest way to do it. If you have already completed payments on your Apple iPhone 11 Pro or you bought it outright, you can ask your carrier for the [sim network unlock pin](https://drfone.wondershare.com/unlock/unlock-samsung-sim-network-unlock-pin.html) to unlock your device. Depending on your carrier, you may have to pay for this service, and it also does take up to 7 days, sometimes more for them to get back to you.

### 2\. Software Unlocking

This is where you download a piece of [sim network unlock pin software](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/unlock-android-screen/) on to your device. This software makes changes to the Apple iPhone 11 Pro device, allowing you to make calls from any carrier. While this may sound straight-forward and easy, except it is highly risky and will not work for iPhone 4 and later models.

### 3\. Hardware Unlocking

This is where you alter the hardware of the Apple iPhone 11 Pro device to create an alternate path to deliver calls. Although this can be done, it also alters your device irreparably and probably also voids your warranty. Not to mention, you may pay more than $200 to have the Apple iPhone 11 Pro device unlocked in this way.

### 4\. IMEI unlocking

This is the best way to unlock your device and by far the easiest. This method uses your device's IMEI number to access the IMEI database and change the status of the Apple iPhone 11 Pro from locked to unlocked. There are very many services that you can use to IMEI unlock your device, and most of them will offer the service for a fee. But this is a great solution because there is no software to download, and you don't mess with the hardware in any way.

### Check the unlock prerequisites

To check the unlock prerequisites, Go to Settings > General > About to find out if your Apple iPhone 11 Pro is locked. Your Apple iPhone 11 Pro is unlocked if it says "No SIM restrictions" next to "Carrier Lock."

### Contact the carrier for the unlock code

Large cell phone companies often offer discounted devices to customers who sign an agreement for set time frames. Because of this, the Apple iPhone 11 Pro device comes with a controller lock so customers can only use it on their network. If your contract with the company is over, you can get out of it for free. Before you can unlock your Apple iPhone 11 Pro, you must meet the following requirements:

First of all, it must be a legal device. It means the Apple iPhone 11 Pro device is not reported as lost, stolen. Then your bank account must not have any financial debts. If you signed a contract in exchange for a lower up-front cost, you'd have to wait until your contract ends (usually 24 months) or pay the remaining balance if you purchased your phone on a payment schedule.

Most carriers need active accounts for specific days before unlocking devices. Sprint has 50 days, T-Mobile 40, and AT&T 60. Verizon has no minimum period if you need to factory reset your phone to use the new network and back up beforehand.

### Insert a new SIM card to unlock your device

If you have a non-carrier SIM card, complete iPhone unlocking using these steps:

- Turn off your device.
- SIM card out.
- Insert the new SIM. Your device will be activated.

### Conclusion

So, this was an overview of some popular unlocking tools for Apple iPhone 11 Pro. The most accurate and effective tool to unlock carrier-locked iPhones is Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock (iOS). If your Apple iPhone 11 Pro is locked, then it must be for some reason. The carrier who has set this lock can provide the best solution. However, Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock can unlock any lock.
