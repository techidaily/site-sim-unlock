### 1\. No Due Before Unlocking

When iPhone users sign contracts with a giant cell phone company for a certain amount of time, they often get a discount on a device. Because of this, the Apple iPhone 7 Plus device comes with a controller lock so customers can only use it on their network.

So, if you've paid off your contract or bought your Apple iPhone 7 Plus without a subsidy, it's perfectly legal to unlock it. But if you're still paying off your contract, you still need to own the Apple iPhone 7 Plus fully, so you should confirm with your carrier before unlocking it.

### 2\. You Should Buy It for More Than the Time Limit in the Contract

You can leave without paying anything if your agreement with the company is over. If you signed a contract in exchange for a lower price upfront, you would have to wait until your contract ended (usually 24 months) or pay the remaining balance if you bought your phone on a payment plan.
