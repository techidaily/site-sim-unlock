(Verizon/AT&T/T-Mobile as example)

### How to unlock the Apple iPhone 7 Plus locked by Verizon

To prevent theft and other types of fraud, Verizon locks new devices to only work on the Verizon network. The company has different rules for unlocking prepaid and post-pay devices, as well as special rules for people in the military who are distributed.

"Unlocking" a device means turning off Software that would stop a customer from trying to use a device made for one carrier's network on another carrier's network. Due to different technologies, a Verizon Wireless device that has been unlocked may only work partially on another carrier's network.

![verizon](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/12/unlock-iphone-se-4.jpg)

**Verizon's Policy for unlocking Post-pay devices**

If you buy a phone from Verizon, it will be locked for 60 days after you buy it. If you buy a device from one of their authorized retailers, it will be locked for 60 days after it is activated.

After 60 days, the lock will be taken off itself unless the Apple iPhone 7 Plus device is found to be stolen or was bought through fraud. After 60 days, their phones are never locked again.

**Unlocking Verizon's Prepaid Device**

After activation, devices you buy from Verizon and some devices you buy from one of their authorized retailers are locked for 60 days. After 60 days, the lock will be taken off itself unless the Apple iPhone 7 Plus device is found to be stolen or was bought through fraud. After the first 60 days, their phones are locked, but after that, they never lock them again.

**Military Personnel Placement Unlocking Policy**

If you are in the military and a Verizon Wireless customer, in case, you get orders to move outside of the Verizon Coverage Area. The company will unlock your device and stop your service if you ask, even if it has only been 60 days since you bought it.

### Contact your carrier to unlock it with the IMEI code

When a customer deals an agreement with a large cell phone company for a certain amount of time, they usually get a discount on a device.

Before you can unlock your Apple iPhone 7 Plus, you have to do the following:

First, it has to be legal. It means the Apple iPhone 7 Plus device has not been reported as lost, stolen, or linked to a crime.

Then your bank account shouldn't have any debts. If you signed a contract in exchange for a lower price upfront, you would have to wait until your contract was up (usually 24 months) or pay the remaining balance if you bought your phone on a payment plan. Each company has its way of unlocking.
