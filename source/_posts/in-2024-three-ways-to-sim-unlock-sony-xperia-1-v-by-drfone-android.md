## Three Ways to Sim Unlock Sony Xperia 1 V

You probably purchased your Sony Xperia 1 V for a significant discount but are now stuck with the same network for a couple of years. You loved the Sony Xperia 1 V device but your network provider does not have any plans that exactly suit your needs. To release your device from your current network's clutches, you will need to unlock your phone.

There are three ways you can do it and this post will go through each method so that you can find one that you are most comfortable with. Do note that if your contract has ended with your network provider, this "How to unlock Sony Xperia 1 V" post can be skipped as you can just ask them to unlock your phone or purchase a [sim network unlock pin](https://drfone.wondershare.com/unlock/unlock-samsung-sim-network-unlock-pin.html) for a minimal price.

## Part 1: Sony Xperia 1 V Unlock Code

This is probably the easiest, no-fuss method to [sim unlock](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/unlock-android-screen/) Sony Xperia 1 V. Follow these steps carefully to successfully perform Sony Xperia 1 V unlock code.

Do take note that this process may not work with your carrier. Therefore, always check if this is the right way to obtain the necessary code:

## Part 3: Sony Xperia 1 V Unlock Carrier

If your Sony Xperia 1 V is hard locked, this is your best bet in getting your device unlocked. Actually, it is the safest method among all three:

1. Get a new SIM card from a new carrier.
2. Call your carrier's customer service line and ask what are the requirements to qualify you to get your Sony Xperia 1 V unlocked.

HOWEVER, if your first instinct is to head to Google Play to look for SIM unlock tools, heed these cautions.

## Part 5: The benefits of an unlocked Sony Xperia 1 V

If you now know how to unlock Sony Xperia 1 V but still do not know its advantages, we are here to help.

As indicated in the introduction, unlocked phone users can freely choose the plans they subscribed to---on any carriers, in any country. Therefore, if you travel frequently around the world, having an unlocked Sony Xperia 1 V would be beneficial. Using a local SIM card is much cheaper than paying for exorbitant roaming charges.

You can also benefit from an unlocked Sony Xperia 1 V if you are the kind of person who likes to take advantage of current offers provided by your local carriers. Prepaid plans are always changing in terms of offering so having the flexibility of changing carriers and prepaid plans can help you save money in the long run.

## Part 6: The downside of an unlocked Sony Xperia 1 V

Are you thinking "Well, why can't I just buy an unlocked Sony Xperia 1 V in the first place?" right about now? Well, you can but think of the amount of money it will cost you.

For example, in Australia, an unlocked Sony Xperia 1 V will cost around $499 from any Sony outlet but $0 for the Sony Xperia 1 V device when you pair it with a 24-month postpaid plan. While this may look attractive now, you may be paying more for a locked Sony Xperia 1 V in the long run.

## Conclusion

Now that you know the three ways of unlocking your Sony Xperia 1 V, all you need to do is find one that is most compatible with you. Just remember to think of everything through and carefully. Most importantly, if you have a locked device, always seek advice from your carrier to see if this is possible.
