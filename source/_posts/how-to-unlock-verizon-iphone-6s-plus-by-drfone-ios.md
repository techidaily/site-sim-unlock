## Part 4: How to unlock Verizon iPhone via Verizon

This is an alternative means by which you can unlock Verizon iPhone 5. However, before we show you how to unlock Verizon iPhone, we should probably answer some frequently asked questions about this.

#### Can Verizon iPhones be unlocked?

The long and short of this is: YES, Verizon iPhones can be unlocked.

#### Will Verizon Unlock my Phone?

Now here's the kicker. Verizon is actually one of the most relaxed carriers out there and they don't generally lock their devices to begin with. However, YES, if your device is locked, Verizon does offer the service to unlock your phone if you contact them.

#### How to unlock Verizon iPhone via Verizon

As mentioned above, Verizon is surprisingly lax when it comes to locking phones, especially iPhones. In fact all Verizon 4G LTE devices are never locked to begin with, you can directly use them with any other carriers. So, if you want to shift Carriers, they just have a bunch of requirements that you need to meet first:

1\. If the phone was purchased on a 2 year contract then your contract needs to be complete with all 24 months paid for.

2\. If the purchase of the Apple iPhone 6s Plus device was financed by Verizon Edge, or a two-year device payment plan, in that case you need to have paid off all overdue bills before you shift.

3\. The device shouldn't currently be reported as lost or stolen. Furthermore, if the Apple iPhone 6s Plus device has ever been associated with any form of fraudulent activity then you aren't eligible.

4\. And if your phone still seems locked for none of the stated reasons you just contact them directly and they'll take care of it. There is no complicated means of doing this.

If you meet these requirements then you don't need to bother unlocking it, you can simply use another carrier.

If this seems too good to be true, or you have trouble believing us, then head on over to their Unlocking Policies and read it for yourself, just follow this link: [http://www.verizon.com/about/consumer-safety/device-unlocking-policy](http://www.verizon.com/about/consumer-safety/device-unlocking-policy)

Here's a little screenshot for you:

## Part 5: How to check your Verizon iPhone unlock status

If you're not sure whether you're still within the 2 year contract period or aren't sure whether your phone model is eligible for automatic unlock, then you can simply verify that via DoctorSIM with an easy 3-step process. You should avail of this before going through any official channels to unlock Verizon iPhone 5. All you have to do is go to this link [here](https://www.doctorsim.com/libtrkafl.html?pc=43d47c30d945bcbd7d9527f4049f649a&refe=https://www.doctorsim.com/us-en/?scp&euro) and then follow the given steps.

## Part 3: Enter the ICCID Code on Your Apple iPhone 6s Plus – Top Methods

Now that you know how to find your ICCID code, it's time to use it. Using the **ICCID number iPhone unlock** code, you can unlock your Apple iPhone 6s Plus's full potential. In this section, we will walk you through two of the top methods for inputting the ICCID code:

### Method 1: GPP LTE Chip

An array of techniques are available for entering the ICCID code on your Apple iPhone 6s Plus. Among them, the GPP LTE chip method stands out as a reliable and effective approach. This method capitalizes on a specialized chip to streamline the process. It provides users a seamless pathway to unlock their iPhone's network potential. By following these clear steps, users can leverage the power of the GPP LTE chip:

- **Step 1:** Begin by locating and opening the "Settings" application on your Apple iPhone 6s Plus. Inside the Settings app, navigate through the available options and select the one labeled "SIM." Within the SIM settings, you'll come across an option referred to as "ICCID."
- **Step 2:** This is where you'll need to input the new ICCID obtained from the aforementioned websites. Following the ICCID entry, you'll encounter a menu. Here, choose "Perfect" or "Sharp" mode.
- **Step 3:** Open the slot for your SIM card, remove the SIM card, and insert the GPP activation chip in its place. Now, put the SIM card above the chip and put it back into your Apple iPhone 6s Plus. After securing the new SIM card, connect your Apple iPhone 6s Plus to a Wi-Fi network.
- **Step 4:** With the new SIM card in place and a stable Wi-Fi connection established, give the GPP chip a few minutes to recognize the new SIM card. During this time, the chip will configure itself to work with the new ICCID.

### Method 2: Using an R-SIM

An R-SIM, or SIM interposer, acts as a bridge between your [<u>SIM card</u>](https://drfone.wondershare.com/sim-unlock/free-sim-network-unlock-pin.html) and the iPhone's hardware. It enables you to input the ICCID code and access a wider range of carrier options. This method is particularly useful if you're looking for a seamless and reliable way to configure your Apple iPhone 6s Plus's network settings. Below, we have gone through the steps of using an R-SIM to input the ICCID code:

- **Step 1:** Begin by inserting the R-SIM card into your Apple iPhone 6s Plus's SIM card tray. Ensure it is properly positioned and securely placed. For R-SIM versions starting from 14 and above, there's no need to manually dial a code. Upon inserting the R-SIM card, the Apple iPhone 6s Plus device will automatically prompt you with a menu.
- **Step 2:** However, for earlier versions, open the Call app on your Apple iPhone 6s Plus. Dial 50057672\*00# and initiate the call. This action will trigger the appearance of the R-SIM menu. Once the R-SIM menu is visible, select the option labeled "Edit ICCID."
- **Step 3:** Now, enter the ICCID unlock code you got from the website mentioned above. With the new ICCID successfully entered, restart your Apple iPhone 6s Plus. After the reboot, your Apple iPhone 6s Plus will recognize the updated ICCID and establish a connection with the desired network.
