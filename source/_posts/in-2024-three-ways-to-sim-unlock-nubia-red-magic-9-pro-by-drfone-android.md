## Three Ways to Sim Unlock Nubia Red Magic 9 Pro

You probably purchased your Nubia Red Magic 9 Pro for a significant discount but are now stuck with the same network for a couple of years. You loved the Nubia Red Magic 9 Pro device but your network provider does not have any plans that exactly suit your needs. To release your device from your current network's clutches, you will need to unlock your phone.

There are three ways you can do it and this post will go through each method so that you can find one that you are most comfortable with. Do note that if your contract has ended with your network provider, this "How to unlock Nubia Red Magic 9 Pro" post can be skipped as you can just ask them to unlock your phone or purchase a [sim network unlock pin](https://drfone.wondershare.com/unlock/unlock-samsung-sim-network-unlock-pin.html) for a minimal price.

## Part 1: Nubia Red Magic 9 Pro Unlock Code

This is probably the easiest, no-fuss method to [sim unlock](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/unlock-android-screen/) Nubia Red Magic 9 Pro. Follow these steps carefully to successfully perform Nubia Red Magic 9 Pro unlock code.

Do take note that this process may not work with your carrier. Therefore, always check if this is the right way to obtain the necessary code:

- 1\. Check the SIM lock status---you can do this by dialing **\*#\*#7378423#\*#\***.

![sony xperia unlock code](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2016/08/14707989592943.jpg)

- 2\. Tap **Service info** then **Sim lock**.

![unlock with sony xperia unlock code](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2016/08/14707989592897.jpg)

- 3\. The number beside **Network** indicates how many attempts you have to unlock the phone. If it says '7' it means you have seven attempts; '0' simply means it is hard locked and cannot be unlocked using this method.

![unlock code sony xperia](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2016/08/14707989597664.jpg)

- 4\. Find the **IMEI number** by dialing **\*#06#**. Jot it down as this will be your code.

## Part 2: The Best Nubia Red Magic 9 Pro SIM Unlock Code Generator

To safely and successfully sim unlock your Nubia Red Magic 9 Pro, it is important to find a trustworthy [sim network unlock pin software](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/unlock-android-screen/).

If your Nubia Red Magic 9 Pro is hard locked, this is your best bet in getting your device unlocked. Actually, it is the safest method among all three:

1. Get a new SIM card from a new carrier.
2. Call your carrier's customer service line and ask what are the requirements to qualify you to get your Nubia Red Magic 9 Pro unlocked.

## Part 5: The benefits of an unlocked Nubia Red Magic 9 Pro

If you now know how to unlock Nubia Red Magic 9 Pro but still do not know its advantages, we are here to help.

As indicated in the introduction, unlocked phone users can freely choose the plans they subscribed to---on any carriers, in any country. Therefore, if you travel frequently around the world, having an unlocked Nubia Red Magic 9 Pro would be beneficial. Using a local SIM card is much cheaper than paying for exorbitant roaming charges.

You can also benefit from an unlocked Nubia Red Magic 9 Pro if you are the kind of person who likes to take advantage of current offers provided by your local carriers. Prepaid plans are always changing in terms of offering so having the flexibility of changing carriers and prepaid plans can help you save money in the long run.

## Part 6: The downside of an unlocked Nubia Red Magic 9 Pro

Are you thinking "Well, why can't I just buy an unlocked Nubia Red Magic 9 Pro in the first place?" right about now? Well, you can but think of the amount of money it will cost you.

For example, in Australia, an unlocked Nubia Red Magic 9 Pro will cost around $499 from any Nubia outlet but $0 for the Nubia Red Magic 9 Pro device when you pair it with a 24-month postpaid plan. While this may look attractive now, you may be paying more for a locked Nubia Red Magic 9 Pro in the long run.

## Conclusion

Now that you know the three ways of unlocking your Nubia Red Magic 9 Pro, all you need to do is find one that is most compatible with you. Just remember to think of everything through and carefully. Most importantly, if you have a locked device, always seek advice from your carrier to see if this is possible.
