## How to Unlock Apple iPhone 13 with IMEI Code?

If you have a locked iPhone, we have different methods that entail how to unlock iPhone with IMEI code. Apart from this, we have two separate unlocking methods which usually confuse a good number of people. These methods are Sim Unlock and iCloud activation lock bypass. The difference between the two is that the Sim unlock method involves unlocking the sim lock while the iCloud activation revolves around unlocking the automatic iCloud activation security feature.  

If you want to know how to unlock iPhone with IMEI number and how to bypass iCloud lock, I have with me two different methods that will unlock your locked iPhone in a span of days as long as you follow the required steps.  

## Part 1: What is IMEI code? How to find IMEI Code on iPhone?

Each and every phone comes with a unique 15-digit code that differentiates it from other devices. This unique code acts as determinant or a tracking number when you happen to lose your phone. For those with iPhones, you can retrieve this unique number in different ways. The following are some of them.

**1.1 Dial \*#06#**

This is the primary method of checking your IMEI code on almost all devices. On your dial pad, dial \*#06# and press the call icon. Your unique code will be displayed immediately.

**1.2 The Sim Tray**

Another way of retrieving your IMEI code is by removing your Sim Card tray. In most devices especially iPhone 4, this number is usually located on the Sim tray.

**1.3 The Back of the Phone**

If you are operating on an iPhone 5, 5C, SE, 6, or 6S, you can retrieve your unique code at the back of your Apple iPhone 13.
