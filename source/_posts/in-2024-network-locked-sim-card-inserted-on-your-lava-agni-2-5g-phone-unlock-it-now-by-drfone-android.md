## Network Locked SIM Card Inserted On Your Lava Agni 2 5G Phone? Unlock It Now

Carriers provide cellular connections so you can access the Internet, send text messages, and make phone calls without Wi-Fi. You cannot escape the carriers once you begin using a cell phone.

Customers can purchase a new handset via carriers or the mobile phone market. You may need an unlocked phone if you wish to use a different carrier's service on your smartphone. However, if you want a gadget linked to a specific SIM card, you may buy one from the carriers for a reduced price.

## Part 1: What Does It Mean If Your Lava Agni 2 5G Asks for SIM Network PIN?

When your phone prompts you to enter a SIM Network Unlock PIN, it means that your device is currently locked to a specific mobile network carrier, and it can only be used with SIM cards from that carrier. This locking mechanism is usually put in place by the carrier or the phone manufacturer to ensure that you continue to use their services, typically for the duration of a contract. As a result, your phone cannot be freely used with SIM cards from other carriers until it's unlocked using the correct PIN or code.

## Part 2: Why Does Your Lava Agni 2 5G Say Invalid SIM Card – Network Locked SIM Card Inserted?

![remove network lock](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/11/fix-network-locked-simcard-inserted-2.jpg)

**System Errors**

Since SIM locking is a smartphone restriction implemented to stop it from being used on other networks, Android system errors can cause network-locked SIM cards. Resetting these errors can help unlock your **network locked SIM card inserted** device. Service providers decided to provide a formal SIM unlocking option as a result.

Because of this, any locked SIM may be readily unlocked, and once a device opens, it can work like a conventional mobile phone and with any SIM card of the user's choosing.

**Carrier Lock**

The consumer must stick with the same service provider for a specific time after purchasing the bundled device and data pack. This is called a carrier lock on the Lava Agni 2 5G device and is one of the most common errors in **network locked SIM card inserted** devices. During that time, the Lava Agni 2 5G device will be network- or SIM-locked, prohibiting the user from changing service providers.

The user cannot change the SIM. The service provider will offer the SIM Unlock code needed to unlock the handset when the contract expires. The gadget can be used with any other SIM card and exported to another country without problems when the network lock has been removed.

**Region Lock**

Apple and AT&T initially worked together to implement the SIM lock and the SIM locked devices. The original purpose was to force the user to continue using the same service provider in a specific area or time.

However, some telecom service providers sell the handsets with select data plans as bundled plans in collaboration with the Lava Agni 2 5G device manufacturers. As a result, the handset will cost less than it would otherwise. Sometimes, these offers are particular to a specific region, called a carrier lock.

**Firmware Problems**

Sometimes, the Lava Agni 2 5G device manufacturers release many versions of the same firmware for different geographical locations.

As a result, it may be possible that the user may face contradictions in the agreement of device firmware and the network-locked SIM card that was supposed to be used on the Lava Agni 2 5G device. Due to firmware problems, the users may also face a network-locked SIM card-inserted device.

## Part 3: How to Unlock Network Locked SIM Card Inserted?

Unlocking a network-locked SIM card may seem like a complex task. However, it can be a straightforward process if you follow the right steps. In this section, we will guide you through the process of unlocking your network-locked SIM card. We will discuss 3 different ways you can unlock a **network-locked SIM card inserted**:

### Method 1. Contact Network Carrier to Unlock Network Locked SIM

Contacting your network carrier is often the most recommended choice. It is a straightforward and reliable method to unlock your network-locked SIM card. Unlocking your network-locked SIM card through your carrier is a reliable and legal method. Before contacting your carrier, get information like your device's IMEI number and account details. There are several ways to get in touch with your network carrier's customer support.

You can call the customer support hotline, visit the website, or go to a physical store. The process usually involves receiving an unlock network code, which you need to use. Once you've entered the unlock code, your phone should display that it's now unlocked. Test it with the new SIM card to ensure that it can make calls, send texts, and access mobile data without any issues.

### Method 2. Use Online Unlock Service to Unlock Network Locked SIM

There are many online services available for unlocking a **network-locked SIM card**. In case you don't want to go through your network carrier, these can be a good alternative. These services employ the IMEI number of the Lava Agni 2 5G device to unlock smartphones.

One such service is [Canada Unlocking](https://canadaunlocking.com/), which offers to unlock your network-locked SIM card via email. Follow these steps to unlock a network-locked SIM card via online services:

### Bonus Tip. How to Unlock Network Locked Sim Card Inserted on iPhone?

It enables users to safely unlock their devices within five minutes. With Dr.Fone, you don’t have to wait for the sim-unlock code or reset your device firmware that can remove all your data.

You can download Dr.Fone on your PC and use it to unlock your iPhone without data loss. You can also use Dr.Fone to unlock your iPhone’s screen lock and Apple ID. Although Dr.Fone is a one-stop solution for all of your phone-related problems, its sim-unlock only works for Apple devices. Here is how you unlock your carrier-locked iPhone with Dr.Fone – Screen Unlock (IOS).

- Download and install Dr.Fone on your PC. Launch the application and select the “Screen Unlock” tab from the list on the homepage.

![homepage](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/drfone-home.png)

- Now, click on the “Remove SIM Locked” tab on the next page. You can only use it to unlock iPhones.

![screen unlock page](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/remove-iphone-sim-1.png)

- Connect your iPhone and PC with a USB cable. Once your device is ready, click on the “Start” option to proceed with the sim unlock process.

- Next, the system will detect the Lava Agni 2 5G device connection, then its information will show up on your PC screen. If all of it is OK, click on the “Unlock Now” option.

![verify your device](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/remove-iphone-sim-3.png)

- You cannot unlock your iPhone without a jailbreak, so you must do it before the system unlocks it.

The process is compatible with devices running iOS 12 to iOS 14.8.1.

![sim lock removed](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/remove-iphone-sim-7.png)


## Part 4: Why is SIM Unlocking Important?

As previously stated, a SIM lock enables a service provider to stop a customer from using the smartphone with the SIM cards of another service provider. This guarantees that the Lava Agni 2 5G device is only being used with the original SIM card for each provider. This locking also has a lot of drawbacks because it is incompatible with any other SIM card.

1. The phone cannot be used with other SIM cards if the SIM lock is enabled. Customers must therefore adhere to the current plan as is.
2. Since nobody wants to purchase a locked phone, it is hard for someone to sell or gift the mobile.
3. Traveling abroad with a SIM-locked phone could provide some challenges because you won't be able to use a local SIM card on the phone while you're there.

All the problems can be fixed, and the SIM works in any nation with the removed SIM lock.

### Conclusion

Any of the methods above can work to get around the prohibition against using other SIM cards with your Android handset. The best thing about using Dr.Fone-Screen Unlock is that you don't need unlocking codes to complete the tasks.

## Ways To Find Unlocking Codes For Lava Agni 2 5G Phones

Whatever the reason, you should be able to unlock your device easily. But this has often proven difficult because of the fact that you need unlock codes.

## What Is a SIM Network Unlock PIN? Get Your Lava Agni 2 5G Phone Network-Ready

A network-locked device tethers you to one carrier, limiting your choices. You might miss out on better deals, struggle with roaming charges abroad, or feel inconvenienced by limited coverage. And you can’t avoid these things without the right **SIM network unlock PIN**.

That’s why we’ve created this comprehensive guide to help you unlock your phone’s potential. This article will explain what a **SIM network unlock PIN** is, the process involved, and answer any questions you might have. Keep scrolling to learn more.

![enter sim network unlock pin](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/02/sim-network-unlock-pin-01.jpg)

## Part 1: Why Is Your Lava Agni 2 5G Asking for a SIM Network Unlock PIN?

You just bought a new phone, excited to use it with a new SIM card. But your phone pops up with a request for a PIN code to unlock it. What’s that all about, and what do you enter? There are two main reasons why your phone might be asking for a SIM PIN or unlock code:

SIM Network Lock

The SIM Network Lock is a restriction placed by your phone’s original network provider, locking it to their network. It means you can only use the Lava Agni 2 5G device with SIM cards from that specific carrier. Carriers use this to ensure that the phones they sell work only with their service. When you buy a subsidized phone, they want to ensure you stick around for the contract duration.

If you insert a SIM card from a different carrier, your phone will ask for a **SIM Network Unlock PIN** or Network Unlock Code (NUC). You’ll learn more about it in the upcoming sections of this article.

SIM Card Lock

SIM Card Lock is a security feature that protects your SIM card from unauthorized use on other devices. It requires you to enter a PIN (Personal Identification Number) to unlock the SIM card before you can use it.

The default PIN is usually printed on the back of the SIM card or its packaging. If you haven’t changed your PIN, use the 4-8 digit code provided by the carrier when you get your SIM card.

![sim card lock pin](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/02/sim-network-unlock-pin-02.jpg)

If you’ve forgotten the **SIM PIN code**, you can use the PUK (PIN Unlock Key) code to unlock the SIM and set a new PIN. The PUK code is also printed on the SIM card packaging, but be careful, as entering the wrong PUK code too many times can permanently lock the SIM card.

Not knowing the **SIM unlock PIN** code can be frustrating, especially if you want to switch mobile carriers. So, in the next part, we’ll explore whether it’s possible to unlock a SIM network-locked iPhone device.

## Part 2: Can a SIM Network Locked iPhone Be Unlocked?

Yes, a SIM network-locked iPhone can be unlocked by your network provider. Insert a new SIM card, and you’ll be prompted to enter the **SIM Network Unlock PIN**. After inputting the correct unlock code, your iPhone is ready to use with any carrier.

![sim not valid message on iphone](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/02/sim-network-unlock-pin-03.jpg)

If you are thinking about unlocking your iPhone, it’s crucial to grasp what a **SIM Network Unlock PIN** is and how it functions.

## Part 3: What Is a SIM Network Unlock PIN?

A **SIM network unlock PIN** is a code allowing you to remove your phone’s network lock. It means you can use your phone with a SIM card from any compatible network provider, not just the one you originally bought it from. It is also known as Network Unlock PIN (NUP), Network Control Key (NCK), or Network Unlock Code (NUC).

Unlocking your device can be useful if you:

- Bought a phone locked to a specific carrier and want to switch to a different one.
- Are planning a trip abroad and want to use a local SIM card instead.

![international travel illustration](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/02/sim-network-unlock-pin-04.jpg)

- Still haven’t finished your contract with your original carrier and want to keep the phone but use a different service.
- Bought a phone second-hand locked to the previous owner’s network.
- Want to increase your phone’s resale value; unlocked phones generally have a higher resale value than locked phones, as various buyers can use them.
- Want more carrier flexibility; you are not tied to one carrier and can choose the provider that best suits your needs in terms of price, coverage, data plans, and other features.

Things To Consider

Before you proceed, here are some key points to remember:

- Eligibility: Not all phones are eligible for network unlocking. Check with your carrier or manufacturer for details.
- Costs: While some carriers can give **SIM network unlock PIN for free**, others may charge a fee. Third-party unlocking services also typically charge a fee.
- Waiting time: It can take days or even weeks to receive your **SIM unlock PIN**code from your carrier and process it. For instance, Vodafone usually unlocks the Lava Agni 2 5G device within 72 hours to 10 days if they have to reach the manufacturer.
- Risks: Using an unauthorized unlocking method could damage your phone or void its warranty.
- Backup: Before unlocking your phone, back up your data, as the process may erase it.

Now that you understand **SIM Network Unlock PIN**, let’s get down to business! In the final part, we’ll guide you through the two ways of unlocking your iPhone for a new carrier.

## Part 4: How To Unlock Your iPhone for a New Carrier?

Method 2: Get a SIM Network Unlock Pin for Free From the Network Carrier

Requesting a **SIM network unlock PIN for free** is usually straightforward. iPhones purchased from carriers are often locked to their network for a certain period (AT&T and Verizon require 60 days).

- **Step 1:** Visit your carrier’s website or contact them to confirm if your phone is eligible for unlocking.
- **Step 2:** If eligible, submit a request through your carrier’s website or app. You may need to provide information like your IMEI number, account details, and proof of purchase.

![iphone device information](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/02/sim-network-unlock-pin-11.jpg)

- **Step 3:** Depending on your carrier, you might receive the unlock code after a few days or weeks. It might be delivered via email, text message, or online account.
- **Step 4:** Follow the instructions provided by your carrier for your phone model. It usually involves inserting a SIM card from a different carrier and entering the **SIM network unlock PIN** code when prompted.

Important notes:

- Some carriers may charge a fee for unlocking your phone and only unlock devices for customers in good standing with their accounts.
- Unlocking your phone may not be possible, depending on your contract, device financing, or other factors.
- Ensure you follow your carrier’s instructions for unlocking your phone model to avoid issues.

## Conclusion

Unlocking your phone opens a world of flexibility and potential savings. You’re free to choose any carrier, access more international roaming options, and even boost your phone’s resale value.

But remember, safety first! Avoid shady websites or unofficial tools promising instant unlocks. These can be risky and even harm your device.

Instead, opt for safe and legal methods. Contact your carrier directly to request a **SIM network unlock PIN** or use a reputable tool like Dr.Fone Remove SIM Lock. It offers a user-friendly interface and an efficient way to unlock your phone, empowering you to maximize your device usage.

_**Tips:** Are you searching for a powerful Screen Unlock tool? No worries as [Dr.Fone](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare-dr-fone-unlock-android-screen/) is here to help you. Download it and start a seamless unlock experience!_
