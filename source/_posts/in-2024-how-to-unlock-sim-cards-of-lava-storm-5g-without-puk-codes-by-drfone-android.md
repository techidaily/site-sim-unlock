Be prepared to answer security questions and provide relevant account details to ensure a smooth process.

![customer service](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/02/unlock-sim-without-puk-code-02.jpg)

Here’s what you’ll need:

- **Ready your information.** Prepare your account number, phone number, and any other relevant details your carrier might require for verification.
- **Find the best contact option for you.** Most carriers offer multiple options like phone calls, online chat, or visiting a physical store. Opt for the method that best suits your preference and availability.
- **Prepare a written report of what happened.** Clearly state that you’ve locked your SIM card by entering an incorrect PIN and have lost your PUK code.
- **Verify your identity.**Answer the security questions or provide the requested account details to confirm that you’re the authorized user.
- **Receive your PUK code/new SIM card.** Once verified, the representative will provide you with your PUK code. Be sure to write it down in a secure location for future reference. They might offer you a replaced SIM card if no PUK codes exist.
- **Unlock your SIM card.**Enter the PUK code on your phone following the specific instructions provided by your carrier. This typically involves entering the PUK code followed by a new PIN.
