2. _Information did you provided me is wrong, because several times I contacted to Sprint and T-Mobile bile, and then confirm that the phone by IMEI that I provided he’s not in their database. -- [from Trustpilot](https://www.trustpilot.com/reviews/63e4eb2a9b64b1bdaf51d49f) _

_**Tips:** You're going on a trip to Frankfort, but forgot to unlock your Apple iPhone SE (2020). You need to unlock it first, because you will get a message: "This iPhone is locked and cannot be used with another carrier." I highly recommend using [Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock (iOS)](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/iphone-unlock/) to remove SIM lock if you have the need. This software is user-friendly, effective, and reliable, ensuring that your device is unlocked without any issues._

### 2\. IMEI Analyzer

![imei analyzer logo](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/05/imei-analyzer-logo.jpg)

Aside from just allowing you to check whether the IMEI number provided is valid, [IMEI Analyzer](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.vndnguyen.imeianalyze&hl=en) will also provide you with data about your device based on the IMEI (International Mobile Equipment Identity) number . It also has an additional feature that calculates the IMEI number when you enter only 15 digits. It also analyses the IMEI number providing you with different information about the number itself such as the Serial Number (SNR), Type Allocation Code (TAC), Reporting body identifier, Final Assembly Code, and Check Digit.

By using an IMEI Analyzer, users can validate the IMEI number, check if the Apple iPhone SE (2020) device is blacklisted or stolen, and obtain information about the Apple iPhone SE (2020) device's brand, model, and specifications. This can be particularly useful when buying a used mobile device or trying to recover a lost or stolen one. Some IMEI analyzers may also provide additional features such as warranty status checks, carrier information, and SIM lock status.
