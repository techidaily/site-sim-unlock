If your carrier provides this functionality, you can retrieve your PUK code online without contacting customer service. This way, you’ll learn **how to unlock SIM cards without PUK numbers**.

Here’s how it might work:

- **Step 1:** Navigate to the secure section of your account using your login credentials. For example, this is what you can see from the JIO website:
